       "  'article': \"SEOUL, South Korea A special prosecutor investigating the corruption scandal that led to President Park s impeachment summoned the de facto head of Samsung for questioning on Wednesday, calling him a bribery suspect. The de facto leader, Jay Y. Lee, the vice chairman of Samsung, will be questioned on Thursday, according to the special prosecutor's office, which recommended that he also be investigated on suspicion of perjury. Mr. Lee effectively runs Samsung, South Korea's largest conglomerate he is the son of its chairman, Lee who has been incapacitated with health problems. He is expected to be asked whether donations that Samsung made to two foundations controlled by Choi a longtime friend of the president, amounted to bribes, and what role, if any, he played in the decision to give the money. Investigators at the special prosecutor's office have questioned other senior Samsung executives as suspects about the bribery accusations. Neither Samsung nor Mr. Lee responded immediately to the announcement on Wednesday. Allegations that Ms. Park helped Ms. Choi extort millions in bribes from Samsung and other companies are at the heart of the corruption scandal that led to the National Assembly's vote to impeach her last month. Since then, Ms. Park's powers have been suspended, and she is on trial at the Constitutional Court, which will ultimately decide whether to end her presidency. Last month, Mr. Lee testified at a National Assembly hearing that he was not involved in the decision by Samsung to make the donations. He also said that the donations were not voluntary, suggesting that the company was a victim of extortion, not a participant in bribery. The reference on Wednesday to possible perjury charges against Mr. Lee stemmed from that testimony. The special prosecutor's office said it had evidence that Mr. Lee had received a request for bribery from the president and ordered Samsung subsidiaries to send bribes to destinations designated by the president. It asked the National Assembly to file a perjury complaint against Mr. Lee, which would authorize the special prosecutor to open an investigation of that charge. Asked whether investigators would seek to arrest Mr. Lee on bribery charges, a spokesman for the special prosecutor's office, Lee said, All possibilities are open. In November, state prosecutors indicted Ms. Choi on charges of coercing 53 big businesses, including Samsung, to contribute $69 million to her two foundations. They identified Ms. Park as an accomplice but stopped short of filing any charges against the businesses, all of which insisted that they were under government pressure to donate. In its impeachment bill, the National Assembly asserted that the donations were bribes, made with the expectation of political favors from the president. The special prosecutor, which took over the investigations from the state prosecutors last month, has been looking into possible bribery charges against not only Ms. Park but the businesses, particularly Samsung. Ms. Park cannot be indicted while in office. Samsung gave the largest donations to Ms. Choi's foundations, totaling $17 million. Unlike the other corporate\",\n",

It's disappointing when our partners want to pay less after we've contributed to their success, said Derek Aberle, Qualcomm's president. Now it must get out ahead of other technology inventors in 5G, possibly while paying billions in fines and dealing with a painful restructuring and fraying relationships with its biggest customers. We're not sitting still? while the problems are sorted, Mr. Aberle said. You have to invest, and invent cool stuff that will change the way people live their lives.

       "  'article': \"SEOUL, South Korea A South Korean court on Thursday blocked a prosecutor's attempt to arrest Jay Y. Lee, the leader of Samsung, saying there was not enough evidence that Mr. Lee had bribed President Park in a scandal that led to her impeachment. A justice on the Central District Court in Seoul, Cho rejected the prosecutor's request to issue an arrest warrant, saying said it was difficult to recognize the need? to incarcerate Mr. Lee. Mr. Lee, a scion and vice chairman of Samsung, one of the world's biggest conglomerates, was immediately released from a detention center outside Seoul, where he had been waiting for the court to decide whether he should be formally arrested. South Koreans have paid keen attention to the fate of Mr. Lee. Some analysts said his case was a test of whether the country's relatively youthful democracy and judicial system are ready to crack down on the crimes of conglomerates. No Samsung leader has ever been jailed, though the company has been investigated many times for corruption. The court's decision is likely to anger many South Koreans who have held weekend rallies calling for Ms. Park's ouster and the arrest of business tycoons on corruption charges. The special prosecutor called the court decision very regrettable. But he has yet to announce whether he will offer more evidence in a renewed effort to have Mr. Lee arrested. He can also indict Mr. Lee on bribery or lesser charges without arresting him. We will take necessary steps and persist in our investigation without wavering, said Lee a spokesman for the special prosecutor, without elaborating. Samsung welcomed the court's decision. For now, the ruling allows Mr. Lee to continue to lead Samsung. It dealt a blow to the special prosecutor who had tried to build a bribery case against Mr. Lee and Ms. Park. Mr. Lee's father has twice been convicted of bribery and tax evasion but has never spent a day in prison. Each time, he received a presidential pardon and returned to management. Mr. Lee, 48, was accused of paying $36 million to Ms. Park's secretive confidante, Choi . The special prosecutor and Mr. Lee's lawyers have been arguing over how to characterize the money. In November, state prosecutors indicted Ms. Choi on extortion charges, saying she leveraged her connections with Ms. Park to coerce Samsung and scores of other big businesses to contribute tens of millions of dollars to two foundations Ms. Choi controlled or to companies run by her or her associates. They identified Ms. Park as an accomplice, but they brought no charges against the businesses, which they saw as victims of extortion. But the special prosecutor, Park who took over the investigation from state prosecutors last month, has called Samsung's contributions bribes that were exchanged for political favors from Ms. Park. That includes government support for a merger of two Samsung affiliates in 2015, which helped Mr. Lee inherit corporate control from his incapacitated father, the chairman, Lee according to the prosecutor.\",\n",

Mr. Lee was the most prominent businessman to be ensnared in the special prosecutor's broadening investigation into the corruption scandal that led to Ms. Park's impeachment by Parliament last month.

Ms. Park cannot be indicted while in office. Samsung gave the largest donations to Ms. Choi's foundations, totaling $17 million. Unlike the other corporate contributors, it went beyond support for the foundations, signing an $18 million contract with a sports management company that Ms. Choi ran in Germany, to fund a program for training Korean equestrians, which mainly benefited Ms. Choi's daughter. Samsung also contributed $1. 3 million to a winter sports program for young athletes that Ms. Choi and her nephew ran. Also on Wednesday, the special prosecutor's office said it had acquired a tablet computer used by Ms. Choi that contained emails she exchanged with a Samsung executive. The emails contained information about the financial support provided by Samsung, the prosecutor's office said. The special prosecutor has been investigating whether Samsung gave its support to Ms. Choi in exchange for a decision by the National Pension Service to support a contentious merger of two Samsung affiliates in 2015.

       "  'article': \"The Wall Street lawyer Walter J. Clayton does not travel in political circles, nor is he well known in corporate America. He is the insider's insider a deal maker. As such, his nomination to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission is a strong signal that financial regulation in the Trump administration will emphasize helping companies raise capital in the public markets over tightening regulation. In contrast, the agency's two chairwomen under President Obama had regulatory or enforcement backgrounds. Mr. Clayton, known as Jay, has spent nearly his entire career in corporate boardrooms. His regulatory experience stems from advising banks on dealings with the government and helping several financial institutions with their settlements related to mortgage securities. He had a seat to the financial crisis, advising Barclays Capital in buying the assets of the bankrupt Lehman Brothers in 2008 and Bear Stearns in its fire sale to JPMorgan Chase in 2007. He has advised on mergers and initial public offerings, including the biggest ever, the $25 billion offering by Alibaba Group of China in 2013. If Mr. Clayton is confirmed, he may have to recuse himself from some matters. A similar scrutiny was applied to Mary Jo White, the agency's current chairwoman. She had been a litigator at Debevoise Plimpton, where her clients included JPMorgan Chase, Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and Kenneth D. Lewis, a former Bank of America chief executive. Still, such recusals are not unusual. Laura S. Unger, a former commissioner and acting chairwoman, said that during her tenure, she had to recuse herself from a number of matters before the commission. She said the process of deciding when to recuse oneself often took place in consultation with the commission's ethics officer. An ethics officer at the S. E. C. knows all of your intimate details, and the ethics officer flags for you what may be potential conflicts, she noted. Yet Mr. Clayton's nomination will be sure to fuel criticism that Goldman Sachs could wield too much influence in the Trump administration. Sullivan Cromwell, where Mr. Clayton is a partner, has been Goldman's law firm for more than a century. Mr. Clayton advised Goldman Sachs on perhaps its most important deal, the $5 billion investment by Warren E. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway amid the financial crisis. Mr. Clayton's wife works as a adviser at Goldman. The S. E. C. nomination follows the appointment of Goldman's No. 2 executive, Gary D. Cohn, to be the top economic policy adviser to Donald J. Trump, and the selection of a hedge fund manager who was a former Goldman trader, Steven T. Mnuchin, to be Treasury secretary. Mr. Trump's chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, is a former Goldman banker. During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump had repeatedly criticized Goldman Sachs as an emblem of a financial elite. Mr. Trump, who met with Mr. Clayton on Dec. 22, said in a statement that the lawyer will ensure our financial institutions can thrive and create jobs while playing by the rules at the same time.

       "  'article': \"SEOUL, South Korea The chief of North Korea's powerful secret police, long considered the man for the top leader, Kim has been dismissed on charges of corruption and abuse of power, the South Korean government said on Friday. The firing of the chief, Gen. Kim as minister of state security highlights the turmoil that has engulfed the upper reaches of Mr. Kim's government. The general is the latest in a series of party and military officials Mr. Kim has fired, demoted or executed as he tried to consolidate his totalitarian power through what South Korean officials and North Korean defectors have called a reign of terror. General Kim was fired in after he was demoted to a general from a one, said Jeong a spokesman for the South's Unification Ministry. The general's surprise downfall was the latest indication that even top lieutenants are at risk as Mr. Kim has rival agencies monitor one another to detect and punish any sign of disrespect or disloyalty. Until his dismissal, General Kim had been Mr. Kim's chief henchman in purging potential enemies. Kim has been a key aide to Kim and has buttressed his reign of terror, Mr. Jeong said. His dismissal could further deepen unrest among officials and add to the instability of the regime by weakening its control on the people. Mr. Jeong said General Kim was accused of corruption and held responsible for various human rights violations, including torture, committed at his agency. But other political machinations could be at play behind the dismissal, Mr. Jeong said, citing speculation about a rivalry among different power centers. Mr. Jeong noted that the dismissal resulted from an investigation by another powerful agency, the Organization and Guidance Department of the governing Workers? Party of North Korea. The department supervises all state agencies and is reportedly directly overseen by Mr. Kim. The Organization and Guidance Department is conducting an intensive investigation of Kim and the Ministry of State Security, so the level of punishment and the number of people affected could be expanded, Mr. Jeong said, without disclosing how the South Korean government learned of the reported purge transpiring inside a secretive regime. The Ministry of State Security, which serves as the secret police and intelligence agency in the North, is one of the most feared tools of government there, responsible for arresting dissidents and running a network of prison gulags. When Mr. Kim executed his own uncle and No. 2 official, Jang on charges of factionalism, corruption and plotting to overthrow his government in 2013, it was General Kim's ministry that arrested and Mr. Jang. Since taking power after the death of his father in 2011, Mr. Kim has frequently reshuffled the party and military elites as he has moved swiftly to establish his monolithic authority in North Korea, which his family has ruled for seven decades. Mr. Kim has executed at least 140 senior officials, usually killing them with machine guns and even flamethrowers, according to the Institute for National Security Strategy,\",\n",

Among them is Anne Patterson, 67, the assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs and a former ambassador to Pakistan and Egypt, two of the biggest tinderboxes Mr. Trump will face. Victoria J. Nuland, 55, one of the department's top Russia experts and former ambassador to NATO, who dealt with the Ukraine crisis, decided to retire after concluding there was probably no place for her in Mr. Trump's administration. Such a housecleaning leaves open the question of whether Mr. Tillerson, who has extensive experience abroad as chief executive of Exxon Mobil but none as a diplomat, will have the kind of help he needs in a very different kind of enterprise than negotiating on behalf of the world's largest oil company. In such an atmosphere, even seemingly routine moves like the reorganization of the National Security Council take on a political air. On Sunday, Mr. Trump's chief strategist, and chief ideologue, Stephen K. Bannon, was designated a permanent member of the principals committee? of the National Security Council, putting a political aide on par with the secretaries of state and defense. Meanwhile, the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff appeared to be downgraded, told to attend only when their issues were on the table. This is stone cold crazy, Susan E. Rice, the national security adviser until earlier this month, wrote in a Twitter post. Who needs military advice or intell to make policy on ISIL, Syria, Afghanistan, DPRK? she said, using acronyms for the Islamic State and North Korea.

Around 10 a. m. on Saturday, Mr. Chesky of Airbnb posted a vague message on Twitter saying open doors bring all of US together. By 6 p. m. he was advocating open protest. Early Sunday morning, he wrote a memo to employees warning that Mr. Trump's new policy was a direct obstacle to our mission. It was a long, dizzying day for an industry that is struggling to find its footing under the new president. It feels like the air itself has changed, like when a storm comes, said Shervin Pishevar, a founder of Sherpa Capital and Hyperloop One. Even before the executive order, pressure had been building on companies to speak out against measures being endorsed by Mr. Trump. Some of that impetus came from employees, and some from activists. Engineers and product managers at several tech companies spoke to The New York Times on the condition of anonymity. They have signed nondisclosure agreements at their companies and are generally not authorized to speak to the news media. At Twitter, a number of workers felt frustrated with the disconnect between their company's product a platform for free speech and the extent to which Mr. Trump has used it to attack those who question him and proclaim outright falsehoods to the American public. On Saturday, Jack Dorsey, Twitter's chief executive, posted and reposted numerous messages denouncing the travel ban. At Facebook, employees felt a similar sense of discord. Some complained about how long it took Mr. Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer, to speak out. Others were upset at the continued presence of Peter Thiel, a venture capitalist and a longtime confidant of Mr. Zuckerberg's, as a director on Facebook's board. Mr. Thiel was a donor to Mr. Trump?s campaign and has since become an adviser, and he issued a statement on Saturday evening that reaffirmed his support for the president. Uber is under one of the brightest spotlights. Travis Kalanick, its chief executive, is part of Mr. Trump's economic advisory team. That has made Uber a target of protesters, some of whom shut down access to its headquarters on Inauguration Day. In an email to employees on Saturday titled Standing up for what's right, Mr. Kalanick stressed the importance of pushing for change by working to have a seat at the table and discussing any differences. He said he would be seeing Mr. Trump on Friday. As protesters at Kennedy International Airport in New York multiplied on Saturday night, cabdrivers largely immigrants began a work stoppage at the airport as a form of protest against the executive order.

       "  'article': \"Vincent Viola, a billionaire Wall Street trader and President Trump's nominee for secretary of the Army, abruptly withdrew his name for the post on Friday night after concluding it would be too difficult to untangle himself from his business ties, two government officials said. Mr. Viola is an owner of the Florida Panthers hockey club and a majority shareholder in Virtu Financial and Eastern Air Lines, among a number of other business interests. This week The New York Times reported that Mr. Viola had been negotiating to swap his stake in Eastern Air Lines for a stake in Swift Air, an airline with government subcontracts. If his nomination had continued, he would have faced certain scrutiny for potentially becoming a government official who benefits from federal contracts. The Trump administration did not announce his withdrawal, which was reported earlier on Friday by Bloomberg News, but a senior administration official and a Pentagon official separately confirmed his decision, which the White House accepted Friday. Both officials spoke on the condition of anonymity. Mr. Viola is a 1977 graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point, and he last served in the Army Reserves at the rank of major. He remained connected to the military through donations to West Point, including to the academy's Combating Terrorism Center. A former Pentagon official and close friend said Mr. Viola was devastated over having to withdraw from what he described as a lifelong dream job. But the former official said Mr. Viola felt he was unable to sell his interest in some of his holdings because doing so could have destroyed those companies. His decision followed weeks of negotiations between his lawyers and the government as they sought to find a solution. Ultimately, they could not. Mr. Viola has a net worth of almost $1. 8 billion and is a of Virtu. Virtu had planned to go public in 2014, but pulled the plug on the move because of choppy markets and lingering questions around how trading firms like Virtu make money. In a regulatory filing at the time, Virtu said regulators were looking into its trading practices. It is not known if this issue played a role in Mr. Viola's decision to withdraw his name for the Army secretary job, which is a post that requires Senate confirmation. His decision to withdraw comes the same week another of Mr. Trump's appointees, Anthony Scaramucci, was told he would not get a top job at the White House amid concerns about the recent sale of his company to a large Chinese conglomerate. In an episode unrelated to the finances of Mr. Viola, it was recently revealed that he was involved in an altercation in August: He was accused of punching a concessions worker at a racehorse auction in Saratoga Springs, N. Y. No charges were brought against him. Mr. Viola was one of the first nominations Mr. Trump issued the day he was inaugurated.

The decision to oust Mr. Christie's team, without quickly putting in place a new one, left the administration, which must still fill hundreds of top jobs, ill prepared for the nomination process. The vetting process is designed to identify issues about fitness and confirmability prior to public announcement, said Leslie B. Kiernan, a former deputy White House counsel for President Obama and now a partner with the law firm Akin Gump. The confirmation hearing for Mr. Puzder, the billionaire restaurant to head the Labor Department, was postponed several times because of a delay in filing his financial disclosure statement. Mr. Puzder's hearing is now scheduled for Thursday after the ethics office on Wednesday cleared his financial disclosure statement and ethics agreement. In the agreement, Mr. Puzder said that if confirmed, he would divest himself of his holdings in CKE Restaurants, the operator of the Hardee's and Carl's Jr. chains that he heads. Todd Ricketts, the deputy commerce secretary nominee, has not had a confirmation hearing yet, even though he was announced by the Trump team on Nov. 30. Mr. Ricketts is the scion of a wealthy family and of the Chicago Cubs. A letter on Feb. 7 to Mr. Ricketts by several Democratic senators asked him for more information about his political activity. Despite the setbacks for Mr. Trump, the administration has had ample resources at its disposal. One bipartisan program, called the Center for Presidential Transition, met with the remaining campaigns in the spring to offer advice on a process it calls big, complicated and dangerous. In the months before the election, the Office of Government Ethics also communicated with representatives for Mr. Trump. After his victory, the office offered to bring over supplies, including regulatory books and ethics guides, according to internal emails made public by the agency in response to records requests. But with the turnover at the Trump transition team in the wake of the election, the communication with the agency stopped. Walter M. Shaub Jr. director of the office, cautioned in a Nov. 18 email that cabinet nominees who did not make use of the office for prescreening posed the risk of embarrassment for the and his appointees. Mr. Shaub wrote in one email, We seem to have lost contact with the transition since the election. The messy start to the ethics process could still come back to haunt the administration. In 2000, when Mr. Bush faced a condensed timeline after the contested election in Florida, his team moved aggressively to minimize potential surprises, said Mr. Johnson, who was executive director of the transition.

Mr. Lynton, who weathered various corporate crises at Sony Entertainment over his tenure, including a devastating cyberattack and a battle with activist investors, will step down on Feb. 2, the company said. After that, Kazuo Hirai, the president and chief executive of Sony Corporation, based in Tokyo, will take a more role at the conglomerate's movie, television and music division, at least for a time. Mr. Hirai will begin keeping a second office at Sony's studio complex in Culver City, Calif. the company said, and take the additional title of executive of Sony Entertainment. Mr. Lynton will also serve as executive for a period starting in February to help Mr. Hirai learn the inner workings of the movie and television businesses and select a permanent successor. In the meantime, Mr. Lynton, 57, will officially become chairman of the board at Snap Inc. which owns Snapchat. Snap is expected to go public with an eye toward being valued at $30 billion or more this spring. As chairman, Mr. Lynton is not expected to play a direct management role, but rather focus on matters involving strategy and governance in support of Evan Spiegel, Snap's chief executive.
