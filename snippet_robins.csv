"Who is the author of the memoir ""Nicotine""?",1,17552,"The best cigarette you will ever smoke, Gregor Hens writes in his new memoir, Nicotine, is the relapse cigarette. It tastes better, he adds, the longer the prior abstinence. This is dangerous knowledge. More than a few smokers relapsed after Sept. 11. Others did after the recent presidential election, as if heeding the poet James Dickey's dictum that guilt is magical. Some of us barely keep the urge at bay. There's a dark sliver in a former smoker's mind that for dire events, so as to justify lighting up again. But it's not as if we need large cues, Mr. Hens writes, when small ones will do. Every form of cigarette ad gives me a pang of longing, every carelessly cigarette packet at a bus stop, every cigarette butt, every beautiful woman holding a cigarette between her fingers or just looking like she could be holding one, he writes. My reading chair in Columbus gives me a pang, and M. s balcony in Berlin, and my old Jeep because I've smoked some of the best cigarettes while driving. Mr. Hens is a German writer and translator who has lived and taught in the United States. Nicotine? is the first of his own books to be issued in English. It's a hybrid volume: part memoir, part philosophical lament. It doesn't always click. There are passages (?I saw myself as a part of a field of tension?) that, in this translation by Jen Calleja, veer close to psychobabble. But when Nicotine? stays dry, earthy and combustible, like a Virginia tobacco blend, it has a lot to say and says it well. The author does not resemble your idea of a former serious smoker. There Mr. Hens is, and dimpled, in his author photo on the back flap. He looks as if he were ready to bag organic carrots during his weekend stint at the food . Indeed, he writes, he is a serious cyclist, a participant in triathlons and a member of the German Alpine Association. He's been a health nut all along, at least in between long bouts of smoking. I can't decide if this is suspicious or insane, like that famous photograph of the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Len Dawson, taking a deep drag on a cigarette in the locker room during halftime of Super Bowl I in 1967. I've smoked well over a hundred thousand cigarettes in my life, and each one of those cigarettes meant something to me, Mr. Hens writes. He goes on: I've smoked cold cigarette butts, cigars, cigarillos, bidis, kreteks, spliffs and straw. I've missed flights because of cigarettes and burnt holes in trousers and car seats. I've singed my eyelashes and eyebrows, fallen asleep while smoking and dreamt of cigarettes of relapses and fires and bitter withdrawal. He sees this book as a chance finally to put the urge behind him, to comprehend it, seal it and bury it. He writes about his childhood.

"Who is the author of the memoir ""Nicotine""?",2,17689,"American novelists have long complained about the ability of real life to outstrip fiction. In his landmark 1961 essay Writing American Fiction, Philip Roth observed that actuality is continually outdoing our talents, and the culture tosses up figures almost daily that are the envy of any novelist. The figure Roth cites is Charles Van Doren, of scandal fame but place Mr. Van Doren next to Donald J. Trump, and you can measure the change in the nature of credibility over the past . Mr. Van Doren was disgraced when it was revealed that he had been given the answers to the questions on the game show ? a contest that television viewers believed was real, not staged. Today an entire flourishing genre of television goes by the name reality, yet no one who watches it thinks it is genuinely real that is, unplanned and unedited. Artificiality is what makes reality television enjoyable, even though these same shows, if advertised as fiction, would appear banal, repetitive and undramatic. Reality is the ingredient that turns a bad fiction into an enthralling one. This dynamic is part of the novel's origins. The earliest English novels, from Moll Flanders? (1722) to Clarissa? (1748) were published anonymously, with titles that implied they were true stories. It took generations to establish the conventions of fiction sufficiently to allow readers to take pleasure in novels that were explicitly untrue. The suspension of disbelief that fiction involves is a late stage in the evolution of taste, and it may prove to have been a temporary one. The rise of the memoir over the past few decades doesn't mean that readers are ready to abandon the techniques of fiction but, like readers three centuries ago, they want the freedom of fiction along with consequentiality of fact. The author David Shields diagnosed this desire in his 2010 manifesto Reality Hunger?: I find it very nearly impossible to read a contemporary novel that presents itself as a novel. Many fiction writers share this intuition, though they respond to it in different ways. One way is to make the novel by turning its imitation of reality into an exaggeration, a mirror. Has our reality since felt apocalyptic? Then imagine Manhattan being destroyed by zombies (Colson Whitehead's Zone One?) or a flood (Nathaniel Rich's Odds Against Tomorrow?) or civil war and foreign bankers (Gary Shteyngart's Super Sad True Love Story?). Because we know such things could never happen, they mark the story as fiction because we know similar things have happened and will happen, they become truthful fictions. An alternative approach is to make fiction as close to fact as possible, by reducing its scope to the one subject on which each writer is an unchallengeable authority: himself or herself. Ben Lerner's 10:04, Tao Lin's Taipei? and Sheila Heti's How Should a Person Be? all seek to convince us that we are reading about the writer's actual life. These writers are engaged in a sophisticated project, in which the line between truth and",0.4678330421447754,"{'score': 0.4678330421447754, 'start': 325, 'end': 342, 'answer': 'Charles Van Doren'}",Charles Van Doren,325,342,"The figure Roth cites is Charles Van Doren, of scandal fame but place"
"Who is the author of the memoir ""Nicotine""?",3,17552,"while smoking and dreamt of cigarettes of relapses and fires and bitter withdrawal. He sees this book as a chance finally to put the urge behind him, to comprehend it, seal it and bury it. He writes about his childhood. His father smoked so much that the author thought smoking was the older man's job. His mother, a stylish woman who drove a Range Rover, smoked more when she was depressed. There's a faded romance in the European brand names of the cigarettes he or his family members smoked: Finas Kyriazi Fr'res Kims Murattis filterless Senior Services Erntes Van Nelle Halfzwares. This book takes us to unusual and evocative locations, too, such as the Frisian island of Borkum. Mr. Hens recounts a drive to the German city of Balderschwang, which sounds like a word an American politician would utter when something livelier than poppycock? was required. He is especially good on how those who quit become vicarious smokers. Sometimes I walk around the city and imagine that others are smoking on my behalf, he writes. I silently thank the smokers in front of the cafes and office buildings and in smoking areas, imagining that they do it for me, for my inner contentment. I have people smoke for me. Like any author worth reading, Mr. Hens is sometimes best when he goes dispatching obiter dicta. He is brutal about the Midwest. (?The most insignificant city in the United States is Columbus, Ohio. ) He's interesting about aphorisms and our need to attach them, usually erroneously, to famous people. He considers how often we utter the phrase no worries? when, in fact, we are murderously aggrieved. He charts the passing of time by noting how the white tennis balls of his youth have become neon green. This book is not a deep dive into smoking and literature, or into smoking and films. He doesn't go out of his way to conjure the romance of two lit cigarettes and a corner table. Nicotine? mostly omits the social pleasures of smoking. Mr. Hens is, with a metaphorical carton of American Spirits under his arm, a smoking section of one. His lapidary prose will sometimes put you in mind of the Norwegian writer Karl Ove Knausgaard's, though Mr. Knausgaard is generally more penetrating. The small photographs in Nicotine? recall the images in some of W. G. Sebald's books. This edition of Nicotine? includes an introduction by the English writer Will Self that belongs in the hall of fame of bad introductions. Mr. Self (never has his name seemed so apt) tries to Mr. Hens by bragging at length about his own peerless nicotine addiction. This introduction is profitably torn out, the way smokers of unfiltered cigarettes tear the filters from Marlboros. This seems like the place to mention that Mr. Hens compares the cottony insides of a cigarette filter, perfectly, to artichoke hair. Someday, surely, smoking will be outlawed. Who will smoke the last unfiltered Camel?

What skills are inmates learning in the innovative program at Lecce Penitentiary?,1,17382,"LECCE, Italy One of his first students was a young man he had arrested four years earlier. Others have been convicted of armed robbery, drug trafficking and criminal association with the mafia. The classrooms are frugally equipped, behind windows protected by vertical and horizontal bars, although one has brightly colored paintings covering the walls. But none of that deterred Marco Albanese, a police officer for 19 years and a trained sommelier for five, from teaching a class of rapt students the finer points of deconstructing the bouquet of a chardonnay or pouring a rare vintage. Mr. Albanese, 43, is an instructor in an innovative effort at Lecce Penitentiary to teach inmates to be sommeliers, or wine stewards. The courses are part of a program to teach prisoners new professional skills, as well as to help them develop a bond with the region, which is renowned for its negroamaro grapes. The program has been enthusiastically embraced by the prisoner students, who were tasting white wines on a recent afternoon. It has also been an eye opener for Mr. Albanese. I could see their human aspect, once they were out of their context, Mr. Albanese, who traded in his police uniform for the crisp blue jacket and tie of a sommelier for the class. And I didn't have to keep the same distance, now that I was their professor. ? He added, They also deserve a second chance, and it's important that they know that the institutions do believe that they can be educated to a different life. In eight lessons, the group of 30 men and women, who are instructed in separate classes, learn how to taste, choose and serve local wines. We hope to teach them the social value of work and the preciousness of their own territory, so that they can later choose to work here, already having the right skill set, said Rita Russo, the director of Lecce Penitentiary, which is the largest in the region of Apulia. Inmates can also study for their high school diplomas, cultivate tomatoes, take theater classes and learn to be painters or tailors. Class begins with a slide show on the history of wine, explaining how it was drunk by the ancient Greeks and introducing the students to the Roman ancestors of modern sommeliers in Italy. On a school table, covered with a khaki tablecloth, stood wine glasses, ready for use. Three bottles of chardonnay, a red primitivo and a negroamaro stood on a table nearby. Mr. Albanese then addressed the prisoners, who sat facing him on stools listing the temperatures at which different wines should be served and how to store them in cellars. For a finale, he offered a tip. Do remember, even if you had Trump over for dinner, the pope would still be served first.

The prisoners, whose identity is being protected by the prison, were not allowed to be interviewed or photographed for this article. Roberto Giannone, who works for the local sommelier association, then demonstrated how to open a bottle, neatly slicing off the capsule covering the bottleneck in three cuts, inserting the corkscrew and smoothly pulling out the cork. Once the cork is out, he said, use a napkin to show it to your customers. It's an easy way to be polite and avoid objections. Since the 1970s, the Italian penal system has focused on for inmates. However, a lack of funds for rehabilitation, as well as chronic overcrowding, means that thousands of incarcerated men and women have little to do all day. That has sparked some innovative rehabilitation programs, including a restaurant inside a prison near Milan in which the waiters and cooks are inmates. But the sommelier class at the Lecce prison is believed to be unique in Italy. Of course, sommelier courses can't be considered a treatment, said Georgia Zara, the head of a program at the University of Turin that offers a master's degree in criminological and forensic psychology. But they do educate inmates and create social interaction, which is very important. The classes also offer a bridge between the jail context and the world outside, so it's a small investment to reduce the risk of recidivism, Ms. Zara said. Gianvito Rizzo, 53, is the chief executive at the Feudi di Guagnano, a local vintner that provides wine, like negroamaro, for the classes. He is also the creator of the sommelier classes at the prison. Mr. Rizzo has proposed that inmates start working on his nearly 75 acres of vines in the coming year under certain circumstances, some inmates in Italy are allowed to work outside prisons. I see wine in a democratic way, Mr. Rizzo said as he walked through his vineyard recently. The countryside is the opposite to a cell. You are free. You smell nature, and learn to care for it. I think it'd be good also for inmates to try it out. Mr. Rizzo said that when he had received a master's degree from the Bocconi University business school in Milan three decades ago, he had been fixated? on doing something for his native region of Salento, in Apulia, on the heel of the Italian boot. He settled on going into the wine business, which had been struggling to convert farmers who cultivated for personal or local use into becoming larger producers. He now produces 16 different wines from grapes grown in vineyards that he and two friends and business partners inherited from their fathers, added to those that other friends asked them to cultivate on their behalf.

What skills are inmates learning in the innovative program at Lecce Penitentiary?,3,18428,"WASHINGTON As the Central Intelligence Agency was setting up its secret prisons overseas 15 years ago to interrogate terrorism suspects, a Defense Department unit was considering a proposal to establish a secret military prison abroad, according to previously undisclosed government documents. The proposal was presented in a 2002 memo written in part by Bruce Jessen, one of two psychologists who eventually helped create the C. I. A. s enhanced interrogation? program. The memo, obtained by The New York Times, recommended opening at least one secret overseas site where prisoners would be subjected to constant sensory deprivation? and develop a profound sense of despair. The military, though, did not act on the proposal for an undisclosed . S. unsuspected, secure location? to hold, manage and exploit detainees. The Department of Defense, through a spokeswoman, declined to comment on the extent to which the plan, which originated in the military's Joint Personnel Recovery Agency, was considered. Aside from sensory deprivation, the memo suggested that additional pressure tactics be permitted against prisoners, including those that maximize cultural undesirability, but it did not mention the brutal physical coercion techniques, such as waterboarding, later approved for use in the C. I. A. prisons. The memo is included among several government documents provided during the discovery process in a lawsuit brought in federal court in Spokane, Wash. against Dr. Jessen and the other psychologist, James E. Mitchell, by two former C. I. A. prisoners and the representative of a third man, who died in custody. The documents, along with others previously released, are helping to fill in gaps in the historical record about the interrogation program of the George W. Bush era. Their disclosure comes soon after the Trump administration drafted an executive order calling for reviving the C. I. A. black site? prisons, though the White House has since appeared to back off from the idea after lawmakers and cabinet officials objected. Also disclosed in the lawsuit were a series of PowerPoint training slides for American personnel apparently headed to the military detention center at Guantnamo Bay, Cuba, discussing how they could defeat efforts by terrorism suspects to resist questioning. Those slides or a similar set were used in a training course by Dr. Jessen and a colleague in March 2002, and excerpted in a 2008 Senate Armed Services Committee report. Among the potential methods listed are psychological torture? through isolation, threats against self or family? and the use of drugs. When Dr. Jessen's memo was written in April 2002, he was the chief psychologist at the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency, a Defense Department unit overseeing training programs in which military personnel are subjected to simulated torture tactics and mock interrogation to prepare them for possible capture by regimes violating the laws of war. Dr. Jessen and most of his colleagues had no experience in conducting actual interrogations, but the Department of Defense legal counsel sought information from the agency on detainee exploitation? beginning in late 2001.

Zachary Cole Fernandez, a artist, surrendered on Monday with his lawyer at his side, according to the Los Angeles Police Department. He was booked on a misdemeanor trespassing charge and released on bail. The sign was changed about 3 a. m. on Jan. 1, when two O's were partly obscured by sheets and turned into E's. It remained that way throughout the morning before the sign was restored. In a phone interview, Mr. Fernandez said he considered the results more of an art installation than a prank. Yeah, I broke the rules, but I broke it with good spirit and good intentions, he said on Tuesday. It was just to bring light and positivity and happiness. But David Ryu, a Los Angeles councilman, remained unamused. Pranks of this nature deplete the resources of our valuable public safety personnel, in both responding to the prank and in responding to the increased crowds and copycat attempts that these incidents generate, he said in a statement on Monday. My office has urged the city attorney and L. A. P. D. to investigate and prosecute this case, as well as all attempts to trespass near, alter, or vandalize the sign. Mr. Fernandez is expected to appear in court on Feb. 15. He said he had been inspired by a similar alteration in 1976, and that he had used clamps and sheets so as not to damage the sign.

"Who surrendered to the authorities for changing the Hollywood sign to ""Hollyweed""?",2,17663,"Monges, who had been working in Venezuela, said in a phone interview. I am stranded here in this country. The number of Cubans leaving for America has surged since the two governments resumed relations in late 2014, in expectation that the policy known as wet foot, dry foot? because those caught at sea were sent back but those who made it to dry land were allowed to stay might end. A senior official with the Department of Homeland Security, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in keeping with agency policy, said the administration decided to end the program immediately to prevent a mass exodus that would risk lives at land and sea. In Cuba, the abrupt change seemed to further divide people along generational lines. Many older Cubans said the decision was a just one that would halt the steady drain of the nation's citizens especially educated ones like doctors to America. One man, selling copies of the newspaper Granma on the street, said the measure was necessary to stop undermining the Cuban government? by enticing people to throw their fates to the sea. But younger Cubans, for whom the prospect of a life in America offers a glimmer of hope amid economic hardship, were crushed, forced to envision a future with fewer options. Cuban identity, and pride, is in no small part forged by its relationship with the United States, both in the tiny country's defiance of its bigger neighbor and then in the unique privileges afforded to those who fled and made it to America. To be suddenly placed on equal footing with the millions of others around the world hoping to do the same was an especially hard fall. In Havana, where until recently the internet has been out of reach for most ordinary Cubans, the city's relatively new parks have become stations of despair following the announcement. For a nation robbed of connectivity for more than a decade, the sudden surge of digital news through email, messaging and social media seemed like a particularly cruel way to find out their special treatment had ended. A few blocks from the American Embassy, in the neighborhood of Vedado, the casual atmosphere changed suddenly as the news began to spread. Visitors checking their phones shared the news with those within shouting distance. One youth yelled to the gathered crowds: Have you heard? This screws up all your lives. Miguel Alberto Escalona, 24, sat with his wife in a park in Vedado, bewildered. He sent a text to his family in Miami decrying the change. The news also brought to the surface frustrations for young Cubans, especially concerning the new dynamic that an increase in tourism is bringing to the nation. Food prices have surged to meet the demand, while what scant resources the country are redirected to the outsiders now flooding Cuba, especially Americans.

It was on this day in 1968 that Johnny Cash played his At Folsom Prison? concert. The event was meant to revive Mr. Cash's career, which had flagged since the 1950s thanks to an amphetamine habit. Executives at Mr. Cash's record label, Columbia Records, saw him as so unreliable that they kept the planning of the Folsom show a secret from the press, said Robert Hilburn, author of Johnny Cash: The Life. They weren't certain he would show. Thankfully, he did. And he was incredible. It was like he sensed this was a moment, said Mr. Hilburn, who himself attended the concert after hearing about it from a disc jockey. Mr. Cash tailored his song choices along themes of longing, sin and misfortune, including, of course, his 1955 hit Folsom Prison Blues. Assembled in the heavily guarded Dining Room 2, the inmates couldn't get enough. You could just sense their spirit rising, said Mr. Hilburn. It was just electrifying. The band actually performed twice, in the morning and afternoon, to ensure a good recording. At Folsom Prison? drew largely from the first show and was released four months later. It was a huge success and kicked off a resurgence in Mr. Cash's popularity. A year later, he did another prison record, At San Quentin, which was also successful.

The Crest archive represents a major document dump, but the C. I. A. has published many other declassified files online. Its files are typically unclassified after 25 years.

I have plenty of colleagues who say, Leave me alone in my lab,? said Jonathan Overpeck, director of the Institute for the Environment at the University of Arizona. Still, he has seen more scientists take at least the first steps toward mobilization. Right now it's mostly talking about what to do, he said. We're scientists we tend to plan very carefully what we do and then we try to do it well. But certainly there's an elevated sense that this is very real. That sense has motivated hundreds of student and faculty volunteers at nearly a dozen universities to participate in data rescue? events over the last two months, the most recent of which was held this weekend at New York University. After a brief training session, participants spent six hours archiving environmental data from government websites, including those of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Interior Department. An anonymous donor has provided storage on Amazon servers, and the information can be searched from a website at the University of Pennsylvania called Data Refuge. Though the Federal Records Act theoretically protects government data from deletion, scientists who rely on it say would rather be safe than sorry. For a problem like climate change, you can't understand it if you don't have data, said Jerome Whitington, an environmental anthropologist and member of the group Environmental Data Governance Initiative, which sponsored the N. Y. U. event. Much of the concern among scientists has been centered on the E. P. A. which was a favorite target of Mr. Trump during the campaign. Comments by members of his transition team have led to speculation that the new administration would gut the agency's science staff. Although he said he was speaking only for himself, Myron Ebell, who headed the E. P.

I'm a great believer in science, Mr. Ebell said, but I'm not a great believer in politicized science. Many scientists would argue that it is climate deniers and others who are politicized. The question of whether scientists should take sides politically is an old one, with the widespread and view among many researchers that they should be quiet and let their data speak for itself. Some scientists have objected to plans for the Washington march, arguing that the event will feed the view among many conservatives that scientists have a political agenda.

Mr. Pai took a first swipe at net neutrality rules designed to ensure equal access to content on the internet. He stopped nine companies from providing discounted internet service to individuals. He withdrew an effort to keep prison phone rates down, and he scrapped a proposal to break open the cable box market. In total, as the chairman of the F. C. C. Mr. Pai released about a dozen actions in the last week, many buried in the agency's website and not publicly announced, stunning consumer advocacy groups and telecom analysts. They said Mr. Pai's message was clear: The F. C. C. an independent agency, will mirror the Trump administration's rapid unwinding of government regulations that businesses fought against during the Obama administration. With these tactics, Chairman Pai is showing his true stripes, said Matt Wood, the policy director at the consumer group Free Press. The public wants an F. C. C. that helps people, he added. Instead, it got one that does favors for the powerful corporations that its chairman used to work for. Mr. Pai, a former lawyer for Verizon, was elevated by Mr. Trump to the position of chairman after serving as a minority Republican member for the past three years. Known for being a stickler on conservative interpretations of telecommunications law and the limits of the F. C. C. s authority, Mr. Pai said he was trying to wipe the slate clean. He noted that his predecessor, Tom Wheeler, had rammed through a series of actions right after the presidential election. Many of those efforts, Mr. Pai argued, went beyond the agency's legal authority. These actions, which did not enjoy the support of the majority of commissioners at the time they were taken, should not bind us going forward, Mr. Pai said in a statement released Friday. Accordingly, they are being revoked. The efforts portend great changes at the federal agency at the center of the convergence of media, telecommunications and the internet. The biggest target will be net neutrality, a rule created in 2015 that prevents internet service providers from blocking or discriminating against internet traffic. The rule, which was created alongside a decision to categorize broadband like a utility, was the tech centerpiece of the Obama administration. On Friday, the F. C. C. took its first steps to pull back those rules, analysts said. Mr. Pai closed an investigation into practices of the wireless providers ATT and Verizon. is the offering of free streaming and other downloads that do not count against limits on the amount of data a consumer can download. If a provider like ATT offers free streaming of its DirecTV programs, does that violate net neutrality rules because it could put competing video services at a disadvantage?

Which leader of the fringe movement embracing white nationalism was punched in the face during the protests in Washington?,1,17841,"WASHINGTON A spate of violence erupted on Friday in the nation's capital, as protesters damaged storefronts, threw rocks and bricks at police officers and lit a limousine on fire. Phalanxes of police officers used pepper spray, flash grenades and other nonlethal tools to disperse the protesters. By the end of the day, six police officers had sustained minor injuries and more than 200 people had been arrested. Many of the protesters were dressed in black, wore face masks and carried flags associated with groups. They congregated on a series of streets just blocks from the parade where Donald J. Trump passed as he made his way to the White House for the first time as president, their activities creating a distraction as television networks played live footage of the clashes. The violence was focused not only on the police. Richard B. Spencer, a leader of the a fringe movement that embraces white nationalism and a range of racist and positions, was punched in the face by a protester as Mr. Spencer gave an interview on the street, according to a video posted on Twitter. We're not peaceful, said one of the masked protesters who, like many others who clashed with the police, ran away after being approached by reporters. While the clashes occurred, thousands of peaceful protesters marched across the country as they voiced slogans. In New York, seven people were arrested when they blocked the sidewalk outside Trump Tower. Protesters in San Francisco formed a blockade across train tracks, leading to eight arrests, and chained themselves to the downtown offices of Uber and Wells Fargo. In the central business district of Portland, Ore. banks, clothing retailers and a jewelry store boarded up windows and covered walls to limit vandalism. Chants in English and Spanish broke out in front of the Capitol in Phoenix. This is one of the darkest days in the history of our country, said Adelle Wallace, 75, during a march in Los Angeles. The violence in Washington began about an hour before Mr. Trump was sworn in at noon. Storefront windows at a Bank of America and a Starbucks several blocks from the parade route were smashed, leading to many arrests. Around 2 p. m. as Mr. Trump ate lunch on Capitol Hill with lawmakers and supporters, the protests expanded and turned violent. Protesters hurled rocks and bricks at police officers several blocks from the parade route. Officers with helmets and riot shields tried to disperse the protesters by using flash grenades and pepper spray. After being pushed back a block, protesters outside the Washington Post building lit a fire in the middle of the street, smashed the windows of a limousine and then lit it on fire. The police, using more flash grenades, cleared a path for fire trucks as protesters retreated to a park. The violence attracted a throng of onlookers, journalists and peaceful protesters who had marched earlier in the day.

Which leader of the fringe movement embracing white nationalism was punched in the face during the protests in Washington?,2,18254,"The videotaped sucker punch that staggered the white nationalist Richard Spencer on Inauguration Day quickly inspired mockery on social media. But it echoed loudly in an escalating confrontation between extreme ends of the political spectrum. With groups edging into the mainstream with the rise of President Trump, and anarchists are vowing to confront them at every turn, and by any means necessary including violence. In Berkeley, Calif. on Wednesday night, masked protesters set fires, smashed windows and stormed buildings on the campus of the University of California to shut down a speech by Milo Yiannopoulos, an inflammatory Breitbart News editor and a provocateur already barred from Twitter. Five people were injured, administrators canceled the event, and the university police locked down the campus for hours. That followed a bloody melee in Seattle on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, when demonstrators their faces concealed to minimize the risk of arrest tried to prevent a speech by Mr. Yiannopoulos at the University of Washington, and a was shot and seriously wounded by a supporter of Mr. Yiannopoulos. The outbreaks of destruction and violence since Mr. Trump's inauguration have earned contempt from Republicans including Trump supporters who say it is exactly why they voted for his promises of law and order and condemnation from Democrats like Berkeley's mayor, Jesse Arregun. He called Wednesday's display contrary to progressive values? and said it provided the ultranationalist far right exactly the images they want? to try to discredit peaceful protesters of Mr. Trump's policies. But anarchists and who often make up a small but disproportionately portion of protesters, defend the mayhem they create as a necessary response to an emergency. Yes, what the black bloc did last night was destructive to property, Eric Laursen, a writer in Massachusetts who has helped publicize anarchist protests, said, using another name for the demonstrators. But do you just let someone like Milo go wherever he wants and spread his hate? That kind of argument can devolve into just sit on your hands and wait for it to pass.? And it doesn't. Anarchists also say their recent efforts have been wildly successful, both by focusing attention on their most urgent argument that Mr. Trump poses a fascist threat and by enticing others to join their movement. The number of people who have been showing up to meetings, the number of meetings, and the number of plans for future actions is through the roof, Legba Carrefour, who helped organize the Disrupt J20 protests on Inauguration Day in Washington, said in an interview. Gained 1, 000 followers in the last week, trumpeted @NYCAntifa, an Twitter account in New York, on Jan. 24. Pretty crazy for us as we've been active for many years with minimal attention.

We need to sit down and talk about what is acceptable, she added. Troy Worden, a student and a member of the College Republicans, said he would absolutely? invite Mr. Yiannopoulos to speak on campus again, and Mr. Tahmas added that the Republican student group is a racially diverse group that does not consider Mr. Yiannopoulos to be a white nationalist. Criticism of the decision to cancel the speech came from outside the university as well. On Twitter early on Thursday, President Trump went as far as to threaten withholding federal funds from the university for failing to stop violence on people with a different point of view. Mr. Yiannopoulos has cultivated a sizable following among the movement with his speaking events, podcast interviews and articles. He travels around California on a tour bus airbrushed with his likeness. Since embarking in September on his speaking tour of American campuses, he has been trailed by protests. But the events have also attracted pockets of anarchists clad in face masks and spoiling for a fight. Some university organizers withdrew invitations to Mr. Yiannopoulos over security concerns. At the University of California, Davis, on Jan. 13, his speech was canceled as it was set to begin after a tense standoff between protesters and police officers. A week later, on Inauguration Day, a man was shot during protests outside Mr. Yiannopoulos's speech at the University of Washington in Seattle. He was to cap his tour this week at Berkeley. In the weeks leading up to the event, campus administrators faced tremendous pressure from student groups and faculty members to cancel it. In a video of himself posted on Facebook after the cancellation on Wednesday night, Mr. Yiannopoulos criticized the hard left, which has become so utterly antithetical to free speech in the last few years. They simply will not allow any speaker on campus, even somebody as silly and harmless and gay as me to have their voice heard, he added. One group that has been outspoken in favor of allowing Mr. Yiannopoulos to speak is the veterans of the university's free speech movement. I'm really a little fatigued with all of this, Oh my goodness, cover my ears, someone will say something that will upset me, I can't tolerate that, said Jack Radey, who was a activist during the original free speech movement at Berkeley. There are racists, sexists, piggery of various kinds who will say really terrible things. And that is part of the world, Mr. Radey said by telephone from Oregon, where he is retired. Learn how to fight back. Don't say, Oh, no. We can't allow someone to speak because someone might be offended.? In a letter to The Daily Californian, Berkeley's student newspaper, Mr. Radey and other members of the Free Speech Movement Archive board of directors, a grouping of some of the movement's activists, said Mr. Yiannopoulos was a bigot who comes to campus spouting vitriol so as to attract attention to himself.

"Who narrated the documentary ""I Am Not Your Negro""?",1,18228,"A few weeks ago, in reaction to something we had written about blackness and whiteness in recent movies, my colleague Manohla Dargis and I received a note from a reader. Since when is everything about race? he wanted to know. Perhaps it was a rhetorical question. A flippant though by no means inaccurate answer would have been 1619. But a more constructive response might have been to recommend Raoul Peck's new documentary, I Am Not Your Negro. Let me do so now, for that reader (if he's still interested) and for everybody else, too. Whatever you think about the past and future of what used to be called race relations? white supremacy and the resistance to it, in plainer English this movie will make you think again, and may even change your mind. Though its principal figure, the novelist, playwright and essayist James Baldwin, is a man who has been dead for nearly 30 years, you would be to find a movie that speaks to the present moment with greater clarity and force, insisting on uncomfortable truths and drawing stark lessons from the shadows of history. To call I Am Not Your Negro? a movie about James Baldwin would be to understate Mr. Peck's achievement. It's more of a posthumous collaboration, an uncanny and thrilling communion between the filmmaker whose previous work includes both a documentary and a narrative feature about the Congolese leader Patrice Lumumba and his subject. The narration (read by Samuel L. Jackson) is entirely drawn from Baldwin's work. Much of it comes from notes and letters written in the when Baldwin was somewhat reluctantly sketching out a book, never to be completed, about the lives and deaths of Medgar Evers, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. Reflections on those men (all of whom Baldwin knew well) and their legacies are interspersed with passages from other books and essays, notably The Devil Finds Work, Baldwin's 1976 meditation on race, Hollywood and the mythology of white innocence. His published and unpublished words some of the most powerful and penetrating ever assembled on the tortured subject of American identity accompany images from old talk shows and news reports, from classic movies and from our own decidedly present. Baldwin could not have known about Ferguson and Black Lives Matter, about the presidency of Barack Obama and the recrudescence of white nationalism in its wake, but in a sense he explained it all in advance. He understood the deep, contradictory patterns of our history, and articulated, with a passion and clarity that few others have matched, the psychological dimensions of racial conflict: the suppression of black humanity under slavery and Jim Crow and the insistence on it in politics and art the dialectic of guilt and rage, forgiveness and denial that distorts relations between black and white citizens in the North as well as the South the lengths that white people will go to wash themselves clean of their complicity in oppression.

"Who narrated the documentary ""I Am Not Your Negro""?",2,18228,"his scorn, the weight of his disappointment, the gift of his trust. Recounting his visits to the South, where he reported on the civil rights movement and the murderous white response to it, Baldwin modestly described himself as a witness, a watchful presence on the sidelines of tragedy and heroism, an outsider by virtue of his Northern origins, his sexuality and his alienation from the Christianity of his childhood. But he was also a prophet, able to see the truths revealed by the contingent, complicated actions of ordinary people on both sides of the conflict. This is not to say that he transcended the struggle or detached himself from it. On the contrary, he demonstrated that writing well and thinking clearly are manifestations of commitment, and that irony, skepticism and a ruthless critical spirit are necessary tools for effective moral and political action. I Am Not Your Negro? is a thrilling introduction to his work, a remedial course in American history, and an advanced seminar in racial politics a concise, roughly movie with the scope and impact of a or a literary doorstop.

Who is the billionaire restaurant owner nominated to head the Labor Department?,1,18364,"WASHINGTON Andrew F. Puzder, who as President Trump's pick to head the Labor Department has come under fire for criticizing worker protections, acknowledged on Monday that he had employed an undocumented immigrant to clean his house. The revelation potentially could derail a nomination that has elicited controversy because of Mr. Puzder's views on overtime pay, sick leave and automation. The confirmation of Mr. Puzder, a chain executive, has stalled as he tries to divest holdings. My wife and I employed a housekeeper for a few years, during which I was unaware that she was not legally permitted to work in the U. S., Mr. Puzder said in a statement. When I learned of her status, we immediately ended her employment and offered her assistance in getting legal status. Mr. Puzder added that he and his wife had paid back taxes in full to the I. R. S. and the state of California. Confirmation hearings for Mr. Puzder have been delayed as he works to remove himself from his role as the chief executive of CKE Restaurants, whose holdings include the Carl's Jr. and Hardee's chains. Democrats have suggested that his nomination could be on shaky ground, in part, because he has yet to file standard disclosures and questionnaires to the Senate committee that will consider his confirmation. Progressive groups have echoed that sentiment. It's long past time for Mr. Puzder to deliver on his commitment to file paperwork with the Senate and let the American people know what issues are causing so many headaches for the Trump administration, Karl Frisch, executive director of Allied Progress, said on Monday.

The decision to oust Mr. Christie's team, without quickly putting in place a new one, left the administration, which must still fill hundreds of top jobs, ill prepared for the nomination process. The vetting process is designed to identify issues about fitness and confirmability prior to public announcement, said Leslie B. Kiernan, a former deputy White House counsel for President Obama and now a partner with the law firm Akin Gump. The confirmation hearing for Mr. Puzder, the billionaire restaurant to head the Labor Department, was postponed several times because of a delay in filing his financial disclosure statement. Mr. Puzder's hearing is now scheduled for Thursday after the ethics office on Wednesday cleared his financial disclosure statement and ethics agreement. In the agreement, Mr. Puzder said that if confirmed, he would divest himself of his holdings in CKE Restaurants, the operator of the Hardee's and Carl's Jr. chains that he heads.

Who is the federal judge that ordered President Trump's golf resort to pay $5.7 million for refusing to refund deposits to members?,1,18170,"In a highly unusual turn of events for a sitting president, a federal judge in Florida on Wednesday ordered a golf resort owned by President Trump to pay $5. 7 million for refusing to refund deposits to members who wanted to resign from the club. In his ruling, the judge said that Mr. Trump, by sending a letter in late 2012 denying access to members who wanted to resign from the Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter a process that could take years had set off a contract clause that should have resulted in an immediate refund of their membership fees. Instead, the money was withheld. The decision is the first court judgment against a company owned by Mr. Trump since he became president last month, and underscores that while Mr. Trump has stepped away from the operations of his company, he is certain to remain dogged by legal controversies connected to his business. At his new hotel in Washington, Mr. Trump is suing two celebrity chefs for breach of contract. The two men backed out of the Trump International Hotel development in 2015 after Mr. Trump made inflammatory comments about Mexican immigrants. Separately, the federal government owns the building that houses the hotel, and some legal experts have said that Mr. Trump may be in violation of his lease, which appears to prohibit federal elected officials from leasing the building. And last month, a lawsuit was filed in federal court in Manhattan contending that Mr. Trump had violated the emoluments clause of the Constitution by allowing his hotels and other businesses to accept payments from foreign governments. Mr. Trump has not sold any of his assets, which include golf courses, commercial real estate and marketing agreements. Rather he has handed the operations of his company over to his eldest sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, a move he hopes will reduce the appearance of conflict of interest. Wednesday's ruling by Judge Kenneth Marra of Federal District Court in West Palm Beach, an appointee of President George W. Bush's calls for the club to pay $4. 85 million in withheld fees to 65 club members involved in the lawsuit, plus an additional $925, 000 in interest and other costs. As a result, those members will receive refunds of $35, 000 to $200, 000, depending on their level of membership in the club. Amanda Miller, a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, said the company planned to appeal. At the time Trump purchased the club, it was suffering financially, making it unlikely that these members would ever get back their deposits, Ms. Miller said in a statement. At trial, we presented overwhelming evidence that the plaintiffs? memberships were never recalled and that the plaintiffs had waived this argument during the course of the litigation.

To join, members paid initiation fees as high as $210, 000, depending on the type of membership that they wanted. But under s rules those deposits were refundable when a member resigned. That process, however, could take years and while members on the resignation list waited for their turn to come up they could still use the club so long as they paid annual fees and other costs like food and beverage minimums. That all changed in 2012 when the Trump Organization bought the Jupiter club. Soon afterward, Mr. Trump sent a letter to members saying that those who wanted to resign were no longer welcome there. I do not want them to utilize the club, nor do I want their dues, the letter read. After club members sued, Mr. Trump testified in 2015 during a pretrial deposition that although he had signed the letter, it was his son, Eric Trump, who was in charge of policies at the family's golf courses. Eric is much more familiar with this club, his father said. He runs it. In his pretrial deposition, Eric Trump testified that nothing had changed and that club members seeking to resign had been allowed to use the club so long as they paid their dues. That claim, however, was disputed at trial last year. One member on the resignation list, Richard Slawson, testified that the club's membership manager told him soon after the Trumps took it over that the club was . But he continued to receive $6, 000 bills for annual dues and thousands in minimum charges for food and beverages that were never consumed. I couldn't believe that we were charged that when we were not allowed to use the club, Mr. Slawson, a Florida lawyer, said in a recent telephone interview. Confronted with such testimony, the younger Mr. Trump during his court testimony backed off his assertions and acknowledged he had been mistaken.

Who is the federal judge that ordered President Trump's golf resort to pay $5.7 million for refusing to refund deposits to members?,3,17940,"? The resort doubles its initiation fee to $200, 000 leading to charges that the Trump Organization is cashing in on its founder's power. By President Trump's definition of voter fraud, his senior adviser, Steve Bannon, his Treasury secretary nominee and one of his daughters could be swept up in the investigation. The Twitter rebellion seems to be spreading as the Defense Department weighs in on Muslim refugees. The initiation fee at Mr. Trump's club in Florida which the president himself has called the Winter White House has doubled to $200, 000, after membership applications surged in the wake of Mr. Trump's election, the head of membership there said. Bernd Lembcke, the managing director at the Palm Beach, Fla. club, said the change in the initiation fee had been planned last fall, before the election, and that $200, 000 had been the fee before 2010, when it was cut in half because of the recession. But Mr. Lembcke, who has been at the club for 21 years, said that it also reflected the upswing in s popularity. We have had a sudden surge in requests, he said, adding that new members must be recommended by someone who is already a member, as is the case at many private clubs. Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen, a nonprofit group that promotes government ethics, said the move showed that Mr. Trump and his family intended to profit from his status as president. At the minimum, this creates the appearance of cashing in the presidency and selling direct personal access to the president, he said. It is unacceptable. And it demeans the office of the presidency. The new initiation fee went into effect on Jan. 1, although the annual dues remained the same $14, 000 a year, he said. The club has 482 members, with a cap of 500. It enhances it, Mr. Lembcke said of Mr. Trump's new job and its impact on the value of the membership. His presidency does. But we are very careful in vetting them, he added. News about the change in the initiation fee was reported by CNBC. By President Trump's definition, his senior White House adviser, Steve Bannon, is apparently committing voter fraud. So is his nominee to be the next Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin. So, apparently, is one of his daughters, Tiffany Trump. Mr. Trump was pretty broad with his definition of voter fraud when he took to Twitter Wednesday morning to request an investigation of the nefarious conduct of the 2016 electorate with no evidence to support it. There is, in fact, a difference between investigating actual voter fraud and cleaning up the voter rolls. If you move states, you aren't usually required to tell the state you are leaving that you no longer want to be on the roster.

What business relationship between Donald Trump and Elon Musk surprised many people?,1,17980,"The election of Donald Trump and the accompanying rehabilitation of fossil fuels should have been, by all rights, devastating for Tesla Motors. Tesla is the top maker of autos, and it completed its merger with SolarCity, a leading manufacturer of solar energy panels, days after the presidential election. Elon Musk, the visionary founder of both companies, openly criticized Mr. Trump's candidacy, saying on CNBC just before the vote that he was not the right guy? for the job. Mr. Musk has pressed for a carbon tax to combat global warming, which Mr. Trump once dismissed as a Chinese hoax. The mere mention of a carbon tax inflames the old guard of the energy industry. Moreover, both Tesla and SolarCity benefit from federal subsidies. Robert E. Murray, a coal executive and Trump supporter, has called Mr. Musk a fraud? for accepting $2 billion in government handouts. So why have Tesla shares surged since Mr. Trump's election, closing this week within striking distance of a record high? Adam Jonas, a prominent automotive analyst at Morgan Stanley, upgraded Tesla stock to overweight last week, with a target price of $305 a share. (It was trading this week at about $255.) When you look at the businesses Tesla is in, you see many areas of overlapping interest? with the Trump administration, Mr. Jonas told me. To the extent the new administration prioritizes the creation of valuable, innovative high tech and manufacturing jobs, Tesla stands at the epicenter of that. Shares in pure solar energy companies haven't fared as well, but even they have now regained nearly all the ground they lost immediately after Mr. Trump's victory. Solar investors aren't nearly as negative as they were the day after the election, said Andrew Hughes, an alternative energy analyst for Credit Suisse. One reason for that shift seems to be a budding bromance between Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk. The invited Mr. Musk to Trump Tower in December as part of a group of technology executives and named him to his strategic and policy forum of business leaders. And Mr. Musk was with a group of manufacturing executives at a White House meeting this week at which, according to a participant, he broached the subject of a carbon tax. Surprisingly, Mr. Trump didn't reject it out of hand. For his part, Mr. Musk this week endorsed Rex W. Tillerson, a pillar of the fossil fuel establishment as chief executive of Exxon Mobil, for secretary of state. Mr. Jonas said that the strategic relationship between Tesla leadership and the new administration is an important development? in his decision to upgrade Tesla stock. That Trump would be relying on Musk as an adviser has come as quite a surprise to many people, Mr. Jonas said. A major fear of investors in solar power was that a Trump administration would end the federal subsidies so reviled by fossil fuel proponents. While that remains a concern, the most recent jobs data suggests that the subsidies have led to a surge",0.41242071986198425,"{'score': 0.41242071986198425, 'start': 2606, 'end': 2650, 'answer': 'Trump would be relying on Musk as an adviser'}",Trump would be relying on Musk as an adviser,2606,2650,to upgrade Tesla stock.

Aaron Levie, chief executive of the data storage company Box, wrote on Twitter that on every level moral, humanitarian, economic, logical, etc. this ban is wrong and is completely antithetical to the principles of America. Over all, Mr. Levie said in an interview, there was a pretty resounding response from the tech industry showing how unacceptable this is. Beyond family heritage and employment, he noted, Silicon Valley cares about immigration because its companies strive to operate everywhere in the world. Almost every company's products Google, Apple, Airbnb has a global customer base, Mr. Levie said. These policy decisions have real implications to our partners, our customers, our competitors. The Trump administration is little more than a week old, but its relationship with Silicon Valley is already complicated. The tech industry did not like Mr. Trump the presidential candidate, despite his embrace of Twitter, and he returned the sentiment with caustic posts on the platform. Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist, said in 2015 that or of the C. E. O.s in Silicon Valley are from South Asia or from Asia, an incorrect statement that many in Silicon Valley perceived as racist. Yet a December meeting between the incoming administration and numerous tech chieftains was decidedly upbeat. We're going to be there for you, Mr. Trump promised to a room that included the leaders of Apple, Microsoft and Amazon. By early last week, the companies sensed trouble. Murtadha 24, an software engineer at Facebook, was told by a company lawyer on Tuesday that he needed to cut short a visit to Canada and return to the United States. The company feared that he would not be readmitted to the country because the president was expected to sign an executive order that would keep him out. It may be my na'vet? about how politics and industries interact, but I don't interpret the tech community's opposition to the president as a political stance, Mr. Tameemi said. It seemed more like a matter of values and a matter that impacts them. The larger tech companies tended to be less forceful in their reactions to the executive order than the smaller ones. Google said it was concerned. Apple said, It is not a policy we support. Amazon said only that it was committed to diversity. Oracle did not respond to requests for comment. On the other hand, Microsoft became more forceful as the weekend went on. On Saturday, its executives talked mostly about the virtues of immigration. On Sunday night, the company issued a statement calling the executive order misguided and a fundamental step backwards? and said it would create collateral damage to the country's reputation and values. Microsoft was not the only company to become bolder in a few hours. Around 10 a. m. on Saturday, Mr. Chesky of Airbnb posted a vague message on Twitter saying open doors bring all of US together.

He discovered that his name was especially attractive in developing countries where the rising rich aspired to the type of ritzy glamour he personified. While he nailed down ventures in the Philippines, India and elsewhere, closing deals in Russia proved challenging. In 2008, Donald Trump Jr. praised the opportunities in Russia, but also called it a scary place? to do business because of corruption and legal complications. Mr. Sater said that American hotel chains that had moved into Russia did so with straightforward agreements to manage hotels that other partners owned. Mr. Trump, by contrast, was pursuing developments that included residential or commercial offerings in which he would take a cut of sales, terms that Russians were reluctant to embrace. Even so, Mr. Trump said his efforts put him in contact with powerful people there. I called it my weekend in Moscow, Mr. Trump said of his 2013 trip to Moscow during a September 2015 interview on The Hugh Hewitt Show. He added: I was with the people, both oligarchs and generals, and top of the government people. I can't go further than that, but I will tell you that I met the top people, and the relationship was extraordinary. When asked about Mr. Trump's claim that he had stayed away? from Russia, Alan Garten, general counsel for the Trump Organization, said it was a fair characterization given that none of the development opportunities ever materialized. Mr. Trump's interest in Russia, he said, was no different from his attraction to other emerging markets in which he investigated possible ventures. Mr. Garten did not respond to questions about whom Mr. Trump met with in Moscow in 2013 and what was discussed. Ted Liebman, an architect based in New York, got the call in 1996. Mr. Trump and an American tobacco company that owned property in Moscow, wanted to build a residential development near an old Russian Olympic stadium. As they prepared to meet with officials in Moscow, they needed sketches of the Trump tower they envisioned. The architect scrambled to meet the request, handing over plans to Mr. Trump at his Manhattan office. I hope we can do this, Mr. Liebman recalled Mr. Trump telling him. Soon after, Mr. Trump was in Russia, promoting the proposal and singing the praises of the Russian market. I've seen cities all over the world. Some I've liked, some I haven't, Mr. Trump said at a news conference in Moscow in 1996, according to The Moscow Times. But he added that he didn't think he had ever been as impressed with the potential of a city as I have been with Moscow. Mr. Trump had been eyeing the potential for nearly a decade, expressing interest to government officials ranging from the Soviet leader Mikhail S.

Who vowed to take executive action on a nearly daily basis to unravel his predecessor's legacy and begin enacting his own agenda?,1,17838,"WASHINGTON President Trump plans to take executive action on a nearly daily basis for a month to unravel his predecessor's legacy and begin enacting his own agenda, his aides say, part of an extended exercise of presidential power to quickly make good on his campaign promises. But in a reflection of the improvisational style that helped fuel his rise, he has made few, if any, firm decisions about which orders he wants to make, or in which order. That is a striking break from past presidents, who have entered office with detailed plans for rolling out a series of executive actions that set a tone for their presidencies and send a clear message about their agendas. It was plain that Mr. Trump had devised no such strategy by his first day in office, as advisers expressed doubt until the last moments about whether he would issue any directives on Friday. It's going to be a decision, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, told reporters that afternoon. Then, around 7 p. m. reporters were suddenly summoned to the Oval Office. After sprinting from the briefing room, they watched Mr. Trump sign a directive to federal agencies to begin scaling back parts of the Affordable Care Act. There are a number that are being looked at, but it's just a question of which ones he feels like doing, and when, Mr. Spicer had said of executive orders earlier on Friday. In recent days, he had said that Mr. Trump's top aides were still deciding on the sequencing? of the unilateral actions. Still, there is little doubt about the policy areas in Mr. Trump's sights: international trade deals, illegal immigration, the fight against the Islamic State, climate change and Washington lobbying. In his first in office, Mr. Trump focused on health care, ordering the machinery of government to look for every opportunity to pull back on President Barack Obama's signature achievement by waiving fees or granting exemptions to states, businesses, individuals and insurance companies. He also moved quickly to freeze the Obama administration's unfinished regulations, a routine step for an incoming president of the opposite party. During the campaign, Mr. Trump railed against Mr. Obama's use of executive authority to sidestep an uncooperative Congress on issues like immigration and health care. After his victory, Mr. Trump vowed to use those same powers to quickly reverse the country's ideological course. Aides said they hoped to group Mr. Trump's executive actions thematically for maximum impact. They gave few other details, though some advisers suggested that executive actions on illegal immigration could be among the first issued after the inaugural weekend. Advocates for undocumented workers are anxiously waiting to see what Mr. Trump will do. If he moves aggressively, he could immediately overturn Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA the program Mr. Obama created to protect young immigrants who were brought illegally to the United States as children, giving them legal status and access to work permits.

Who vowed to take executive action on a nearly daily basis to unravel his predecessor's legacy and begin enacting his own agenda?,2,17977,"WASHINGTON When President Obama relied heavily on executive orders to push through policies that had no chance in Congress, Republicans called him a dictator who abused his power and disregarded the Constitution. They even took him to court. We have an increasingly lawless presidency where he is actually doing the job of Congress, writing new policies and laws without going through Congress, Representative Paul D. Ryan, then the Budget Committee chairman, said in a 2014 television interview after Mr. Obama made clear in his State of the Union address that he would readily take unilateral action to get his way. Now President Trump, at the start of his tenure, is relying heavily on executive actions not just to reverse Obama administration initiatives, but to enact new federal policies covering immigration, health care and other areas in ways that could be seen more as the province of the House and Senate. And he is doing that with clear Republican majorities in Congress. The flurry of administration edicts flowing from the Trump White House puts some top Republicans in the awkward position of welcoming aggressive executive muscle flexing from a president of their own party after castigating Mr. Obama for using the same approach. Their rationale: Mr. Obama took executive action too far, stretching the intent of legislation to fulfill an ideological agenda. We've never been against executive action, said Ashlee Strong, a spokeswoman for Mr. Ryan, now the House speaker. We're against overreaching, illegal action. Mr. Trump's eager embrace of the executive order he signaled clearly during his campaign that he intended to follow his predecessor's lead allows him to claim immediate progress on his campaign promises rather than waiting for a lengthy legislative process to play out. Many of his major proposals building a border wall, hiring more border and immigration officers, creating a new office for victims of crimes committed by immigrants in the country illegally will presumably require funding by Congress, and that is no certainty in the current political environment. The question then becomes how Mr. Trump would proceed if Congress balks. House Republicans are currently suing the executive branch and winning in a case that argues the Obama administration spent more than $13 billion on health insurance subsidies without necessary congressional approval in a clear breach of the Constitution. The health care executive order issued by Mr. Trump last week directed federal officials to find ways to minimize the financial burden of the health care law on governments, health care providers and others. Many saw the move as a backdoor attempt by the new White House to undermine the current law of the land while Republicans try to figure out a way to repeal it. It was the reverse of the type of action Republicans criticized President Obama for using his executive powers to prop up the health care law without sufficient authority.

Calling himself the greatest that God ever created, Mr. Trump pledged to continue leaning on American companies to keep jobs in the United States. He took particular aim at the pharmaceutical industry, which he said has been disastrous? and had been getting away with murder? on drug pricing. Taking on a powerful lobby that Republicans have long defended, Mr. Trump said he wanted the federal government to use its purchasing power to negotiate drug prices for Medicare and Medicaid a proposal long favored by Democrats.

He also insisted, despite repeated denials by Mexican officials, that Mexico would pay to build a wall on the southern border of the United States to block foreigners from entering illegally.

The word undesirable? was printed on his discharge records. But now, at 91, Mr. Spires said he can finally be at peace with that part of his life. On Friday, he was awakened by a phone call to his Connecticut home and learned that the Air Force Board for the Correction of Military Records had agreed to change his status. This time, his discharge would be described as honorable. It was a long haul, Mr. Spires said on Tuesday in phone call from his home in Norwalk. I got the confirmation that I had been looking for. Said his husband, David Rosenberg, whom he met in 1956 and married eight years ago: His first words were, It's about time.? Mr. Spires is one of the hundreds of gay former military personnel who have been emboldened by the 2010 repeal of the United States military's Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy, which prohibited gay men and lesbians from serving openly in the military. In 2011, the federal government allowed changes to veterans? military records, some of which had been labeled undesirable? or other than honorable. The incentives for doing so were sometimes financial. Such designations could make it difficult for the men and women who had served to get employment, loans or access to veterans benefits. But there was another, more important reason. The respect factor, said Matt Thorn, an executive director at Legal Defense Network, which helps veterans with the application process needed to reverse such designations. I served my country honorably I want that respect. And they should have that. Mr. Thorn said many go through an application process that can take up to 18 months. But for Mr. Spires, who recently recovered from pneumonia, it took years of effort that will now allow him to have a burial, when the time comes, with military honors.

We were not necessarily discharging people for just being gay, she said. It was associated with misconduct if it was a dishonorable discharge.

Other documents found in 2016 showed he served in the military from 1946 to 1948, when he was discharged from Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio. To help his case, Mr. Spires also filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court for the District of Connecticut in November, assisted by the Yale Law School's Veterans Legal Services Clinic. The lawsuit asserted that Mr. Spires's rights had been violated after he encountered unreasonable delays in the Air Force review to change his discharge status to honorable. According to the lawsuit and to Mr. Spires account, his life as a young chaplain's assistant at the base included playing the organ at services and typing letters to distressed families. He attended social events with gay men outside of the base, he said. At a Halloween party in 1947, Mr. Spires dressed in a costume inspired by a sparkly laundry soap.

I had a whole slew of very good friends who were gay and lived off base. We partied together we had wonderful meals together and went to the opera together. We lived a very normal life. I did not dishonor the Air Force in any way by my actions, Mr. Spires said in the interview. He was discharged and sent home to Lancaster, Ohio, in civilian clothes.

His medical records from the military all said he had not been exposed. When the job was done, they threw my bulldozer in the ocean because it was so hot, Mr. Laird said. If it got that much radiation, how the hell did it miss me? As the cleanup continued, federal officials tried to institute safety measures. A shipment of yellow radiation suits arrived on the islands in 1978, but in interviews veterans said that they were too hot to wear in the tropical sun and that the military told them that it was safe to go without them. The military tried to monitor plutonium inhalation using air samplers. But they soon broke. According to an Energy Department memo, in 1978, only a third of the samplers were working. All troops were issued a small film badge to measure radiation exposure, but government memos note that humid conditions destroyed the film. Failure rates often reached 100 percent. Every evening, Air Force technicians scanned workers for plutonium particles before they left Runit. Men said dozens of workers each day had screened positive for dangerous levels of radiation. Sometimes we'd get readings that were all the way to the red, said one technician, David Roach, 57, who now lives in Rockland, Me. None of the high readings were recorded, said Mr. Roach, who has since had several strokes. Two members of Congress wrote to the secretary of defense in 1978 with concerns, but his office told them not to worry: Suits and respirators ensured the cleanup was conducted in a manner as to assure that radiation exposure to individuals is limited to the lowest levels practicable. Even after the cleanup, many of the islands were still too radioactive to inhabit. In 1988, Congress passed a law providing automatic medical care to any troops involved in the original atomic testing. But the act covers veterans only up to 1958, when atomic testing stopped, excluding the Enewetak cleanup crews. If civilian contractors had done the cleanup and later discovered declassified documents that show the government failed to follow its own safety plan, they could sue for negligence. Veterans don't have that right. A 1950 Supreme Court ruling bars troops and their families from suing for injuries arising from military service. The veterans? only avenue for help is to apply individually to the Department of Veterans Affairs for free medical care and disability payments.
