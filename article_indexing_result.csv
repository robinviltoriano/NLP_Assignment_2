0,175741,"SEOUL, South Korea A special prosecutor investigating the corruption scandal that led to President Park s impeachment summoned the de facto head of Samsung for questioning on Wednesday, calling him a bribery suspect. The de facto leader, Jay Y. Lee, the vice chairman of Samsung, will be questioned on Thursday, according to the special prosecutor's office, which recommended that he also be investigated on suspicion of perjury. Mr. Lee effectively runs Samsung, South Korea's largest conglomerate he is the son of its chairman, Lee who has been incapacitated with health problems. He is expected to be asked whether donations that Samsung made to two foundations controlled by Choi a longtime friend of the president, amounted to bribes, and what role, if any, he played in the decision to give the money. Investigators at the special prosecutor's office have questioned other senior Samsung executives as suspects about the bribery accusations. Neither Samsung nor Mr. Lee responded immediately to the announcement on Wednesday. Allegations that Ms. Park helped Ms. Choi extort millions in bribes from Samsung and other companies are at the heart of the corruption scandal that led to the National Assembly's vote to impeach her last month. Since then, Ms. Park's powers have been suspended, and she is on trial at the Constitutional Court, which will ultimately decide whether to end her presidency. Last month, Mr. Lee testified at a National Assembly hearing that he was not involved in the decision by Samsung to make the donations. He also said that the donations were not voluntary, suggesting that the company was a victim of extortion, not a participant in bribery. The reference on Wednesday to possible perjury charges against Mr. Lee stemmed from that testimony. The special prosecutor's office said it had evidence that Mr. Lee had received a request for bribery from the president and ordered Samsung subsidiaries to send bribes to destinations designated by the president. It asked the National Assembly to file a perjury complaint against Mr. Lee, which would authorize the special prosecutor to open an investigation of that charge. Asked whether investigators would seek to arrest Mr. Lee on bribery charges, a spokesman for the special prosecutor's office, Lee said, All possibilities are open. In November, state prosecutors indicted Ms. Choi on charges of coercing 53 big businesses, including Samsung, to contribute $69 million to her two foundations. They identified Ms. Park as an accomplice but stopped short of filing any charges against the businesses, all of which insisted that they were under government pressure to donate. In its impeachment bill, the National Assembly asserted that the donations were bribes, made with the expectation of political favors from the president. The special prosecutor, which took over the investigations from the state prosecutors last month, has been looking into possible bribery charges against not only Ms. Park but the businesses, particularly Samsung. Ms. Park cannot be indicted while in office. Samsung gave the largest donations to Ms. Choi's foundations, totaling $17 million. Unlike the other corporate",0.93238395
1,177641,"SEOUL, South Korea A South Korean court on Thursday blocked a prosecutor's attempt to arrest Jay Y. Lee, the leader of Samsung, saying there was not enough evidence that Mr. Lee had bribed President Park in a scandal that led to her impeachment. A justice on the Central District Court in Seoul, Cho rejected the prosecutor's request to issue an arrest warrant, saying said it was difficult to recognize the need? to incarcerate Mr. Lee. Mr. Lee, a scion and vice chairman of Samsung, one of the world's biggest conglomerates, was immediately released from a detention center outside Seoul, where he had been waiting for the court to decide whether he should be formally arrested. South Koreans have paid keen attention to the fate of Mr. Lee. Some analysts said his case was a test of whether the country's relatively youthful democracy and judicial system are ready to crack down on the crimes of conglomerates. No Samsung leader has ever been jailed, though the company has been investigated many times for corruption. The court's decision is likely to anger many South Koreans who have held weekend rallies calling for Ms. Park's ouster and the arrest of business tycoons on corruption charges. The special prosecutor called the court decision very regrettable. But he has yet to announce whether he will offer more evidence in a renewed effort to have Mr. Lee arrested. He can also indict Mr. Lee on bribery or lesser charges without arresting him. We will take necessary steps and persist in our investigation without wavering, said Lee a spokesman for the special prosecutor, without elaborating. Samsung welcomed the court's decision. For now, the ruling allows Mr. Lee to continue to lead Samsung. It dealt a blow to the special prosecutor who had tried to build a bribery case against Mr. Lee and Ms. Park. Mr. Lee's father has twice been convicted of bribery and tax evasion but has never spent a day in prison. Each time, he received a presidential pardon and returned to management. Mr. Lee, 48, was accused of paying $36 million to Ms. Park's secretive confidante, Choi . The special prosecutor and Mr. Lee's lawyers have been arguing over how to characterize the money. In November, state prosecutors indicted Ms. Choi on extortion charges, saying she leveraged her connections with Ms. Park to coerce Samsung and scores of other big businesses to contribute tens of millions of dollars to two foundations Ms. Choi controlled or to companies run by her or her associates. They identified Ms. Park as an accomplice, but they brought no charges against the businesses, which they saw as victims of extortion. But the special prosecutor, Park who took over the investigation from state prosecutors last month, has called Samsung's contributions bribes that were exchanged for political favors from Ms. Park. That includes government support for a merger of two Samsung affiliates in 2015, which helped Mr. Lee inherit corporate control from his incapacitated father, the chairman, Lee according to the prosecutor.",0.75574094

That includes government support for a merger of two Samsung affiliates in 2015, which helped Mr. Lee inherit corporate control from his incapacitated father, the chairman, Lee according to the prosecutor. groups accused the prosecutor of overreaching in an attempt to find a scapegoat to soothe a public infuriated over Ms. Park's corruption scandal and fed up with decades of collusive ties between the government and the chaebol. Mr. Lee was the most prominent businessman to be ensnared in the special prosecutor's broadening investigation into the corruption scandal that led to Ms. Park's impeachment by Parliament last month. Ms. Park's presidential powers remained suspended, while the Constitutional Court is expected to rule in coming weeks whether she should be reinstated or formally removed from office. We have been too lenient toward chaebol corruption, said Moon an opposition politician who leads in polls on contenders to replace Ms. Park if she is removed. Speaking to a group of foreign reporters hours before the court's decision, Mr. Moon said Samsung was typical of a chaebol whose top boss wielded imperial powers? over his sprawling business group but was seldom held accountable? for corruption or managerial failures. Ms. Park denies any wrongdoing. Mr. Lee and Samsung have also denied bribery they argued that the donations?

3,175742,"over the investigations from the state prosecutors last month, has been looking into possible bribery charges against not only Ms. Park but the businesses, particularly Samsung. Ms. Park cannot be indicted while in office. Samsung gave the largest donations to Ms. Choi's foundations, totaling $17 million. Unlike the other corporate contributors, it went beyond support for the foundations, signing an $18 million contract with a sports management company that Ms. Choi ran in Germany, to fund a program for training Korean equestrians, which mainly benefited Ms. Choi's daughter. Samsung also contributed $1. 3 million to a winter sports program for young athletes that Ms. Choi and her nephew ran. Also on Wednesday, the special prosecutor's office said it had acquired a tablet computer used by Ms. Choi that contained emails she exchanged with a Samsung executive. The emails contained information about the financial support provided by Samsung, the prosecutor's office said. The special prosecutor has been investigating whether Samsung gave its support to Ms. Choi in exchange for a decision by the National Pension Service to support a contentious merger of two Samsung affiliates in 2015. Moon chairman of the pension fund, was arrested last month on charges that he illegally pressured the fund to back that merger when he was South Korea's health and welfare minister. The national pension fund's support was crucial for the merger, which analysts said helped Mr. Lee inherit control of Samsung from his father.",0.0065609324

In an email, Jee, a spokeswoman for Samsung, said it was one of many multinational corporations? that responded to questions from South Korean regulators. Qualcomm's lawyer figures the Korean case may take years to move through the courts. And recent events, including the impeachment of South Korea's president and a bribery scandal at Samsung, could complicate, or eliminate, Qualcomm's regulatory issues there. Additionally, the F. T.

She may be named chairwoman when the current chairwoman, Edith Ramirez, a Democrat, steps down on Feb. 10. Neither the F. T. C. nor Apple would comment on the United States case against Qualcomm. It's disappointing when our partners want to pay less after we've contributed to their success, said Derek Aberle, Qualcomm's president. Now it must get out ahead of other technology inventors in 5G, possibly while paying billions in fines and dealing with a painful restructuring and fraying relationships with its biggest customers. We're not sitting still? while the problems are sorted, Mr. Aberle said. You have to invest, and invent cool stuff that will change the way people live their lives.

5,176291,"LOS ANGELES The chief executive of Sony's underperforming entertainment division, Michael Lynton, announced Friday that he would step down to focus more intently on the popular messaging service Snapchat, where he was an early investor. Mr. Lynton, who weathered various corporate crises at Sony Entertainment over his tenure, including a devastating cyberattack and a battle with activist investors, will step down on Feb. 2, the company said. After that, Kazuo Hirai, the president and chief executive of Sony Corporation, based in Tokyo, will take a more role at the conglomerate's movie, television and music division, at least for a time. Mr. Hirai will begin keeping a second office at Sony's studio complex in Culver City, Calif. the company said, and take the additional title of executive of Sony Entertainment. Mr. Lynton will also serve as executive for a period starting in February to help Mr. Hirai learn the inner workings of the movie and television businesses and select a permanent successor. In the meantime, Mr. Lynton, 57, will officially become chairman of the board at Snap Inc. which owns Snapchat. Snap is expected to go public with an eye toward being valued at $30 billion or more this spring. As chairman, Mr. Lynton is not expected to play a direct management role, but rather focus on matters involving strategy and governance in support of Evan Spiegel, Snap's chief executive. I have been involved with Evan and Snapchat since its early days, and, given its growth since then, decided the time was right to transition, Mr. Lynton said in a statement. He added that he was confident that the broad changes we have made and new management team we have assembled over the last few years? at Sony would bear fruit. Despite wrenching turnaround efforts Mr. Lynton hired a new movie chief in 2015 Sony's film operation, which includes the Columbia, Screen Gems and TriStar labels, has experienced a prolonged shortage of breakout hits. Last year, Sony released 22 movies (not including those distributed by its New art house unit) and collected $911. 5 million at the domestic box office, with moderate successes like The Angry Birds Movie? offset by clunkers like The Brothers Grimsby. Among the six major Hollywood studios, only Paramount fared worse, with 15 releases taking in $876. 8 million. The leader, Walt Disney Studios, where Mr. Lynton worked in the 1990s, had 13 releases and $3 billion in domestic sales. In a statement, Mr. Hirai said Mr. Lynton's structural changes set the path for restoring profitability and future growth, though we recognize current challenges in the motion picture businesses and its turnaround will take some time. That suggests Mr. Hirai plans to be patient with Thomas E. Rothman, the chairman of Sony Pictures, who has ruffled feathers at the studio as he has pushed for change. Mr. Hirai also emphasized that the studio was not for sale a persistent topic of Hollywood speculation calling movies, television and music essential parts of Sony.

6,173541,"The Wall Street lawyer Walter J. Clayton does not travel in political circles, nor is he well known in corporate America. He is the insider's insider a deal maker. As such, his nomination to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission is a strong signal that financial regulation in the Trump administration will emphasize helping companies raise capital in the public markets over tightening regulation. In contrast, the agency's two chairwomen under President Obama had regulatory or enforcement backgrounds. Mr. Clayton, known as Jay, has spent nearly his entire career in corporate boardrooms. His regulatory experience stems from advising banks on dealings with the government and helping several financial institutions with their settlements related to mortgage securities. He had a seat to the financial crisis, advising Barclays Capital in buying the assets of the bankrupt Lehman Brothers in 2008 and Bear Stearns in its fire sale to JPMorgan Chase in 2007. He has advised on mergers and initial public offerings, including the biggest ever, the $25 billion offering by Alibaba Group of China in 2013. If Mr. Clayton is confirmed, he may have to recuse himself from some matters. A similar scrutiny was applied to Mary Jo White, the agency's current chairwoman. She had been a litigator at Debevoise Plimpton, where her clients included JPMorgan Chase, Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and Kenneth D. Lewis, a former Bank of America chief executive. Still, such recusals are not unusual. Laura S. Unger, a former commissioner and acting chairwoman, said that during her tenure, she had to recuse herself from a number of matters before the commission. She said the process of deciding when to recuse oneself often took place in consultation with the commission's ethics officer. An ethics officer at the S. E. C. knows all of your intimate details, and the ethics officer flags for you what may be potential conflicts, she noted. Yet Mr. Clayton's nomination will be sure to fuel criticism that Goldman Sachs could wield too much influence in the Trump administration. Sullivan Cromwell, where Mr. Clayton is a partner, has been Goldman's law firm for more than a century. Mr. Clayton advised Goldman Sachs on perhaps its most important deal, the $5 billion investment by Warren E. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway amid the financial crisis. Mr. Clayton's wife works as a adviser at Goldman. The S. E. C. nomination follows the appointment of Goldman's No. 2 executive, Gary D. Cohn, to be the top economic policy adviser to Donald J. Trump, and the selection of a hedge fund manager who was a former Goldman trader, Steven T. Mnuchin, to be Treasury secretary. Mr. Trump's chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, is a former Goldman banker. During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump had repeatedly criticized Goldman Sachs as an emblem of a financial elite. Mr. Trump, who met with Mr. Clayton on Dec. 22, said in a statement that the lawyer will ensure our financial institutions can thrive and create jobs while playing by the rules at the same time.
