18388,Julie Hirschfeld Davis,9/02/2017,2017,2,business,"WASHINGTON  ?   Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, President Trump?s nominee for the Supreme Court, privately expressed dismay on Wednesday over Mr. Trump?s increasingly aggressive attacks on the judiciary, calling the president?s criticism of independent judges ?demoralizing? and ?disheartening. ? The remarks by Judge Gorsuch,  chosen  by Mr. Trump last week to serve on the nation?s highest court, came as the president lashed out at the federal appellate judges who are considering a challenge to his executive order banning travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries. The president called their judicial proceedings ?disgraceful? and described the courts as ?so political. ? Those remarks followed Mr. Trump?s weekend Twitter outburst in which he derided a Seattle district court judge who blocked his travel ban as a ?  judge? whose ?ridiculous? ruling would be overturned. Judge Gorsuch expressed his disappointment with Mr. Trump?s comments about the judiciary in a private conversation with Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, as he paid courtesy calls on Capitol Hill to build support for his confirmation. An account of the discussion was confirmed by a White House adviser working to advance the Gorsuch confirmation, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment. The spectacle of a Supreme Court nominee breaking so starkly with the president who named him underscored the unusual nature of Mr. Trump?s public feud with the judiciary. Speaking to a group of sheriffs and police chiefs on Wednesday, the president said the appellate judges had failed to grasp concepts even ?a bad high school student would understand. ? ?This is highly unusual,? said Michael W. McConnell, a former federal judge who directs the Constitutional Law Center at Stanford University. ?Mr. Trump is shredding longstanding norms of etiquette and interbranch comity. ? Presidents have traditionally tried to refrain from even appearing to intervene in court cases that concern them or their policies, or from impugning the motives and qualifications of jurists charged with deciding them, according to judges and legal experts from across the political spectrum. The tradition is important to preserving the separation of powers that is a pillar of American democracy, establishing an independent judiciary to serve as a check on the executive branch, they argued. Mr. Trump?s rhetorical battle with the judiciary may also end up harming his cause in a case that may end up before the Supreme Court, by potentially stiffening the resolve of judges who feel their independence is under attack. Mr. McConnell called Mr. Trump?s comments ?extremely   and  ? because of their potential to sway judges to rule against Mr. Trump. ?Judges who hear criticism of this sort are not going to be inclined to knuckle under it?s going to stiffen their spines to be even more independent,? said Mr. McConnell, who was nominated to his judgeship by President George W. Bush. Jeffrey Rosen, the president of the National Constitution Center, a nonprofit organization in Philadelphia devoted to explaining the Constitution, said there was a rich history of presidents strongly criticizing judges on matters of law. ?But those criticisms were based on constitutional disagreements about the rulings, and it?s hard to think of a president who has challenged the motives of specific judges by name repeatedly, especially before a case is decided, or used the same kind of invective as Mr. Trump has toward the court,? Mr. Rosen said. ?Judicial independence is a fragile and crucial achievement of American constitutionalism,? he added, ?and it depends on the public seeing the judiciary as something more than politicians in robes. ? Yet Mr. Trump, who as president has the power to nominate members of the federal judiciary, appears bent instead on portraying independent judges who hold the fate of his travel ban in their hands as partisans who refuse to give him the power to which he is entitled to protect the nation. ?I don?t ever want to call a court biased, so I won?t call it biased,? Mr. Trump said on Wednesday. ?But courts seem to be so political, and it would be so great for our justice system if they would be able to read a statement and do what?s right. ? Mr. Trump, who opened his remarks to law enforcement officers reciting the passage of the United States code that gives the president the power to restrict immigration whenever he deems the influx of foreigners detrimental to the country, said he had watched ?in amazement? Tuesday night as a   federal appeals panel heard arguments on his executive order and the limits of presidential power in cases of national security. ?I listened to a bunch of stuff last night on television that was disgraceful,? Mr. Trump said. ?I think it?s sad. I think it?s a sad day. I think our security is at risk today. ? His comments came the morning after a lively, roughly hourlong hearing  ?   the audio of which was carried live on national television  ?   during which three judges on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit expressed skepticism about the arguments of a Justice Department lawyer defending Mr. Trump?s order. Judge James L. Robart of the Federal District Court in Seattle blocked the travel ban on Friday, and the appeals court is considering whether to uphold that action, with a ruling expected as early as Thursday. Mr. Trump took aim at one of the judges without specifying which, saying, ?I will not comment on the statements made by, certainly one judge. ? The panel was made up of Judge William C. Canby Jr. appointed by President Jimmy Carter Judge Richard R. Clifton, named by Mr. Bush and Judge Michelle T. Friedland, nominated by President Barack Obama. ?If these judges wanted to, in my opinion, help the court in terms of respect for the court, they?d do what they should be doing,? Mr. Trump said. ?It?s so sad. ? By contrast, he lavished praise on Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton, a federal district judge in Boston who last week ruled that the travel ban could stay in place. ?Right on  ?   they were perfect,? Mr. Trump said of Judge Gorton?s comments. Mr. Trump is hardly the first president to criticize or seek to apply pressure to the courts Mr. Obama admonished Supreme Court justices as they sat before him in the House chamber during his 2010 State of the Union address for their ruling in the Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission case that allowed corporations to spend freely to influence elections. John Yoo, a former counsel to Mr. Bush, argued that Mr. Trump was using a potent weapon that has been used throughout history  ?   the presidential prerogative to provoke a constitutional crisis when a vital issue is at stake  ?   on an insignificant matter. ?I hate to see a president waste that kind of authority, which should only be deployed for our most important questions, on this immigration order, which the president could easily withdraw, fix and resubmit,? said Mr. Yoo, now a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley. ?President Trump is pressing the accelerator down to 120 miles per hour on every single issue. He will exhaust himself and exhaust his presidency. ? Peter Wallison, a former White House counsel to Ronald Reagan, said the president often wished to weigh in on legal matters concerning personal friends or issues important to his administration, and Mr. Wallison always advised against it, both to protect the tradition of judicial independence and avoid undercutting the courts? legitimacy. ?It?s not illegal, it?s not a violation of the law to say these things, but it?s bad policy because it raises questions about the independence of the courts, and it raises questions about the judicial system as a whole when the president says this,? Mr. Wallison said. Mr. Reagan did not always take his advice, he added, and in those instances, ?I always cringed. ? Mr. Trump defended the process that yielded the executive order, saying he had initially wanted to wait a week or even a month before issuing the travel ban. But he said he was told by law enforcement officials that doing so would prompt a flood of people, including some with ?very evil intentions,? to rush into the United States before the restrictions took effect. That account appears to be at odds with the one given by several senior officials, who have said they were not fully briefed on the details of Mr. Trump?s order until the day the president signed it at the Pentagon. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump told the law enforcement officers that he was acting solely out of a concern about terrorism, a threat he said had deepened since he took office and gained access to information about the risks facing Americans. ?Believe me, I?ve learned a lot in the last two weeks, and terrorism is a far greater threat than the people of our country understand,? Mr. Trump said. ?But we?re going to take care of it. We?re going to win. ?"
17538,Glenn Thrush and Maggie Haberman,10/01/2017,2017,1,business,"WASHINGTON  ?   Jared Kushner will become a senior White House adviser to his    Donald J. Trump, cementing the New York real estate executive?s role as a powerful and at times decisive influence on the  . Mr. Kushner, 35, who married Mr. Trump?s daughter Ivanka in 2009, is closer to Mr. Trump than any other adviser, a steady and stabilizing presence inside an often chaotic transition team who has provided input on most of his   ?s most consequential hiring and firing decisions. Mr. Trump described Mr. Kushner as ?a tremendous asset and trusted adviser throughout the campaign and transition? in a statement issued early Monday evening announcing an appointment that perhaps more than any other defines the way the incoming president will govern. Mr. Kushner plans to sell some of his real estate holdings and other assets, his lawyer said. Some ethics experts have questioned whether the appointment will be legal under federal   laws designed to prevent family ties from influencing the functioning of the United States government. Other presidents configured their White House hierarchies to mirror experiences in statehouses, on campaigns or at the heads of armies. Mr. Trump intends to adopt the management style of a New York real estate empire, with family at the pinnacle and staff members, however trusted or talented, somewhere below. Ms. Trump, who also participated in her father?s campaign decisions, has no immediate plans to enter the administration and will restructure her portfolio of holdings. But she plans to step down from the management of the Trump Organization and the Ivanka Trump fashion brand, said Jamie S. Gorelick, Mr. Kushner?s lawyer. Mr. Kushner?s plan is to sell assets to his brother and to a trust overseen by his mother, said Ms. Gorelick, who added that she had been consulting with federal ethics officials in an attempt to minimize opposition to Mr. Kushner?s appointment. Under the arrangement, Mr. Kushner will divest his holdings in his family real estate firm?s flagship property at 666 Fifth Avenue sell his stake in the New York Observer newspaper divest his interest in his brother?s firm, Thrive Capital and restructure other investments. He will also divest of all foreign investments, said Ms. Gorelick, who served as deputy attorney general in the Clinton administration. He will have to recuse himself on matters that could relate to his wife?s businesses and his remaining holdings, she added. Mr. Kushner has been described by numerous transition staff members as the first among equals in Mr. Trump?s high command. His new title belies the sweeping influence he will have behind the scenes. The   Mr. Kushner has often been described as having a calming effect on Mr. Trump, who is notorious for yelling at staff members during moments of tension. Mr. Kushner became the de facto campaign manager in the spring, and his influence with Mr. Trump has expanded rapidly. He is expected to play the same role in the White House, while the chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, provides the   with strategic, messaging and communications advice, and Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee and the incoming chief of staff, runs    operations in the West Wing. Mr. Trump?s counselor, Kellyanne Conway, will have a direct line to the president on a range of issues. Despite his lack of   political experience before the 2016 campaign, Mr. Kushner earned the trust of his mercurial    during the campaign?s most turbulent moments, joining his wife and Mr. Trump?s adult sons, Eric and Donald Jr. in ousting Corey Lewandowski, then the campaign manager, in the heat of the primary season. Mr. Kushner was among those who pushed, campaign officials said, for the removal of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey as the head of Mr. Trump?s transition team, and pressed for his    to appoint David M. Friedman, a Long Island lawyer, as ambassador to Israel. Mr. Kushner, an orthodox Jew, has also made an unlikely ally of Mr. Bannon, an icon of the   nationalist movement. When Mr. Bannon, a former Breitbart executive, came under attack from Democrats after he was appointed to a White House role, Mr. Kushner assured allies that he had complete faith in Mr. Bannon and described him as a man of character. Mr. Kushner will not take a salary and plans to work on issues involving the Middle East and Israel try to forge government partnerships with the private sector and collaborate with Mr. Trump?s choice for commerce secretary, Wilbur L. Ross Jr. on matters involving free trade, Ms. Gorelick said. The scion of a prominent Democratic family active in New Jersey politics, Mr. Kushner showed few early signs that he would become a national political power player. A Harvard graduate, he is a lifelong Democrat, liberal on social issues. Like his ideologically limber    he has donated to Democratic candidates. Mr. Kushner?s appointment was greeted with relief by some liberals, including Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, who views him as moderating influence in a Trump West Wing dominated by   conservatives. ?I respect him a lot,? Mr. de Blasio said when asked about Mr. Kushner on Monday. ?I?ve known him for years and find him to be a very reasonable person. ? Still, it remains unclear if Mr. Kushner is inclined to prod the   to the left. By his own account, he underwent something of a personal political transformation during the campaign, embracing Mr. Trump?s fiery and conservative economic message after spending months crisscrossing red and   America. Mr. Kushner?s new role became public a day after the disclosure that he would resign as chief executive of Kushner Companies, his family?s real estate firm, and divest himself of ?substantial assets,? including 666 Fifth Avenue. Mr. Kushner will divest of his holdings in The Observer and has stepped down as its publisher his    the newspaper?s chairman, will assume that role. Mr. Trump is scheduled to hold a news conference on Wednesday to discuss his plans for dealing with myriad conflicts of interest raised by his sprawling international development, hotel, branding and entertainment empire. Ms. Gorelick said she was confident Mr. Kushner?s appointment would survive any legal challenge, and said Mr. Trump would seek an advisory opinion from the Department of Justice?s Office of Legal Counsel. ?I am not saying there?s no legal argument on the other side,? she added. ?I?m just saying we have the better argument and will prevail. ? Mr. Trump made it clear since he was elected that he wanted Mr. Kushner in his White House. Since December, Mr. Kushner and Ms. Gorelick?s team have consulted with the Office of Government Ethics to create a plan that would satisfy the legal requirements needed for him to serve. Mr. Kushner?s father, Charles Kushner, a real estate developer who was once imprisoned for tax evasion, will take an increased role in the family company. Norman L. Eisen, who was the chief White House ethics lawyer under President Obama, said he thought Mr. Kushner?s decision to divest holdings raised pressure on Mr. Trump to follow suit. ?What we are seeing now is, after the initial chaos of the Trump transition, that his nominees are now complying with the requirements of the law,? he said. ?Rex Tillerson has retired from Exxon, and now Kushner is doing the same,? he added, referring to Mr. Trump?s nominee for secretary of state. ?So it?s going to be hard for Trump to ignore 40 years of precedent and not do the same. ?"
17341,Chris Buckley,1/02/2017,2017,2,sports,"QINGYUAN, China  ?   The 48 soccer fields of the vast Evergrande Football School in south China seem barely enough for its 2, 800 students. Against a backdrop of school spires that seem modeled on Hogwarts, the young athletes swarm onto the fields nearly every day, kicking, dribbling and passing in the hope of soccer glory and riches. ?Soccer will be my career after I grow up,? Wang Kai, a gangly    who has studied at the boarding school for over three years, said after a morning session under the supervision of a Spanish coach. ?I want to be the Chinese Cristiano Ronaldo,? he said, referring to the Portuguese superstar. Grooming the next Ronaldo or Messi has become a national project in China, where the country?s No. 1 fan, President Xi Jinping, is bent on transforming the country into a great soccer power. It is a moonshot for China, whose teams have ranked poor to middling in recent international competition. But the effort has already unleashed a surge of spending and support for the game that has stunned fans and players around the world. In the last two weeks, the main Chinese league has plucked foreign stars from Europe and South America with contracts reported to be worth as much as $40 million a year, the highest pay for any soccer player in the world. A Chinese club offered the real Ronaldo $105 million a year, but he declined, his agent said last week. These giddying sums are shaking the landscape of pro soccer. Antonio Conte, the manager of England?s fabled Chelsea team, denounced the Chinese spending spree last month as a ?danger for all teams in the world. ? The drive to match China?s economic ascent with success on the soccer field has become emblematic of Mr. Xi?s ambition to transform China into a great and confident power. ?My biggest hope for Chinese soccer is that its teams become among the world?s best,? he announced in 2015. In the last two years, the government has poured the kind of concentrated effort into soccer that it has previously devoted to winning Olympic medals in individual sports like diving and gymnastics. It has promised to clean up and reorganize professional soccer and build a new generation of players by creating tens of thousands of soccer fields and adding soccer programs in tens of thousands of schools. The aim is to establish a flow of top players eventually capable of winning the coveted men?s World Cup and returning the women?s team to its former glory. That effort has emboldened Chinese clubs to spend lavishly. As well as paying tens of millions for foreign players, Chinese team owners have spent hundreds of millions of dollars buying into European clubs, hoping to tap their coaching and marketing expertise. ?Current spending has created massive expectations,? said Simon Chadwick, a professor of sports enterprise at the University of Salford in Britain. ?Spending big on players is also about acquiring heroes and icons. ? But if soccer distills Mr. Xi?s national ambitions, it also illustrates how his plans could falter, as they have in other arenas, in a muddle of rushed and distorted enforcement, especially at the local level. There has been resistance by parents, worried about their children taking precious time away from academics, as well as fear that splurging on foreign stars diverts money and attention from fostering homegrown talent. The pitfalls in fixing soccer, it turns out, are a bit like those in fixing the economy a desire for quick, flashy success is putting   goals at risk. People?s Daily, the main newspaper of the Communist Party, warned last month of a ?bubble? of reckless spending in Chinese professional soccer that could burst and badly damage the sport. Too many investors had feverish expectations, while some clubs, officials and schools were only going through the motions of developing young players, the newspaper said. ?One of the biggest problems is ? said Cameron Wilson, a Scottish resident of Shanghai who edits Wild East Football, a website that follows the sport in China. ?There are these great plans and ideas. But when it gets down to the   level in the provinces, it?s like people doing their own thing. ? China?s passionate soccer fans would be thrilled to have competitive national teams instead of the lackluster ones they have now. The national men?s team recently placed 83rd in FIFA rankings, just ahead of the Faroe Islands, a remote outcrop of Denmark with fewer than 50, 000 inhabitants, and it is unlikely to win a spot in the 2018 World Cup. The women?s team  ?   the pride of Chinese soccer in past decades  ?   has stumbled. It was   for the Women?s World Cup in 1999 but slipped to 13th in the latest  rankings. ?The national team is a joke,? said Xu Yun, 16, who had come to Workers? Stadium in Beijing to watch his favorite Beijing team clobber a listless opponent from Henan Province. ?I think it will need decades to get it right. It?s not just a question of spending money, it?s attitude. ? For years, the domestic professional game was riddled with corruption, brazen even by China?s   standards. Since   revelations grew into a national scandal in 2009, the worst cheating has been cleaned up. ?It still exists,? Mr. Wilson said. ?Just not so blatantly. ? For Xi, soccer has been a passion since childhood. His trips abroad have included photographs with David Beckham and other soccer celebrities. In Ireland in 2012, he famously had an enthusiastic but seemingly rusty go at kicking a ball. In September, he revisited his old school in Beijing, where he learned to kick and became a fan of the game, according to memoirs of his former teacher. ?Look how healthy I am,? Mr. Xi told young soccer players at the school. ?I laid the basis for that through sports when I was young. ? Private investors have piled into professional soccer, encouraged by Xi?s backing for the game and apparently eager to curry favor with his government. In the main pro trading season last year, the 16 Chinese Super League teams spent about $300 million hiring away promising foreign players, outstripping player spending by the English Premier League by nearly $120 million, according to FIFA TMS, a player transfer data company. Prices in 2017 are likely to go even higher. But Mr. Xi?s focus is on the long game and the next generation of players. His plan calls for 50, 000 schools to have a strong emphasis on soccer by 2025, a leap from 5, 000 in 2015. The number of soccer fields across the country will grow to over 70, 000 by the end of 2020, from under 11, 000. By then, the plan says, 50 million Chinese, including 30 million students, will regularly play soccer. ?Now principals at every school are paying quite a bit more attention to soccer,? said Dai Wei, the athletic director at r. Xi?s old school, the Bayi School. ?That was unthinkable before. ? Yet there is deep cultural resistance, even at Bayi. Some parents discourage their children from committing time to sports, Mr. Dai said, because they have so much homework and face stiff competition on academic exams. While China has excelled at individual sports that demand intense discipline from an early age, the country has not done as well at fostering group sports, where skills like teamwork and improvisation count as much as personal virtuosity. The privately run Evergrande school, the world?s biggest soccer boarding school, says its formula of intense training combined with a solid education could show the way for developing young players. ?As more soccer schools are built, there?ll be more and more kids playing, and the stars will multiply, too,? said Liu Jiangnan, the principal of the school, which opened in 2012. ?I?d guess that in seven or eight years, half the members of the Chinese national squad will come from this school. ? Drawn by such hopes, parents pay up to about $8, 700 a year to send children here, where 24 Spanish coaches oversee training. Students spend 90 minutes a day on drills and also play on weekends. Promising players get scholarships, and children from poorer families get discounts, school officials said. But even here, the children come to the game later than their European and South American counterparts, and they often lack solid grounding in teamwork and tactics, said Sergio Zarco Diaz, a Spanish coach. ?The kids are getting better, year by year,? he said hopefully. But the Evergrande approach is too expensive to be widely copied. Some schools, facing a shortage of coaches and space for fields, have devised their own drills, like soccer gymnastics, in which children stand in lines tossing a ball up, down and around. It may impress visiting officials, but it is scant preparation for the free flow of the game, said Zhang Lu, a widely respected soccer commentator. ?Chinese soccer has failed before through rushing for instant success,? Mr. Zhang said in an interview in Beijing, recalling previous failed efforts to build up the game in the 1980s and 1990s. ?The problem is that everyone?s thinking is still deeply set in traditional ideas. Everyone thinks soccer is just about getting results, competition, training, creating stars. ? Mr. Zhang has instead been encouraging schools to focus on fun and broad participation. That approach gives more children a break from the monotony of the classroom and will eventually bring out more future champions than an elitist,   approach, he argues. Some schools are trying his way. On a recent afternoon, the smog that often covers Beijing lifted and the children of Caoqiao Elementary School rushed onto the fields, shouting and squealing with delight. ?This morning soccer had been canceled because of the smog,? said the principal, Lin Yanling. ?But at midday I notified the kids that it was back on, and they all went crazy with relief. ?"
17889,Jan Hoffman,31/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"The death rate from cervical cancer in the United States is considerably higher than previously estimated and the disparity in death rates between black women and white women is significantly wider, according to a study published Monday in the journal Cancer. The rate at which black American women are dying from the disease is comparable to that of women in many poor developing nations, researchers reported. What makes the findings especially disturbing, said experts not involved in the research, is that when screening guidelines and   monitoring are pursued, cervical cancer is largely preventable. ?This shows that our disparities are even worse than we feared,? said Dr. Kathleen M. Schmeler, an associate professor of gynecologic oncology at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. ?We have screenings that are great, but many women in America are not getting them. And now I have even more concerns going forward, with the?  ?   expected  ?   ?repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which covers screening, and the closing of family planning clinics, which do much of that screening. ? The racial disparity had been noted in earlier studies, but it had been thought to have narrowed because cervical cancer death rates for black women were declining. But this study said that the gap was far greater than believed. In the new analysis, the mortality rate for black women was 10. 1 per 100, 000. For white women, it is 4. 7 per 100, 000. Previous studies had put those figures at 5. 7 and 3. 2. The new rates do not reflect a rise in the number of deaths, which recent estimates put at more than 4, 000 a year in the United States. Instead, the figures come from a   of existing numbers, in an adjusted context. Typically, death rates for cervical cancer are calculated by assessing the number of women who die from a disease against the general population at risk for it. But these epidemiologists, who looked at health data from 2000 to 2012, also excluded women who had had hysterectomies from that larger population. A hysterectomy almost always removes the cervix, and thus the possibility that a woman will develop cervical cancer. ?We don?t include men in our calculation because they are not at risk for cervical cancer and by the same measure, we shouldn?t include women who don?t have a cervix,? said Anne F. Rositch, the lead author and an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. ?If we want to look at how well our programs are doing, we have to look at the women we?re targeting. ? Although the study did not explore reasons for the racial disparity, some doctors said it could reflect unequal access to screening, ability to pursue   test results, and insurance coverage. A recent study in the journal Gynecologic Oncology that looked at 15, 194 patients with advanced cervical cancer found that more than half did not receive treatment considered to be standard of care, and that those patients were more likely to be black and poor. According to the analysis published Monday, the   mortality rates put black American women on par with women living in some underdeveloped countries in Latin America, Asia and Africa, particularly in   Africa. Certainly removing women who had hysterectomies from the data pool had a significant effect. About 20 percent of women in the United States have a hysterectomy, often for problems unrelated to cancer, like excessive bleeding and fibroids, with prevalence higher among black women than white. In years to come, mortality and incidence rates should decline as more women receive HPV vaccines, which prevents many cervical cancers. In recent years, with recognition of the slow progression of the disease, the success of the vaccine and more sophisticated screening tests, guidelines for cervical cancer assessments have shifted. Depending on circumstances, some women need to be screened only every five years. The guidelines suggest that screening end at age 65 for women who have had two or three consecutive negative results in the previous decade. The current study says that the greatest mortality rates hit black women 85 and older. But experts said the new findings did not necessarily point to the need to revisit the upper end of the guidelines. Cervical cancer progresses so slowly, with so many   stages, experts said, that it is highly unlikely that a    woman who had met guidelines? requirements would subsequently develop the disease. But given the rigor of the guidelines and screenings, Dr. Rositch said, why do American women not only still get cervical cancer but die from it? And with such pronounced racial and age divides? Dr. Otis W. Brawley, the chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, said that the new study pointed to inequity of access and good treatment. ?When we look at the difference between black and white, and rich and poor, we find the same disparity,? he said. ?The quality of assessment and   treatment can be different. The question becomes: how do we get adequate preventive care to all people?? Although this study looked at the divide between black and white women, Dr. Schmeler said that it implicitly raised alarms for other poor women of color. Along border towns in Texas, with an overwhelmingly poor, Hispanic population, she said that rates of incidence and death from cervical cancer were considerably higher than national figures. Studies such as this latest one consider death rates from a broad epidemiological perspective statistically, its grimmest news is about older black women. But on the ground, Dr. M. Margaret Kemeny, the director of the Queens Cancer Center of Queens Hospital, a public institution in New York, said she had treated many younger women of color with a diagnosis of cervical cancer. Although the disease is preventable and, if detected early, treatable, Dr. Kemeny?s patients have often never had Pap smears. She recently had to perform total pelvic exenterations on two women, each with recurring cervical cancer, one Chinese, the other Hispanic. She removed the cervix, vagina, rectum and bladder, inserting two ostomy bags, which are worn outside the body to collect urine and stool. ?One was 39,? Dr. Kemeny said, ?and the other was 25. ?"
17612,Jennifer Senior,12/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"Let?s just get this out of the way, shall we? Ayelet Waldman: intemperate tweeter, guerrilla oversharer, provocateur, literary exhibitionist, cyclone of sass. When The New York Times Book Review didn?t select her novel ?Love and Treasure? as one of its 100 Notable Books of 2014, she unleashed a  tweetstorm of hurt. (  excerpt: ?there are MANY books on that notable list with reviews that were NOWHERE near as good as mine. ?) When she announced in a 2005 essay that she loved her husband, the novelist Michael Chabon, more than she loved her children, outraged mothers everywhere clucked and   and when she expressed surprise, the chorus came back  ?   Well, what on earth did you expect? But here?s my question for those who sneer at or   her new memoir about the possible therapeutic value of LSD, ?A Really Good Day: How Microdosing Made a Mega Difference in My Mood, My Marriage, and My Life?: What on earth did you expect? Here is the truth about Ms. Waldman, which complicates matters for those who don?t like her: She has spent many years struggling with punishing, ungovernable moods. Originally, doctors told her she had bipolar II disorder years later, a psychiatrist decided premenstrual dysphoric disorder more closely corresponded with her symptoms, and Ms. Waldman agreed. But whatever it?s called, hers is not a mood disorder of the quiet, novelistic variety. It?s big and operatic, often driving her to do the very things for which she?s been publicly shamed: acting out, picking fights, trawling for affirmation. Just because she doesn?t have a picturesque version of melancholy doesn?t make it any less real or any less deserving of compassion. And after reading ?A Really Good Day,? you understand just why Ms. Waldman might have been willing to experiment to find relief. She?d exhausted her family. She?d exhausted all manner of therapies. And she?d exhausted just about every drug in the pharmacopoeia  ?   including the ones that sound like Spanish dances (Cymbalta, Strattera, Concerta) the ones that look like typing tests (Zoloft, Effexor, Seroquel) and the ones that could well be craters on the moon (Valium, Ambien, Lunesta). Her Ambien dependence proved particularly problematic. When she took too much, she?d have text exchanges with Mr. Chabon that looked like this: Hence Ms. Waldman?s   trial with LSD  ?   10 micrograms every three days. A microdose, as she explains, is anywhere from   to   of what one would find on a   tab of acid. It doesn?t turn the world into a bubbling lava lamp. This dosage, taken at this rate, is ?? according to the psychologist and former psychedelic researcher James Fadiman. Mr. Fadiman?s (admittedly informal, nonrandomized) research suggests that people who follow this protocol simply feel   ?     better. Ms. Waldman wanted to know what something as luxuriously pedestrian as ?better? was like. ?A Really Good Day? is a captain?s log of her    trip. It combines daily reports of her moods with the research she?s done about the history of psychedelics and her extended meditations on drugs and the law. (Before becoming a writer, Ms. Waldman was a federal public defender.) And what does she find? That the experience really is transformative. ?You?ve been much happier,? her younger daughter tells her. ?You?ve been controlling your emotions. Like, when you?re angry, you?re  . ? The reader doesn?t have quite as uniformly positive an experience. Part of the problem is aesthetic: Ms. Waldman has a tendency to slide into the prefab language of psychotherapy or  . (?It is suddenly so obvious that what I need to do is just get out of my own way. ?) Her sense of humor can be unsubtle. (On the weak magic mushrooms she once tried in college: ?It?s possible that all I ate was a handful of dried shiitakes dipped in cow manure. ?) She?s a fan of extended metaphors, and almost no one should be a fan of extended metaphors. They involve beating a dead horse, converting it to glue, and then discovering the glue doesn?t work. If you see what I mean. And her observations can be trite. Her anxious   while meditating  ?   ?Now you?re thinking about thinking! Stop berating yourself for thinking!?  ?   will surprise exactly no one. But then Ms. Waldman will capture you with genuinely brave and human moments, like when she confesses that she yells at people because she enjoys it. Or when she says her talents aren?t considerable enough to earn her a great artist?s tempestuous mood swings. Or expresses guilt that her oldest child has had to bear the brunt of her anger and depression. Her reminiscences about her time defending poor, defenseless clients in Los Angeles are riveting. I am not sure they belong in this book  ?   especially when she talks about the unfairness of our sentencing guidelines (I mean, agreed, but this is neither the time nor the place for  )  ?   but I?d love to see an independent memoir about her legal work one day. Ms. Waldman?s survey of the history and literature of psychotropic drugs is informative, though it can also, on occasion, be too sloppy and loose. She casually drops the phrase ?Alzheimer?  benzos? (short for benzodiazepines, that class of   drugs including Valium and Xanax) without so much as a footnote, and this claim is hardly settled science. She writes that Francis Crick ?reportedly? experimented with LSD when he envisioned the double helix, and then takes it back in a footnote. ?Couldn?t we just pretend it?s true?? she asks. No, we can?t. There are other uncareful moments of this kind, and other undocumented declarations. I mention them not to be picayune, but because writing about drug research is a delicate business, requiring a certain amount of control in one?s voice. You really don?t want readers doubting your authority when you?re making an argument in favor of a maligned and illegal substance. But it?s an argument that needs to be made. As she did with her 2009 essay collection, ?Bad Mother,? which decriminalized ordinary mommy infractions and helped bring a sense of proportion to the messy enterprise of parenting, Ms. Waldman brings a huge dose of compassion and, yes, good sense to ?A Really Good Day. ? Whatever her foibles or stylistic lapses, she makes a persuasive case for the therapeutic use of psychedelics. (Want to be inspired? Read the research on the effects of hallucinogens on dying cancer patients.) As ever, Ms. Waldman is wielding her powers of provocation to goad us into an uncomfortable but necessary conversation. Quibble with her style, her methods, her desire to attract attention. In normalizing the conversation about LSD, she may one day help others feel normal."
17487,Nick Wingfield,9/01/2017,2017,1,technology,"SEATTLE  ?   For a technology to crack the mainstream, there is an unspoken understanding: It shouldn?t make the people who use it want to throw up. And yet there was a reminder, at last week?s International CES trade show in Las Vegas, of how far virtual reality has to go until everyone is ready to fasten   goggles to their faces. At a news conference, Intel, the chip maker, provided virtual reality headsets to about 250 attendees so they could watch a   video from the perspective of sky divers hurtling out of a helicopter in wingsuits. Intel also passed out motion sickness bags to everyone, in case anybody felt inclined to vomit, an unfortunate side effect of turbulent virtual reality experiences for some people. Laura Anderson, an Intel spokeswoman, said the company had provided the bags ?out of an abundance of caution and to be tongue in cheek about our immersive experience. ? No one used the bags, she said. It is time for a reality check for virtual reality, one of the most hyped technologies of last year. Sales of the most capable headsets have been sluggish by most estimates, held back by high costs, a lack of   content, and the complexity and awkwardness of the products. Less expensive mobile headsets that use smartphones as their screens are selling better, but are far more limited in what they can do. Many technologists and early adopters of virtual reality remain unchanged in their conviction that the technology will eventually change how entertainment, including games and movies, is experienced by the masses. The major virtual reality headsets from Oculus, HTC and Sony went on sale to the public only last year, and those who thought they would find a large audience within months of release had unrealistic expectations, virtual reality?s advocates say. ?This is going to be a long slog, as the technology continues to improve, more content becomes available and awareness increases,? said Jan Dawson, an analyst at Jackdaw Research. Virtual reality now appears to be headed for a phase in the evolution of new technologies known as the ?trough of disillusionment,? said Sunny Dhillon, a venture capitalist at Signia Venture Partners, which has invested in virtual reality  . According to the technology research firm Gartner, this stage of the hype cycle for new technologies comes after a period of inflated expectations, but before a phase in which their benefits become commonly accepted. The excitement around virtual reality took a huge leap in March 2014 when Facebook announced it planned to acquire Oculus for $2 billion and the social network?s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, suggested that virtual reality could be the next big thing in technology after mobile. That deal sparked a wave of   creating products for virtual reality and a related technology called augmented reality, which overlays digital imagery on a view of the real world, as seen through smartphones and headsets. Last year, $1. 48 billion was invested in   in that category, compared with $331 million the prior year, estimated Pitchbook, a financial data firm. Many of those   were funded before major headsets went on sale to the public. Entrepreneurs raising money in the future are likely to encounter tougher questions about what kind of use their products are getting. ?All the major headsets have launched  ?   the numbers are coming in,? said Alex Rosenfeld, the founder of Vrideo, a   that acted as a   hub for virtual reality videos. ?You?re going to have some companies here that don?t survive. If the industry is going to continue to attract dollars, there?s going to have to be real numbers. ? Vrideo was one of those that did not make it. Mr. Rosenfeld announced at the end of November that he was shutting the company down. He said investors were skeptical about whether Vrideo could compete against larger players like Google?s YouTube and Facebook not pessimistic about the overall future of virtual reality. The companies that make the major headsets do not report their sales, and all of them said they were pleased with the results so far. SuperData Research, a technology research firm, estimated that Oculus had sold 360, 000 headsets and HTC 450, 000 since their products went on sale in March and June, respectively. Both of those headsets require   PCs with powerful processors. The firm estimated that Sony, which began selling a virtual reality headset in October, has sold about 750, 000. Sony?s headset was seen as a potentially big boost to the virtual reality industry because it is less expensive than rival headsets and relies on a PlayStation 4 console, more than 53 million of which have already been sold. A bundle with the PlayStation VR headset and specialized controllers sells for $500, while comparable bundles from HTC and Oculus sell for just under $800 each. Less expensive Sony and Oculus headsets are available without controllers designed for virtual reality. Still, the Sony sales were fewer than SuperData and others had expected. ?The holidays were pretty disappointing for many in the industry,? said Doug Renert, a venture capitalist with Tandem Capital. ?I?m not all that surprised. ? In a bright spot, Samsung said last week at CES that is had shipped more than five million of its Gear VR headsets, which act as a cradle for a mobile phone, with lenses that create a   image from the phone?s screen. Samsung often runs promotions in which it gives away a headset with the purchase of a Samsung smartphone. Price drops on technology are likely to be a big factor in mainstream acceptance of virtual reality. Starting Monday, a company that makes gaming PCs, CyberPower, will begin selling a $499 computer that can play virtual reality content when used with an Oculus headset. That is hundreds of dollars less than the normal cost. Ergonomic challenges with virtual reality headsets are likely to take longer to overcome. The more powerful headsets must be tethered by thick cables to PCs or consoles, which can tangle up players? legs when these rigs occlude their view of the real world. Some players have come up with clever solutions to this problem by repurposing Ikea lamps to dangle the cables above their heads. At CES, a   called Sixa showed a wireless adapter called Rivvr that eliminates the need for those cables. ?With wireless, V. R. will be ready for the mass market,? said Mykola Minchenko, chief executive of Sixa, which plans to sell its adapter for $200. Mr. Renert, the venture capitalist, said his firm had invested in several   working in virtual reality, including Sixa, despite slow sales of headsets, though the companies are working on technologies in other categories, too. He is confident that virtual reality will one day be a mainstream technology, comparing its evolution to   devices from Apple that were flops and hits. ?We?re not at the Newton stage, but I don?t think we?re at iPhone stage,? Mr. Renert said."
17586,Alan Feuer,11/01/2017,2017,1,crime,"The commander of a Brooklyn police precinct has apologized for remarks he made to the media and at a local community meeting last week in which he played down a recent surge in rapes in his neighborhood, saying most were date rapes, not ?true stranger rapes. ? In a post on Twitter on Monday afternoon, Capt. Peter R. Rose of the 94th Precinct in Greenpoint said, ?I deeply regret the statements I made last week about rape,? adding that his comments ?were not meant to minimize the seriousness of sexual assault. ? ?Every rape whether it is perpetrated by a stranger or someone known to them is fully investigated,? Captain Rose wrote. ?We make no distinction in our response. ? The apology came days after the officer was quoted in an article on the local news website DNAinfo. com about an increase of sexual violence in the neighborhood of Greenpoint, where there were eight reported attacks or attempted attacks in 2015 and 13 last year. Of last year?s cases, three led to arrests, but 10  ?   including two allegedly by taxi drivers on young female passengers  ?   remain unsolved. In the article, which appeared on Friday, Captain Rose told DNAinfo. com that while every rape should be investigated, the spike in reported assaults was ?not a trend that we?re too worried about? because many of them had been committed by acquaintances of the victims. ?If there?s a true stranger rape,? Captain Rose went on, ?a random guy who picks up a stranger off the street, those are the troubling ones. That person has, like, no moral standards. ? Not long after the interview, Captain Rose elaborated on the unsolved sex assault cases at a meeting of the 94th Precinct community council, where he said some of the attacks had involved   of the victims and others hookup apps like Tinder and thus were ?not   rapes where strangers are being dragged off the streets. ? He added that the cases remained open because the victims refused to cooperate with investigators and in some cases left New York for their homes in other states. Both of his comments set off a firestorm of criticism from public officials and advocates for victims of sexual assault who condemned Captain Rose for perpetuating the idea that rapes committed by those who know their victims are somehow less troubling than those committed by strangers. ?Rape is rape,? Eric Phillips, a spokesman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, said in remarks published on Friday in a separate article on DNAinfo. ?The crime merits no moral qualification and does not involve shades of criminality or degrees of danger. ? The same day, Stephen Davis, a spokesman for the New York Police Department, issued a statement saying, ?Captain Rose?s comments did not properly explain the complexity of issues involved with investigating rape complaints. ? The statement added: ?All complaints of rape and other types of sexual crimes are taken seriously whether they are committed by domestic partners, acquaintances or strangers. ? Then on Monday, the city?s new police commissioner, James P. O?Neill, wrote a rare opinion article in The Daily News in which he called Captain Rose?s comment ?insensitive? and said that they had ?left the misleading and inaccurate impression that the N. Y. P. D. treats these types of cases differently. ? Commissioner O?Neill continued: ?We do not, either as a matter of policy or practice. ? In his article, the commissioner also said that only some rape victims report their attacks to the police, and he detailed a number of steps that the department has taken in recent years to change that. Those steps, he said, included collaborating with victims? advocates, sponsoring poster contests on college campuses to encourage students to report rapes and assaults, and creating a hotline so that victims can directly call the detectives who investigate such crimes. Commissioner O?Neill did not say whether Captain Rose would face any disciplinary action. Reports of sexual assault have greatly decreased in the last 20 years. Quoting federal crime statistics from 2010 to 2014,  the Rape Abuse Incest National Network said seven in 10 rapes were committed by someone known to the victim. That was the argument of two dozen demonstrators who gathered in the snow on Tuesday outside the 94th Precinct station house to protest Captain Rose?s statements, with signs reading ?Take Rape Seriously? and ?Rape Is Always a Crime. ? ?It is an outrageous idea that acquaintance rape matters less  ?   it isn?t just bad policy, it?s bad law enforcement,? Jane Manning, the director of advocacy for Women?s Justice NOW. ?Most rapists target women they know because they?ll have a better chance to get away with it by claiming consent. ?The idea that acquaintance matters less is pervasive in our culture,? Ms. Manning added. ?Captain Rose was unfortunately saying something out loud that many, many people already believe. ?"
18320,Richard Sandomir,2/02/2017,2017,2,entertainment,"Emmanuelle Riva, whose performance in the antiwar film ?Hiroshima Mon Amour? in 1959 placed her at the center of the French New Wave  ?   and who, more than 50 years later, became the oldest person nominated for an Academy Award for best lead actor or actress, as a woman debilitated by strokes in ?Amour?  ?   died on Friday in Paris. She was 89. The cause was cancer, her agent, Anne Alvares Correa, said. ?Hiroshima Mon Amour,? directed by Alain Resnais and written by Marguerite Duras, was one of the first internationally acclaimed films to emerge from the French New Wave, a movement that rejected classic cinematic storytelling with youthful irreverence. In the United States it was an   hit. ?With his first feature film,? Andrew Sarris wrote in The Village Voice, ?Resnais has made the most important contribution to realizable film aesthetics since ?Citizen Kane. ?? The movie opens with Ms. Riva, playing an actress who has come to Hiroshima to make a film promoting peace, and her   Eiji Okada, as an architect, in a lovers? embrace. Their faces are unseen and their limbs are covered in what appears to be ash, as if from a nuclear blast, that is then washed away. They speak in  . Ms. Riva says she has seen evidence of the bomb?s effects in a hospital and a museum. But Mr. Okada rebukes her, over and over: ?You saw nothing in Hiroshima. Nothing. ? She reveals tortured memories of an affair she had during World War II in her native Nevers, France, with a German soldier. Her living and dead lovers become linked  ?   as do the horrors of Nevers and Hiroshima. Looking back at it nearly a   later, the critic Michael Koresky said that Ms. Riva?s performance was ?responsible for much of the emotional heft? of the film and that ?the range of feelings that run across Riva?s face is perhaps the most unforgettable element. ? Ms. Riva sensed at the time that ?Hiroshima Mon Amour? might turn out to be the creative peak of a film career that had just begun. ?I think I was particularly blessed because I put my trust in Alain Resnais,? she told an interviewer at the Cannes Film Festival in 1959, when the film was shown there. But, she added: ?I feel like I might be a disappointment after this, because Resnais pushed me to excel. He made me reach certain heights. ? Paulette Germaine Riva was born on Feb. 24, 1927, in Chenimenil, in northeastern France, and grew up in nearby Remiremont. Her father, Ren? Alfred Riva, was a sign writer her mother, the former Jeanne Fernande Nourdin, was a seamstress. An only child, she never married and had no children. Ms. Riva had wanted to act since she was a child, she later said, but felt that her ambition was circumscribed by her family?s modest life in a rural village. She began performing in regional theater, but also trained as a seamstress before she entered acting school in Paris in her  . ?If I had failed, I?d be dead,? she told the French newspaper Lib?ration. ?I did not have a second to lose. ? Her first role on the Paris stage was in Shaw?s ?Arms and the Man? in 1954. Five years later, Mr. Resnais cast her as the nameless actress in ?Hiroshima Mon Amour. ? In the decades that followed, Ms. Riva toggled from movies to stage work to television series. She distinguished herself in movies like ?L?on Morin, Priest? (1961) but she never had another role as sensational as the one she played in ?Hiroshima Mon Amour. ? ?I refused as many offers as I accepted,? she told The New York Times in 2013. ?I refused commercial roles. But it was wrong, I have been too extreme, and I don?t say it was good. ? Then the Austrian director Michael Haneke  ?   who told The Times in 2012 that as a young man he had been ?captivated? by Ms. Riva?s performance in ?Hiroshima Mon Amour?  ?   asked her to audition for ?Amour. ? ?Clearly he wanted to see me again after all these years,? she told The Guardian in 2013. ?I was in his head, perhaps. ? In ?Amour,? Ms. Riva played Anne, a retired music teacher who is failing mentally and physically. Her husband, Georges, played by   Trintignant, devotedly cares for her. Writing in The Times, Manohla Dargis called them ?two titans of French cinema. ?  In an interview with the entertainment news website TheWrap. com, she said that Mr. Haneke had only one direction for her as she worked with Mr. Trintignant. ?We were doing a scene,? she recalled, ?and he said, ?It?s very nice  ?   very sweet, very tender  ?   but it?s too tender. No sentimentality. From here on in, no sentimentality.? This was the key that opened the horizon of the film. Once I heard that, it became much more clear. ? ?Amour? won the Academy Award for best   film. Ms. Riva did not win the Oscar for best actress  ?   she lost to Jennifer Lawrence for ?Silver Linings Playbook?  ?   but she won the C?sar, the French version of the Oscar, and a Bafta film award, from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, for the role. After the release of ?Amour,? she said in an interview with The Times, she received a letter from a friend who wondered how she had aged ?so tragically in front of our eyes. ? She explained:  ?Anne is another person, it isn?t me. It is a journey into someone else, someone I?m not. ?"
17839,Vanessa Friedman,26/05/2017,2017,5,politics,"WASHINGTON  ?   In the end, she checked every box. Elegant, unexpected dress? Check. Unknown designer elevated to overnight sensation? Check. New York brand? Check. Implicit message about cooperation and embracing the melting pot? Check. When Melania Trump took the stage with her husband, President Trump, on Friday night for the inaugural balls, she demonstrated that, while she may have been out of the spotlight since the election, she hasn?t been sticking her head in the sand. She has been closely studying the vernacular of first lady dress. In an architectural    white crepe column with a thin burgundy ribbon as a belt, a high slit and a gazar wave curving from sleeve to hip and then down the skirt, she looked  ?   especially when compared with the younger generation of Trump women, most of whom opted for   sparkling princess gowns  ?   understated and adult. Not remotely mired in the 1980s, though her husband?s look and rhetoric may be. And despite rampant speculation about the designer behind the dress, she cannily managed to surprise the entire fashion world. The gown was, according to a statement from her office, a ?collaboration? between Mrs. Trump and the designer Herv? Pierre, a Frenchman who moved to New York in the early 1990s and eventually became creative director of Carolina Herrera, where he and Mrs. Trump met and where he worked on clothes for Laura Bush and Michelle Obama, though largely behind the scenes. He left that post last February. This is his first major dress under his own name (he does not yet have a   collection in that context). It will eventually join the exhibit of first ladies gowns at the Smithsonian stretching back to Helen Taft in 1909. Though rumors had surfaced earlier in the week that Mrs. Trump was working with Chanel?s creative director Karl Lagerfeld on her gown, in the end she used the opportunity  ?   and indeed, her entire inaugural wardrobe  ?   to do what her husband, standing on the steps of the Capitol building, said they would do: ?follow two simple rules: Buy American and Hire American. ? After over 20 years in this country, Mr. Pierre counts. Indeed, with one notable exception  ?   Kellyanne Conway?s       coat at the   which looked like she might have borrowed it off a toy soldier (it was her ?Trump revolution wear? she told reporters) but in fact turned out to be a $3, 600 design from the Italian brand Gucci  ?   the inaugural weekend overall was a series of America First fashion moments, literally and metaphorically. And not just when it came to the women. There has been a lot of speculation over whether the office of president will change Mr. Trump  ?   encourage moderation of his Twitter account, for example, or his language. As yet that is unclear, but it does appear to have changed how his family dresses. On Friday the president wore an overcoat and shirt to the   said to be by Brooks Brothers, the American men?s wear brand that outfitted 39 presidents before him. Lincoln, Grant, Chester Arthur, Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson and Barack Obama wore Brooks Brothers for their   ceremonies, and Mr. Obama even wore his overcoat again on Friday when he stood with Mr. Trump. For a man who often overtly rejected the Washington establishment and what came before in his speech, it was nevertheless a nod to tradition and history. The day before, Melania Trump (who during the campaign tended toward European brands) stepped off the military jet that brought the Trumps to Washington for a   ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery in a strict,     coat by Norisol Ferrari, a small, independent New York designer who described herself to WWD as a ?  minority woman. ? Then, that evening at the donors? black tie dinner, the first lady wore a   nude sequined gown by Reem Acra, the   designer based in New York. And Ivanka Trump wore three different outfits from Oscar de la Renta, a   name of New York Fashion Week: a   coat and matching dress to Arlington a    gown to the donor?s dinner and a white pantsuit to the  . (Oscar de la Renta himself dressed both Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush for their husbands? second inaugural balls the brand is something of an inaugural  .) For the balls, she donned Carolina Herrera. It was when Mrs. Trump wore a Ralph Lauren     cashmere dress and coat to the Inauguration Day festivities, however, that it became indubitable that something strategic was going on. It is not just because Mr. Lauren is a designer who has built an empire on the mythology of the American dream, or because he has outfitted the U. S. Olympic team and donated $13 million to help restore the   Banner at the National Museum of American History. And it is not because he had dressed four first ladies before, crossing political parties in service to the role. It is because the dress and coat he made for Mrs. Trump, in shape and shade, created an image that was redolent of nothing so much as Jacqueline Kennedy at her Camelot inaugural, with all the new beginnings and freighted history that implies. Whatever you think of the reality of that connection  ?   and on social media, there was a lot of verbal    ?   the outfit oozed appropriateness. If it looked like something of a first lady costume, and it did, it also suggested that Mrs. Trump had studied up and was prepared to assume the starring role she played later in the evening. Just as Ivanka Trump?s trouser suit, which was designed by Fernando Garcia, one half of the new young creative duo at Oscar de la Renta, seemed a sign of the unofficial role she has often suggested she will pursue: women?s advocate. White pantsuits, after all, became famous over the summer when Hillary Clinton wore one, also by Ralph Lauren, to accept the Democratic nomination for president, at least in part in acknowledgment of the suffragists, who chose white as one of their signature colors. Later, the white outfits were adopted as a uniform of sorts by   women as they went to the polls. It was thus a fairly pointed (and, to some, poignant) moment when Mrs. Clinton appeared in a final white Ralph Lauren pantsuit to accompany her husband to the inauguration  ?   a suit that had been made as part of her campaign collaboration with Mr. Lauren, but never worn. And it was probably not by chance that Ms. Trump selected a similar look. The politics of clothing may be subtle, and may strike some as frivolous, but that doesn?t mean they aren?t a requisite part of the pageantry that surrounds the presidency  ?   especially on a day with more photo opportunities than speeches. They paint a picture of the family that now represents the country, of their ambitions, goals and values, at a moment when the world is watching. This time, the brush strokes swirled: not with accessibility, but with aspiration, and nationalism. A case of the emperor?s new clothes, or a harbinger of things to come? We?ll have to keep looking to find out."
18147,Alan Blinder and Matt Apuzzo,1/02/2017,2017,2,business,"ATLANTA  ?   As a young prosecutor in the late 1990s, Sally Q. Yates sat at a conference table with a former sheriff and began picking away at his story. With an F. B. I. agent watching, Ms. Yates soon had the lawman in knots about a deposition. ?I watched him as she broke him down, and he confessed that he had lied under oath,? the agent, Oliver G. Halle, now retired, recalled on Tuesday. ?She can be very disarming, but underneath that disarming appearance is a woman who knows how to fight. ? As acting attorney general, Ms. Yates picked the fight of her life on Monday when she ordered the Justice Department not to defend President Trump?s executive order blocking refugees and restricting immigration to the United States. Ms. Yates became convinced, based on the president?s own statements, that he had intended to unlawfully single out Muslims, senior officials said. ?We have comments from the president about what this is supposed to do,? Ms. Yates said in one meeting on Monday, according to two people involved in the discussions. She later added, ?The intent was clear from the face of it. ? Ms. Yates, 56, was swiftly fired. Before she even finished packing up her office, she had become a hero to many Democrats, the face of a simmering resistance inside the government to Mr. Trump?s administration. Her firing was a politically divisive turn in a career that had, until now, earned her bipartisan praise. ?She will be a hero of the American people, a hero of what?s right,? Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, said in 2015 at Ms. Yates?s confirmation hearing. ?She?ll call them like she sees them, and she will be fair, and she will be just. ? While Ms. Yates was a reliably liberal voice in the Justice Department on issues of civil rights, criminal justice and sentencing, she worked her way up as a career prosecutor in Atlanta under political appointees from both parties. A native Georgian, she led prosecutions against some of the highest profile defendants in Atlanta, including former Mayor Bill Campbell, a Democrat who was accused of racketeering and tax fraud, and Eric Robert Rudolph, who set bombs at a park during the 1996 Olympic Games, a gay nightclub and two Southern abortion clinics. She also took on the leaders of an Atlanta suburb who refused to allow construction of a mosque. The Justice Department sued, and the city reversed itself. ?Religious freedom requires that local government decisions impacting the exercise of that freedom be free of discrimination,? Ms. Yates said at the time. When Ms. Yates, who declined to comment on Tuesday, became deputy attorney general in 2015, she told colleagues that she had no intention of merely being a caretaker. ?We?re going to run through the tape,? she often said. In Washington, her outgoing personality made her a counterpoint to her more reserved boss, Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch. At times that made Ms. Yates the face of the Justice Department in ways that caused tension with Ms. Lynch?s staff. Ms. Yates was regarded as professionally ambitious, though she has told friends that she has no interest in running for political office. Last year, Ms. Yates and Ms. Lynch earned the ire of Democrats  ?   including many in the department  ?   for not intervening to prohibit the F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, from sending a letter to Congress in the final days of the presidential campaign. The letter raised the prospect of new and potentially damaging evidence against Hillary Clinton related to an investigation that had been closed. Nothing came of the new evidence, and Mrs. Clinton?s team says the letter cost her the presidency. Her supporters argued that Justice Department leaders were too timid to stand up to Mr. Comey. Mr. Trump?s executive order prompted a new challenge for Ms. Yates, who was serving until the Senate confirmed a new attorney general. The Justice Department?s Office of Legal Counsel had reviewed and signed off on the order, but Ms. Yates believed that the department had to also consider the president?s intent, which she said appeared aimed at singling out people based on religion. Mr. Trump had promised to do as much. His campaign website still calls for a ?total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country?s representatives can figure out what is going on. ? After the decision was announced, one of his advisers, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, said in an interview that Mr. Trump had wanted a Muslim ban but needed ?the right way to do it legally. ? Mr. Trump then said in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network that Christian refugees would be given priority for entry visas to the United States. In meetings on Monday, some in the department said it should defend the order, as it normally does. Others disagreed. Prominent lawyers echoed that debate on Tuesday. Some former Justice Department officials, like Martin Lederman, praised Ms. Yates?s decision. Ms. Lynch said ?her courageous leadership embodies the highest traditions of the Department of Justice. ? But others, like Jack Goldsmith, said she should have either defended the president?s order or resigned. George J. Terwilliger III, a former deputy attorney general who, like Ms. Yates, served briefly as acting attorney general, said that Ms. Yates had made herself and the Justice Department ?look blatantly political. ? Ms. Yates considered resigning, four current and former Justice Department officials said, but she concluded that doing so would only defer a difficult decision to a temporary successor. That dilemma was foreshadowed two years ago in her confirmation hearing, when Senator Jeff Sessions, the Alabama Republican who is poised to become the next attorney general, questioned whether Ms. Yates had the independent streak needed to be the Justice Department?s second in command. ?If the views the president wants to execute are unlawful, should the attorney general or the deputy attorney general say no?? Mr. Sessions asked. ?I believe the attorney general or deputy attorney general has an obligation to follow the law and Constitution and give their independent legal advice to the president,? Ms. Yates replied. Shortly after 9 p. m. on Monday, roughly three hours after she ordered department lawyers not to defend the president?s position, a White House courier arrived with a copy of her dismissal letter. ?Dear Deputy Attorney General Yates,? said the letter, which was signed by John DeStefano, an assistant to Mr. Trump. ?I am informing you that the president has removed you from the office of Deputy Attorney General of the United States. ?"

While Mr. Klarman has long kept a low public profile, he is considered a giant within investment circles. He is often compared to Warren Buffett, and The Economist magazine once described him as ?The Oracle of Boston,? where Baupost is based. For good measure, he is one of the very few hedge managers Mr. Buffett has publicly praised. In his letter, Mr. Klarman sets forth a countervailing view to the euphoria that has buoyed the stock market since Mr. Trump took office, describing ?perilously high valuations. ? ?Exuberant investors have focused on the potential benefits of stimulative tax cuts, while mostly ignoring the risks from   protectionism and the erection of new trade barriers,? he wrote. ?President Trump may be able to temporarily hold off the sweep of automation and globalization by cajoling companies to keep jobs at home, but bolstering inefficient and uncompetitive enterprises is likely to only temporarily stave off market forces,? he continued. ?While they might be popular, the reason the U. S. long ago abandoned protectionist trade policies is because they not only don?t work, they actually leave society worse off. ? In particular, Mr. Klarman appears to believe that investors have become hypnotized by all the talk of   policies, without considering the full ramifications. He worries, for example, that Mr. Trump?s stimulus efforts ?could prove quite inflationary, which would likely shock investors. ? And he appears deeply concerned about a swelling national debt that he suggests could undermine the economy?s growth over the long term. ?The Trump tax cuts could drive government deficits considerably higher,? Mr. Klarman wrote. ?The large 2001 Bush tax cuts, for example, fueled income inequality while triggering huge federal budget deficits. Rising interest rates alone would balloon the federal deficit, because interest payments on the massive outstanding government debt would skyrocket from today?s artificially low levels. ? Much of Mr. Klarman?s anxiety seems to emanate from Mr. Trump?s leadership style. He described it this way: ?The erratic tendencies and overconfidence in his own wisdom and judgment that Donald Trump has demonstrated to date are inconsistent with strong leadership and sound  . ? He also linked this point  ?   which is a fair one  ?   to what ?Trump style? means for Mr. Klarman?s constituency and others. ?The big picture for investors is this: Trump is high volatility, and investors generally abhor volatility and shun uncertainty,? he wrote. ?Not only is Trump shockingly unpredictable, he?s apparently deliberately so he says it?s part of his plan. ? While Mr. Klarman clearly is hoping for the best, he warned, ?If things go wrong, we could find ourselves at the beginning of a lengthy decline in dollar hegemony, a rapid rise in interest rates and inflation, and global angst. ? Mr. Klarman is a registered independent and has given money to politicians from both parties. He has donated to Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Marco Rubio, John McCain and Rudolph W. Giuliani as well as Hillary Clinton, Cory Booker and Mark Warner. While he has remained largely outside the public eye, Mr. Klarman surprised some of his friends and peers over the summer when he issued a statement after Mr. Trump criticized a judge over his Mexican heritage, saying he planned to support Mrs. Clinton: ?His words and actions over the last several days are so shockingly unacceptable in our diverse and democratic society that it is simply unthinkable that Donald Trump could become our president. ? In his recent letter, he explained for the first time his decision to say something publicly. ?Despite my preference to stay out of the media,? he wrote, ?I?ve taken the view that each of us can be bystanders, or we can be upstanders. I choose upstander. ? From the letter, it is hard to divine exactly how Mr. Klarman is investing his fund?s money. His office declined to comment on the letter, which I obtained from a source. His fund currently has more than 30 percent of its funds in cash. He has lost money in only three of the past 34 years. What investors say publicly and what they do in the markets can be different things. Mr. Buffett campaigned publicly against Mr. Trump, but he has nevertheless invested in the market since his election  ?   about $12 billion, according to a recent disclosure. George Soros, who also actively campaigned against Mr. Trump, bet  ?   wrongly so far  ?   that the stock market would fall he lost about $1 billion. Most hedge funds have found themselves on the losing side of trades over the past several years, a point Mr. Klarman addressed in his letter. Noting that hedge fund returns have underperformed the indexes  ?   he mentioned that hedge funds had returned only 23 percent from 2010 to 2015, compared with 108 percent for the Standard  Poor?s index  ?   he blamed the influx of money into the industry. ?With any asset class, when substantial new money flows in, the returns go down,? Mr. Klarman wrote. ?No surprise, then, that as money poured into hedge funds, overall returns have soured. ? He continued, ?To many, hedge funds have come to seem like a failed product. ? The lousy performance among hedge funds and the potential for them to go out of business or consolidate, he suggests, may become an opportunity. Perhaps the most distinctive point he makes  ?   at least that finance geeks will appreciate  ?   is what he says is the irony that investors now ?have gotten excited about   index funds and exchange traded funds (E. T. F. s) that mimic various market or sector indices. ? He says he sees big trouble ahead in this area  ?   or at least the potential for investors in individual stocks to profit. ?One of the perverse effects of increased indexing and E. T. F. activity is that it will tend to ?lock in? today?s relative valuations between securities,? Mr. Klarman wrote. ?When money flows into an index fund or   E. T. F. the manager generally buys into the securities in an index in proportion to their current market capitalization (often to the capitalization of only their public float, which interestingly adds a layer of distortion, disfavoring companies with large insider, strategic, or state ownership),? he wrote. ?Thus today?s   companies are likely to also be tomorrow?s, regardless of merit, with less capital in the hands of active managers to potentially correct any mispricings. ? To Mr. Klarman, ?stocks outside the indices may be cast adrift, no longer attached to the valuation grid but increasingly off of it. ? ?This should give   value investors a distinct advantage,? he wrote. ?The inherent irony of the efficient market theory is that the more people believe in it and correspondingly shun active management, the more inefficient the market is likely to become. ? How Mr. Klarman wants investors to behave in the age of Trump remains an open question. But here?s a hint: At the top of his letter, he included three quotations. One was attributed to Thomas Jefferson: ?In matters of style, swim with the current in matters of principle, stand like a rock. ?"
18062,Peter Baker,30/01/2017,2017,1,crime,"WASHINGTON  ?   Travelers were stranded around the world, protests escalated in the United States and anxiety rose within President Trump?s party on Sunday as his order closing the nation to refugees and people from certain predominantly Muslim countries provoked a crisis just days into his administration. The White House pulled back on part of Mr. Trump?s temporary ban on visitors from seven countries by saying that it would not apply to those with green cards granting them permanent residence in the United States. By the end of the day, the Department of Homeland Security formally issued an order declaring such legal residents exempt from the order. But the recalibration did little to reassure critics at home or abroad who saw the president?s order as a retreat from traditional American values. European leaders denounced the order, and some Republican lawmakers called on Mr. Trump to back down. As of Sunday evening, officials said no one was being held at American airports, although lawyers said they believed that dozens were still being detained. More than any of the myriad moves Mr. Trump has made in his frenetic opening days in office, the immigration order has quickly come to define his emerging presidency as one driven by a desire for decisive action even at the expense of deliberate process or coalition building. It has thrust the    administration into its first constitutional conflict, as multiple courts have intervened to block aspects of the order, and into its broadest diplomatic incident, with overseas allies objecting. The White House was left to defend what seemed to many government veterans like a slapdash process. Aides to Mr. Trump insisted they had consulted for weeks with relevant officials, but the head of the customs and border service in the Obama administration, who resigned on inauguration day, said the incoming president?s team never talked with him about it. White House officials blamed what they portrayed as a hyperventilating news media for the confusion and said the order had been successfully carried out. Only about 109 travelers were detained in the first 24 hours, out of the 325, 000 who typically enter the United States in a day, they said. As of Sunday evening, the Department of Homeland Security said 392 green card holders had been granted waivers to enter. That did not count many visitors who remained overseas now unable to travel. Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, said Mr. Trump simply did what he had promised on the campaign trail and would not gamble with American lives. ?We?re not willing to be wrong on this subject,? he said on ?Face the Nation? on CBS. ?President Trump is not willing to take chances on this subject. ? The order bars entry to refugees from anywhere in the world for 120 days and from Syria indefinitely. It blocks any visitors for 90 days from seven designated countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The Department of Homeland Security initially said the order would bar green card holders from those seven countries from returning to the United States. With thousands of protesters chanting outside his White House windows and thronging the streets of Washington and other cities, Mr. Trump late on Sunday defended his order. ?To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting,? he said in a written statement. ?This is not about religion  ?   this is about terror and keeping our country safe. ? He noted that the seven countries were identified by former President Barack Obama?s administration as sources of terrorism and that his order did not affect citizens from dozens of other predominantly Muslim countries. ?We will again be issuing visas to all countries once we are sure we have reviewed and implemented the most secure policies over the next 90 days,? he said. Mr. Trump expressed sympathy for victims of the   civil war in Syria. ?I have tremendous feeling for the people involved in this horrific humanitarian crisis in Syria,? he said. ?My first priority will always be to protect and serve our country, but as president, I will find ways to help all those who are suffering. ? While Mr. Trump denied that his action focused on religion, the first iteration of his plan during his presidential campaign was framed as a temporary ban on all Muslim visitors. As late as Sunday morning, he made clear that his concern was for Christian refugees, and part of his order gives preferential treatment to Christians who try to enter the United States from   nations. In a Twitter post on Sunday morning, Mr. Trump deplored the killing of Christians in the Middle East without noting the killings of Muslims, who have been killed in vastly greater numbers in Iraq, Syria and elsewhere. ?Christians in the Middle East have been executed in large numbers,? he wrote. ?We cannot allow this horror to continue!? His order, however, resulted in a second day of uncertainty at American airports. The American Civil Liberties Union said it was investigating reports that officials were not complying with court orders in New York, Boston, Seattle, Los Angeles and Chicago. New York?s attorney general sent a letter to federal authorities demanding a list of all individuals detained at Kennedy International Airport. The Department of Homeland Security said on Sunday evening that it was ?in compliance with judicial orders. ? Still, at Dulles International Airport outside Washington, even the arrival of four Democratic members of Congress did not prompt customs officers to acknowledge whether they were holding anyone or provide lawyers access to anyone detained. The lawmakers arrived after 3 p. m. and were rebuffed by police officers when they tried to enter the Customs and Border Protection offices at the airport. Representative Gerry Connolly, Democrat of Virginia, said he was told to call the main office of the agency in Washington. His staff got a legislative liaison from the customs service on the phone, and ?they said we?ll put you in touch with the deputy commissioner,? Mr. Connolly said. ?I said that?s not acceptable,? he continued. ?We want to talk to the person in charge of operations at Dulles Airport. That?s where the problem is, and that?s where the federal judicial ruling is applicable. ? The clash over the order provoked emotional responses. At a news conference, Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leader from New York, choked up as he vowed to ?claw, scrap and fight with every fiber of my being until these orders are overturned. ? The mayors of New York, Chicago and Boston spoke out, as well. In Dallas, Mayor Mike Rawlings personally offered regrets to four released detainees at   Worth Airport. ?We have wished them welcome, and we have apologized from the depths of our heart,? he said. Chelsea Clinton joined a protest in New York. The order roiled relations with America?s traditional allies in Europe and the Middle East. The spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said she ?is convinced that the resolute fight against terrorism does not justify blanket suspicion on grounds of origin or belief. ? Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, who met with Mr. Trump in Washington on Friday and has sought to forge a friendship with him, initially declined to comment on the policy on Saturday when pressed by reporters during a stop in Turkey. But under pressure from opposition politicians, her spokesman later said the British government did ?not agree with this kind of approach. ? The matter was especially sensitive in Muslim countries, and Mr. Trump spoke by telephone on Sunday with King Salman of Saudi Arabia and Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi. White House statements on the calls said they discussed the fight against terrorism but did not say whether they discussed the immigration order, which did not include their countries. In Washington, protesters gathered by the thousands outside Mr. Trump?s front lawn to denounce his order and show solidarity with Muslim Americans. ?Shame,? they chanted, hoisting homemade signs toward the executive mansion, where Mr. Trump was scheduled to host a private screening of the movie ?Finding Dory. ? ?No hate, no fear,? they added later. ?Refugees are welcome here. ? Security fencing and reviewing stands still in place from the inauguration prevented the crowd from getting more than a couple hundred yards away from the building, but did not stop crowds from swelling through the afternoon, when protesters departed to march to Capitol Hill. Some Republicans grew increasingly alarmed by the backlash to the order. ?This executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country,? Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said in a statement. ?That is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security. ? Some conservative donors also criticized the decision. Officials with the political network overseen by Charles G. and David H. Koch, the billionaire conservative activists, released a statement on Sunday criticizing Mr. Trump?s handling of the issue. ?We believe it is possible to keep Americans safe without excluding people who wish to come here to contribute and pursue a better life for their families,? said Brian Hooks, a chairman of the Kochs? donor network. ?The travel ban is the wrong approach and will likely be counterproductive. ? Senator Bob Corker, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said the order was ?poorly implemented? and urged the president to ?make appropriate revisions. ? Other Republicans were more circumspect. Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, said the issue would be decided by the courts. Mr. Trump fired back at Mr. McCain and Mr. Graham on Twitter. ?They are sadly weak on immigration,? he wrote. ?Senators should focus their energies on ISIS, illegal immigration and border security instead of always looking to start World War III. ?"
18265,Kimiko de Freytas-Tamura,4/02/2017,2017,2,entertainment,"Popcorn munching. Soup slurping. Nose sniffling. Or, simply, breathing. Ever wonder why some ordinary sounds drive you crazy? It?s called misophonia, a mysterious affliction in which seemingly harmless sounds unleash anger, anxiety and, in some cases, panic attacks in some people. If you?re one of them, neuroscientists at Newcastle University in Britain say they may have found an explanation for what ails you. In a report on the latest study published Thursday in the journal Current Biology, the neuroscientists say that brain scans of misophonia sufferers show that particular sounds, like eating and drinking, cause the part of their brain that processes emotions, the anterior insular cortex, to go into overdrive. That region in sufferers was also connected differently, compared to normal brains, to the amygdala and the hippocampus, areas that are involved in recalling past experiences, said Dr. Sukhbinder Kumar, the lead researcher from the Institute of Neuroscience at Newcastle University. ?We think that misophonia may be heavily connected to recalling past memories, because people with misophonia have had very bad experiences,? he said in a phone interview Friday. The research opens up the possibilities of future therapy for those afflicted with misophonia, a term coined by the American scientists Pawel and Margaret Jastreboff in 2001. A survey of nearly 200 misophonia sufferers showed that the average age at which they first became aware of the condition was 12, Dr. Kumar said. ?When they hear these sounds, it?s like their attention is completely absorbed by the sounds, and they can?t do anything else,? he said. ?They?re triggering a recall. ? For the study, the team used an M. R. I. to measure the brain activities of 42 people with and without misophonia while they were listening to a range of noises. The sounds were categorized into neutral ones like rain unpleasant sounds like a crying baby and trigger sounds that were mostly linked to eating, chewing, drinking and breathing. When exposed to the noises, those with misophonia showed brain activities different from those without the condition. ?The most dominant reaction is anger and anxiety, not disgust,? Dr. Kumar said. But why those sounds, and not others, trigger such averse reactions remains a mystery, he said. The exact number of misophonia sufferers in the world is unknown, he said, because it was only recently diagnosed as a condition. The affliction can be so acute in some people that they can?t stand living with their own families. Olana   29, of Kent, England, was just 8 when family meals became a real chore. ?The noise of my family eating forced me to retreat to my own bedroom for meals,? she told the team at Newcastle University. ?I can only describe it as a feeling of wanting to punch people in the face when I heard the noise of them eating. ? Dr. Kumar said in a news release,?My hope is to identify the brain signature of the trigger sounds  ?   those signatures can be used for treatment such as for   for example, where people can   their reactions by looking at what kind of brain activity is being produced. ? But the study?s findings will come as some relief to misophonia sufferers and reassure some who question the condition?s validity, he added. ?This study demonstrates the critical brain changes as further evidence to convince a skeptical medical community that this is a genuine disorder. ?"
17362,Shivani Vora,7/01/2017,2017,1,lifestyle,"Whether the music to your ears is pop, classical, jazz, country or another type of tune altogether, the rhythms of 2017 have you covered. Dance the days and nights away at Summerfest, June 28 to July 9 in Milwaukee, an   bonanza that includes 800 acts spread out across 11 stages at Henry Maier Festival Park on Lake Michigan. The Red Hot Chili Peppers and Pink are among the headline performers this year, the festival?s 50th, but other genres such as   classic rock, Latin and reggae are also represented. The Monterey International Pop Festival, June 16 to 18 in Monterey, Calif. is also turning 50 this year, and celebrating in style, on the same weekend and at the same location  ?   the Monterey County Fair and Events Center  ?   where the original festival was held in 1967. That event helped establish the careers of many legendary musicians, including Jimi Hendrix, the Who and the Grateful Dead, and this year, over the course of three days, nine bands will take the stage to pay tribute to them. In Monte Carlo, it?s all jazz all the time at the 12th annual   Jazz Festival (November and December, exact dates to be determined) featuring performances by the world?s top jazz players such as Manu Katch?, the drummer and singer, the bassist Richard Bona, and Ibrahim Maalouf, the trumpet player, all of whom were guests in 2016. The heart of the action takes place at the Op?ra Garnier   an ornate   building, but the shows spill over into the Casino de   and glitzy oceanfront bars. Mellower sounds are in store on the Caribbean island of Mustique from Jan. 18 to Feb. 1, at the Mustique Blues Festival, a   secret among discerning fans. The event unfolds over nearly two weeks at the beachside Basil?s Bar, where spectators can sip sundowners while listening to the music of renowned blues players from around the world, including the San   guitarist and singer Joe Louis Walker. Festivalgoers should be on the lookout for other attendees, both famous and not, giving impromptu shows Mick Jagger and Michael Kors have jumped on stage in past years to belt out the blues before a stunned crowd. On the classical music scene, a prestigious orchestra celebrates a big birthday while another is born. In Austria, the Vienna Philharmonic is marking its 175th anniversary with more than 100 concerts throughout the year, including the free and   Summer Night Concert Sch?nbrunn on May 25, in the Baroque gardens of Vienna?s Sch?nbrunn Palace, and four opera productions at the Salzburg Festival in Salzburg from July 21 to Aug. 30, most notably ?Aida,? in which the Russian superstar soprano Anna Netrebko will sing the title role. And in Germany, Hamburg anticipates a January opening for the Elbphilharmonie, a striking new building set atop a former warehouse, with a glass facade, a scalloped roofline and two concert halls. Festivities at the new cultural landmark will unfold all year, like the ?Viva Beethoven! series, March 19 to 23, when the highly regarded Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel will conduct. In Montreal, traditional opera takes on a contemporary edge with ?Another Brick in the Wall,? on select dates from March 11 to 24 the production honors the city?s 375th anniversary and is based on Pink Floyd?s 1979 album ?The Wall. The band?s chief songwriter, Roger Waters, collaborated with Op?ra de Montr?al on the work, which is inspired by his life. There are stories of isolation and the destruction of love, and it promises to be   and emotional, just the way a captivating opera should be."
17938,Dale Russakoff,29/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"When Indira Islas was in third grade at Centennial Arts Academy, a public elementary school in Gainesville, Ga. she decided it was time to get serious. It was 2006, and she was in the lowest reading group in her class. She had been in that group since arriving two years earlier, speaking no English, in Gainesville, a city of 38, 000 just northeast of Atlanta?s booming outer suburbs. But being at the bottom went against everything she believed about herself. ?I wanted to be with the smart kids,? she recalls. Starting the year before, in second grade, she read every volume of the ?Magic Tree House? books in her   library, a series about two ordinary siblings who climb into their backyard treehouse and   to Pompeii, the Wild West, the ice age, feudal Japan and beyond. ?I absolutely loved them,? she says. ?It was like going on adventures all over the world. ? It was also the opposite of her own life. Indira left Mexico for the United States at age 6 with her parents and two younger sisters. Her mother cleaned houses when she wasn?t caring for the children  ?   there would eventually be seven of them  ?   and her father worked in construction, and there was no money for   lessons or soccer clubs, let alone traveling. ?I?d hear about trips and experiences of my white friends, and I remember thinking: I?ll never go to the beach or Disney World for spring break,? Indira says. Her parents told her that education was all that mattered, and she had to spend all her free time inside, reading and writing. ?I tell my children this country is a blessing to all the people living here,? her mother told me. ?If you have the opportunity to be good, it?s very important to take it. ? Indira took this advice to heart. By the time she was in fifth grade, her reading skills had improved so much that she tested into the top reading group. By middle school, she consistently got A?s, which qualified her for a celebratory school trip every time report cards came out. ?They rewarded us by taking us skating or bowling,? she says. ?I felt like I was so smart, just getting the chance to go out for the whole school day with friends. That?s when I said: ?I can make it. ??u2009? Indira began to throw herself into everything. At recess, she played soccer and basketball, competing so fiercely that everyone took notice. Boys usually picked other boys for their teams, and white kids tended to favor other white kids. But everyone started picking Indira. In middle school, she was on the track team, running   races. Her coach was stunned by her determination. In meets, even when she won her event, she scolded herself unless she broke her previous record. After practices ended, she would keep running. ?I wanted to think,? she says. ?I?d stay after practice and run and run and run. ? Indira remembers understanding vaguely that it wasn?t just poverty that set her and her family apart. Her parents had been doctors in Mexico. She admired pictures in their dresser drawer of the two of them in their 20s standing together, tall and proud in their white coats  ?   before they all fled the violence of drug gangs who were then taking over their home state, Guerrero. When she asked her parents why they were no longer doctors, they explained it was because they were not American citizens. It didn?t make sense to Indira. Why would her father have shed that beautiful crisp white coat for the fraying pants and shirts he now wore? Soon after Indira turned 13, in 2011, she was riding home from track practice with her mother when another car sideswiped the family?s Ford Expedition. The other driver, who was at fault, insisted on calling the police, according to Indira and a lawyer who assisted the family. Indira pleaded not to involve the police, explaining that her mother did not have a driver?s license because she was not an American citizen. (In Georgia and most other states, undocumented immigrants cannot obtain driver?s licenses.) But the driver said she needed a police report to get insurance to cover the damage to her car. A police officer arrived and asked for Indira?s mother?s license. When she said she did not have one  ?   a state crime  ?   she was told to get out of the car. Indira got out, too. She remembers two of her younger siblings sleeping in the back, one in a booster seat, one in a car seat. Two elders from the church they attended arrived to ask for mercy. She has seven children, they told the officer. He responded that he was simply enforcing the law. Indira?s mother turned to her and began to cry. ?Indira, I don?t know what is going to happen,? she said. ?They?re going to take me. ? Indira remembers remaining strangely calm. ?When she was being handcuffed, I said: ?Mom, everything is going to be O. K.??u2009? Indira?s mother was held in Gainesville?s Hall County jail for three days, but that wasn?t the most frightening part for the family. Hall is one of four counties in Georgia that have a formal agreement to report arrests of undocumented immigrants to the Department of Homeland Security, which means that infractions as minor as a   bulb above a license plate can spiral into deportation proceedings. Indira?s mother says that her charge of driving without a license ultimately led to a referral to immigration court and a deportation order instructing her to leave the country within 30 days. She stayed, slipping into the shadows. Every day since, Indira says, she and her siblings have feared that their mother would be deported. It would take only one more traffic stop. ?That woke me up,? Indira says. ?Until then, I thought the world was happy. ? In fact, she now realized, it was only American citizens who seemed truly happy. ?It must feel pretty good, I guess, to not have to worry about whether your family could be taken away any day. ? Indira has wanted to be a doctor for almost as long as she can remember. When she was 10, her family was shopping for groceries at Sam?s Club, and she spotted a large book about human anatomy. She became so excited about it that her parents bought it for her birthday, even though it was well above her reading level  ?   and their price range. She began working her way through it, mesmerized, and when she got stuck, her mother would explain whatever had stumped her. She was determined to go to college and medical school and fulfill her parents? interrupted dream. In her junior year, Indira began researching college options. She would be a strong applicant. She was consistently at or near the top of her class she was on the   track and soccer teams she volunteered over 1, 000 hours a year at the local hospital, a record in the history of the   program and she led her school?s chapter of the Hispanic Organization Promoting Education (HOPE) which encouraged Latino students  ?   who made up just over half the district?s population  ?   to stay in school and graduate. She was distressed to discover that Georgia barred undocumented immigrants from attending its top public universities and charged them    tuition at all others  ?   triple the rate for citizen residents. She then turned to researching financial aid and learned that Congress barred her from accessing federal Pell grants, loans, scholarships and   jobs  ?   the most common forms of assistance for   students. At first, she greeted this as just another set of obstacles to surmount, but as time went on, she began to despair. She would retreat to the classroom of her science teacher, Teresa Leach, who had become her mentor, in need of encouragement. ?There were a couple of times when I just cried to her because I was tired,? she said. ?I questioned myself if it was all worth the effort. ? All the while, Indira told me, she held onto her religious conviction that God had a plan, and that she must respect it. At a college fair attended by representatives of numerous Georgia colleges, she asked admissions officers what kind of help was available for undocumented students. No one had any to offer her. She switched her focus to private colleges and was admitted to Atlanta?s Agnes Scott, which she says awarded her $20, 000 annually in financial aid, less than half of what she needed. She researched   private scholarships and found two for undocumented students, but she was selected for neither. She was awarded seven small scholarships, which totaled $10, 000, enough to go to a nearby public commuter college for only one semester at the    tuition rate. Last May, Indira attended her graduation ceremony at Gainesville High School, but she had nowhere to go next. In every picture from that day, she wears a wide smile, but she was in pain inside, particularly when she caught a glimpse of her mother in the crowd, looking distraught. Unable to bring herself to celebrate with friends, she went home to be with her family. Days later, a friend told her about a philanthropic organization called TheDream. US, which was offering undocumented students full   scholarships to Delaware State University or Eastern Connecticut State University. The application was demanding, and only 76 students would be chosen. She poured herself into the essays, spending hours composing them alongside an English teacher, Cindy Lloyd. She applied to Delaware State, a historically black college in Dover, five hours closer to home than Eastern Connecticut. In late June, she received an email from TheDream. US. ?I saw ?Congratulations,??u2009? she remembers, ?and I read no more. ? In late August, Indira made the   drive with her parents from Gainesville to Delaware State in unusual silence. She was thinking hard about each of her six younger siblings, wondering how they would fare without her. Over breakfast at a Cracker Barrel in South Carolina, when her mother pressed her about how she was feeling, she talked only of her concerns about not being at home to help everyone. When she arrived on campus  ?   a flat expanse of grassy courtyards and buildings amid strip malls, auto dealers and chain restaurants just beyond Dover?s historic capital area  ?   she found 33 other ?opportunity scholars,? just as worried and hopeful as she was. All of them were assigned to a dorm about a quarter of a mile from the D. S. U. campus, a former Sheraton hotel acquired a few years earlier by the university as part of an expansion. They bonded instantly, traveling as a posse from classes to the library to the cafeteria, often ending up together late at night in the dorm lobby or in a lounge that had been a large hotel suite on the second floor. In their first month on campus, the opportunity scholars were invited to a welcoming ceremony in the school?s Martin Luther King Jr. Student Center with Gov. Jack Markell the Democratic senator Tom Carper Donald Graham, a founder of TheDream. US and D. S. U. ?s president, Harry Williams. ?This is not just an opportunity for you it is an opportunity for the state of Delaware,? Markell told them. ?It is sad to see your own home state reject such talent and potential. ? He pronounced himself ?thrilled that you?re here. ? It was the first time many of the students could recall being welcomed anywhere. ?We felt rejection our whole lives from our own states,? Indira said. ?We were here only three weeks, and we already met the governor and the senator. It felt like saying ?Haha!? to Georgia. ? Of the 34 opportunity scholars enrolled at D. S. U. 28 are from Mexico and one each is from Ecuador, El Salvador, Peru, Gabon, Gambia and Trinidad and Tobago. Their families are a composite portrait of the economic forces that have drawn undocumented immigrants to the nation?s small towns and metropolitan heartland. Their parents work in poultry plants, on factory lines, in warehouses, on construction sites, in restaurants they clean and paint houses and schools, tend gardens. ?They make everything look perfect for the tourists,? Yulma Lopez, who left Mexico at age 3, said of her parents? work for a landscaping company in Charleston, S. C. Almost all their parents work illegally, but many pay income taxes, having obtained federal   numbers. And some, including Indira?s father, have secured temporary federal permission to work and drive lawfully. While most of the students are 18 or 19, typical for college freshmen, some have worked for years in hopes of one day saving enough for college. Olivia Bekale, who is 27 and grew up in Baton Rouge, arrived in Louisiana from Gabon as a child. She graduated from high school in 2008 with a 3. 9 G. P. A. from the Louisiana School for Math, Science and the Arts, a prestigious   boarding school for top achievers. Unable to afford college, she cycled from one   position to the next  ?   server at the Melting Pot, a fondue restaurant retail sales consultant for Sprint   agent for Marriott pharmacy tech for Walgreens. Olivia, who had wanted to be a doctor since an aunt died of AIDS when she was 5, had been out of high school for eight years when she learned of the opportunity scholarship she applied immediately. All but one of the students were enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as DACA. Created in 2012 by an   executive action, DACA allowed teenagers and young adults who came to the United States illegally as children with their parents to register with the government and in turn receive a   renewable protection against deportation, along with work permits and Social Security numbers. Most of the students, like Indira, signed up at age 15, as soon as they were eligible. With DACA, Indira, who is now 18, was able to get a driver?s license and a job at a Publix supermarket when she was in high school, working 20 hours a week as a cashier and bagger. Being able to work and drive legally, free of the fears her mother faced, and fitting in with her classmates, Indira says, was ?living the American dream. ? With her income from Publix, she even was able to get braces for her teeth. The starting point for all of their dreams was education, and the quest for it has been central to the experience of undocumented young people since long before Indira and her classmates were born. In the late 1970s, when undocumented immigrants had yet to move in large numbers beyond border states, Texas passed a law authorizing local school districts to ban them from public schools or charge them tuition. In a landmark decision in Plyler v. Doe in 1982, a narrowly divided Supreme Court struck down the law, finding that undocumented children had a constitutional right to free    public education. The opinion blamed a dysfunctional immigration system for creating the crisis by failing to keep out undocumented immigrants or provide them a path to citizenship. ?Already disadvantaged as a result of poverty, lack of   ability and undeniable racial prejudices, these children, without an education, will become permanently locked into the lowest socioeconomic class,? Justice William Brennan wrote for the majority, quoting the   opinion. The case also introduced the argument that undocumented children were legally blameless, unlike their parents: ?The classification at issue deprives a group of children of the opportunity for education afforded all other children simply because they have been assigned a legal status due to a violation of law by their parents,? Justice Lewis Powell wrote in a concurring opinion. Undocumented children poured into the nation?s schools over the next generation, and as they reached college age, they coalesced into a movement, advocating access to higher education as well as full citizenship. In 2001, they began calling themselves Dreamers, now an estimated 2. 1 million young immigrants who have grown up as Americans in almost every way except for their passports. The name came from the Dream Act (Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors) introduced in Congress in 2001 by Senator Richard Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, and Senator Orrin Hatch, a Republican from Utah, and for which activists fought for over a decade. The measure, which would have put undocumented children on a path to citizenship, never passed, but the vast network of Dreamers became a compelling political force. In 2001, hundreds of them turned out to testify in Texas in favor of legislation to allow undocumented residents to pay   college tuition if they graduated from Texas high schools and lived in the state for three years. ?Something magical happened when those kids told their stories,? says the former Texas state representative Rick Noriega, a Democrat who sponsored the bill. ?It was a humanizing of a very real issue dealing with children?s dreams and hopes. Every heart on that committee was touched, Republicans and Democrats. ? The legislation passed both houses almost unanimously and was signed by Rick Perry, then governor of Texas and now President Donald Trump?s pick for energy secretary. Texas became the first state, followed quickly by California, to allow Dreamers to pay   tuition. Today, 21 states charge Dreamers the same tuition as legal residents, including six carried by Trump  ?   Florida, Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Utah and Texas. In many of those states, however, the   issue has turned politically treacherous. In Texas, efforts to repeal the tuition law come closer to passing every year, and Noriega says there is no chance the original measure would pass today. The leading national opponents of   tuition for Dreamers include the Republican senator Jeff Sessions, Trump?s choice for attorney general, and the secretary of state of Kansas, Kris Kobach, a Republican who was a leader of Trump?s transition team on immigration. Each argues that students who are in the United States illegally should not get a public benefit in any state that is denied to a citizen from another state. In other words, if Dreamers pay   tuition in Texas, citizen students next door in Arkansas and Oklahoma  ?   or Massachusetts, for that matter  ?   should have the same right. ?How much sense does that make, to have people here illegally, and they have more benefits than those who are here legally?? Sessions asked in a Senate floor statement. Kobach used the same argument to bring   lawsuits against   tuition for Dreamers in Kansas and California. Judges found no legal basis for the claims and dismissed the cases. The larger debate over how to treat an estimated 11 million immigrants who came here illegally has been at a stalemate for decades, with advocates seeking a ?path to citizenship? for   families who have been in the country for years and opponents denouncing ?amnesty? for people who broke the law to enter the country. Amid hardening resistance in Congress to immigration reform, Dreamers brought pressure on Obama  ?   including   and hunger strikes at his 2012 campaign offices  ?   to use his executive power to create DACA. The program, announced on June 15, 2012, the 30th anniversary of the Supreme Court?s Plyler decision, proved transformative for Dreamers. They have entered college, taken    jobs, received driver?s licenses, bought cars. They now fly on planes, passing effortlessly through airport security. They still lack legal immigration status, but no longer are they exactly undocumented. ?DACAmented,? many have called themselves. Even in states where they pay   tuition, Dreamers still struggle to afford college because they are disproportionately   and have no access to federal financial aid. Fewer than 10 percent of Dreamers who graduate from high school enroll in college. At a time when college graduates earn 70 percent more than those without degrees, these numbers conjure the 1982 warning by the Supreme Court that undocumented children could become a permanent underclass. In response, a handful of philanthropies have adopted the cause of sending students with DACA status to college. The biggest of these, TheDream. US, has raised $90 million to eventually finance 4, 000 students at public colleges, with significant contributions from Donald Graham, former publisher and chief executive of The Washington Post, and his family Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan Bill and Melinda Gates the   executive William Ackman and Michael Bloomberg, among others. (I was a reporter at The Washington Post from 1980 to 2008.) In 2014, TheDream. US began offering Dreamers full scholarships in states that charge them   tuition. Last year, in partnership with Delaware and Connecticut, the organization created the   program for students from the other 29 states, financed by $41 million in philanthropy from Graham and his family and two anonymous donors. The governors of Delaware and Connecticut agreed to charge roughly   tuition rates for the 34 scholars at Delaware State and the 42 at Eastern Connecticut State  ?   a total of $80, 000 per student for tuition, room and board for four years. In an effort to   political opposition, Graham says, the philanthropy works only with schools, like Delaware State and Eastern Connecticut State, that have excess capacity, so that undocumented students are not displacing citizens. And private donors pay all expenses, so that no state dollars are spent. Still, when The Delaware State News ran an article in September about the D. S. U. opportunity scholars, the online comments complained that undocumented immigrants, not citizens, were benefiting. ?Trump isn?t perfect, but I will vote for him because he puts Americans FIRST,? wrote a reader named John Huff of Magnolia, Del. ?There are plenty of kids who are citizens who have the same dream and should come first. ? And as news of the scholarship spread on the Delaware campus this fall, a number of   students told Dreamers that they resented that their own families had to go into debt for a portion of their education costs while the DACA students got full scholarships. By then, Trump had mobilized   anger in large swaths of the country, having kicked off his campaign criticizing Mexican immigrants  ?   ?They?re bringing drugs. They?re bringing crime. They?re rapists?  ?   and vowing to build a wall on the border to keep them out. In stump speeches, he promised to deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants and, in his first 100 days in office, to terminate DACA, labeling it ?illegal amnesty. ? Both vows became instant applause lines. Indira declared her major in biological sciences at the beginning of the semester and started a demanding   curriculum with six classes, including biology and chemistry, both requiring labs. Her parents had insisted she not take a job, in order to devote herself to education, freeing up four hours a night that she had spent working in high school. With that extra time, she found the academic challenges manageable. Much harder was living apart from her   family for the first time in her life. Her mother texted her daily. ?Good morning, hija,? she wrote one recent morning, using the Spanish word for daughter. ?May God bless you today in school. Please be kind to everyone. ? That night, over FaceTime, Indira talked with two of her younger sisters, who like her were born in Mexico and are undocumented. One, a junior in high school, is already on a quest for college scholarships. She and Indira came up with potential essay ideas and discussed her r?sum?. Then Indira helped the other, a freshman who is the smartest of all the family?s children, Indira says, with physics homework. On weekends, she FaceTimes with her four youngest siblings  ?   a sixth grader, a fourth grader, a third grader and a first grader  ?   all of whom were born in Georgia and are citizens. Separation from family, from home, even from Mexican food made most of the opportunity scholars profoundly lonely. Estephany Martinez, a petite   major with long black hair, couldn?t stop thinking about her sisters in the first weeks. ?Whenever we came home from school, all four sisters would sit in the living room and do our homework and talk and watch TV,? she recalled wistfully of her life in Winder, Ga. In Delaware, ?I didn?t have anybody that cared for me. I didn?t have anyone to come home to. ? In early September, she summoned all the scholars to a gathering in the dorm?s   lounge. ?All right, you guys, we?re going to be here for each other,? she said. ?That part of our lives  ?   being undocumented  ?   is critical to who we are. We have to share our stories. ? Everyone crowded in, sitting on the sofa, spilling onto the floor, sitting shoulder to shoulder on counters that once were part of a kitchenette, sprawling into one another?s space. Carlos Gonzales of Manteo, N. C. a lanky and cheerful marketing major whose mother is a restaurant cook, broke down crying when he recalled the violence that drove his family from Mexico City. He, his mother and his younger sister moved to North Carolina when he was 7. It was his mother who encouraged him, beginning in elementary school, to reach for college. ?I don?t want you to live the life we?re living now,? she told him. In high school, he was an honor student and varsity wrestler and runner, working nights and weekends at McDonald?s in his Outer Banks town. When he received the email telling him he was an opportunity scholar, he said: ?I hugged my mom and cried for two hours. The only reason I stopped was I had to go to work. ? Indira told the harrowing story that led to her own family?s departure from Mexico. In 2004, when she was 6, three masked gunmen broke into their home, which housed her parents? clinic, and robbed them of everything  ?   money, jewelry, a new computer, a television, cameras and medications. They filed a report with the police, they said, who didn?t investigate, in deference to cartels then taking over Guerrero, now the most violent state in Mexico. An uncle of her father?s already had been killed. In subsequent years, a cousin of her mother?s, a veterinarian, was kidnapped and never found. Two nephews disappeared. Her mother?s sister has been kidnapped twice  ?   most recently this past November  ?   and returned only after her family paid steep ransoms. Weeks after the robbery, Indira?s family of five arrived in the United States on a tourist visa that her father procured a month earlier in hopes of taking everyone to Disney World. Instead, they went to Gainesville, where her father?s brother worked in construction  ?   one of thousands of Mexican workers who flocked to the north Georgia community in the last 25 years, swelling the Hispanic population to more than 40 percent in 2013 from 8 percent in 1990. Indira said her parents are certain they would have been killed had they stayed. They decided to forfeit their careers for their family?s safety. ?I no longer saw my future, but I saw my children?s future,? her father said to me. Antonio Patino, a   major who is a lifeguard and plays bass and guitar in his spare time, told the group about riding with his family in their car in 2015 in Lawrenceville, Ga. when a police officer pulled them over, though none of them understood why. His father, who is undocumented and processes returns for a local manufacturer, was driving but did not have a license. Antonio and his mother, younger sister and brother all watched in terror as his father was handcuffed, placed in a police cruiser and driven off to jail. As it turned out, he was released the next day after paying a fine of more than $800 and was not referred to immigration court for further proceedings, but the incident shook Antonio?s sense of belonging in America. ?I felt like I got slapped in the face just for living, trying to be a normal person in this beautiful country,? he said. ?It feels like a hole inside me. ? He said he now found himself gripped with fears for his parents? safety at random moments during his days at D. S. U. It is as if he has swapped roles with his mother and father. ?Like I?m now the parent and they?re the child, and I?m worried for them,? he told me. ?Not being there, all these   swarm into my mind. What if out of nowhere they get pulled over again?? Calling them and hearing their voices usually comforts him. But after one such call, he said: ?I went outside, and I had to cry a little. I was feeling like I couldn?t help them. ? A number of students shared the enormous sacrifices they had seen their parents make for them. Juan Chavez, 23, who grew up in Plymouth, Ind. and worked for five years after high school, told of his mother suffering a breakdown after her divorce from his father. He saw it as a response to the crushing instability of their lives, moving from one home to another in search of shelter. ?She?s the strongest person I?ll ever know,? he said. ?She?s my role model. My father figure as well as my mother. ? He continued: ?I felt so helpless to make things better. I decided almost right then I?ll go to college and medical school if it takes me the rest of my life. ? He is now a psychology and   major, intending to become a psychiatrist. On and on the students went until almost 3 a. m. the common threads in their stories drawing them closer. It was the first time most of them had talked openly about being undocumented, but instead of feeling exposed, they felt safer. Until then, Antonio had gone out of his way to avoid conversations with   at D. S. U. about his scholarship, not wanting to have to explain that he got it because he was undocumented. The next day, though, he fell into conversation with a student who asked him how he happened to come all the way from Georgia to D. S. U. and he said without hesitation: ?I got a scholarship. ? ?What for?? ?I?m undocumented,? Antonio said, surprised at how comfortable this felt. ?O. K. man, that?s cool,? the student said. After their long night talking, the scholars also better understood what had propelled them all for as long as they could remember. Throughout high school, the opportunity scholars watched undocumented friends and siblings give up and drop out, shamed and beaten down by public scorn over illegal immigration and the   options awaiting even those who excelled in high school. But they kept on striving, steeled to the insults, positioning themselves for a breakthrough they couldn?t yet see. Now this all made sense. ?This pain  ?   it pushes us,? Estephany said. ?It?s motivation. It has made me who I am. It makes me go through every day. ? ?Now we know what drives us,? Indira said. One morning in   at 9:50 a. m. 10 minutes before Indira?s   class was scheduled to start, she and two other opportunity scholars were already ensconced in the three center   seats, notebooks, pens and textbooks at the ready. Indira was wearing a Harvard sweatshirt that a classmate bought for her when their   A. P.  class visited Boston. (Indira couldn?t afford to go.) ?I?m going to get there one day,? she said with a confident smile. Most of the other students didn?t arrive until class was about to begin  ?   or later  ?   and there was little competition for the front rows. A similar scene unfolded that morning in the ultramodern science center, in   class, where Antonio and Jose Reyes Rios, another   major, sat front and center with an   classmate named Hanqaamo Lintisio, who is from Maryland and has a track scholarship. The three had formed a study group and tutored one another so effectively that they all scored above 100 on the midterm. (They nailed the bonus question.) Theirs were the only A?s in the class. The Dreamers gather daily at a long Formica table in a D. S. U. cafeteria for food and conversation. At lunch, Carla Moreno propped her English composition textbook, ?Patterns for College Writing,? against a napkin holder, securing it with an apple. She paged through a chapter while eating her salad and chili dog. ?It?s just a quiz,? she said, ?but I want to keep my A. ? ?I deal with a lot of students, and I feel like the Dreamers are at a different level,? says Kevin Noriega, the adviser for their scholarships. ?They?re saying, ?I?ve got to make this happen because it?s my only option. ??u2009? Of the 488 scholars funded by TheDream. US who began college in 2014, 94 percent remain enrolled after their sophomore year research shows that only 66 percent of   college students nationally return after one year. ?This is a   population with retention rates like Harvard?s,? Donald Graham says. Because beneficiaries of TheDream. US have full rides, they avoid a common problem faced by other disadvantaged students: running short of money for costs not covered by Pell grants or other forms of aid. One night in October before a biology exam, Indira went to the D. S. U. athletic center for a workout to relieve stress. She was armed with a stack of homemade flash cards and her iPhone, on which she had downloaded discussions of test topics from various websites. While pounding ou"

17446,Alain de Botton,9/01/2017,2017,1,lifestyle,"IT?S one of the things we are most afraid might happen to us. We go to great lengths to avoid it. And yet we do it all the same: We marry the wrong person. Partly, it?s because we have a bewildering array of problems that emerge when we try to get close to others. We seem normal only to those who don?t know us very well. In a wiser, more   society than our own, a standard question on any early dinner date would be: ?And how are you crazy?? Perhaps we have a latent tendency to get furious when someone disagrees with us or can relax only when we are working perhaps we?re tricky about intimacy after sex or clam up in response to humiliation. Nobody?s perfect. The problem is that before marriage, we rarely delve into our complexities. Whenever casual relationships threaten to reveal our flaws, we blame our partners and call it a day. As for our friends, they don?t care enough to do the hard work of enlightening us. One of the privileges of being on our own is therefore the sincere impression that we are really quite easy to live with. Our partners are no more  . Naturally, we make a stab at trying to understand them. We visit their families. We look at their photos, we meet their college friends. All this contributes to a sense that we?ve done our homework. We haven?t. Marriage ends up as a hopeful, generous, infinitely kind gamble taken by two people who don?t know yet who they are or who the other might be, binding themselves to a future they cannot conceive of and have carefully avoided investigating. For most of recorded history, people married for logical sorts of reasons: because her parcel of land adjoined yours, his family had a flourishing business, her father was the magistrate in town, there was a castle to keep up, or both sets of parents subscribed to the same interpretation of a holy text. And from such reasonable marriages, there flowed loneliness, infidelity, abuse, hardness of heart and screams heard through the nursery doors. The marriage of reason was not, in hindsight, reasonable at all it was often expedient,   snobbish and exploitative. That is why what has replaced it  ?   the marriage of feeling  ?   has largely been spared the need to account for itself. What matters in the marriage of feeling is that two people are drawn to each other by an overwhelming instinct and know in their hearts that it is right. Indeed, the more imprudent a marriage appears (perhaps it?s been only six months since they met one of them has no job or both are barely out of their teens) the safer it can feel. Recklessness is taken as a counterweight to all the errors of reason, that catalyst of misery, that accountant?s demand. The prestige of instinct is the traumatized reaction against too many centuries of unreasonable reason. But though we believe ourselves to be seeking happiness in marriage, it isn?t that simple. What we really seek is familiarity  ?   which may well complicate any plans we might have had for happiness. We are looking to recreate, within our adult relationships, the feelings we knew so well in childhood. The love most of us will have tasted early on was often confused with other, more destructive dynamics: feelings of wanting to help an adult who was out of control, of being deprived of a parent?s warmth or scared of his anger, of not feeling secure enough to communicate our wishes. How logical, then, that we should as   find ourselves rejecting certain candidates for marriage not because they are wrong but because they are too right  ?   too balanced, mature, understanding and reliable  ?   given that in our hearts, such rightness feels foreign. We marry the wrong people because we don?t associate being loved with feeling happy. We make mistakes, too, because we are so lonely. No one can be in an optimal frame of mind to choose a partner when remaining single feels unbearable. We have to be wholly at peace with the prospect of many years of solitude in order to be appropriately picky otherwise, we risk loving no longer being single rather more than we love the partner who spared us that fate. Finally, we marry to make a nice feeling permanent. We imagine that marriage will help us to bottle the joy we felt when the thought of proposing first came to us: Perhaps we were in Venice, on the lagoon, in a motorboat, with the evening sun throwing glitter across the sea, chatting about aspects of our souls no one ever seemed to have grasped before, with the prospect of dinner in a risotto place a little later. We married to make such sensations permanent but failed to see that there was no solid connection between these feelings and the institution of marriage. Indeed, marriage tends decisively to move us onto another, very different and more administrative plane, which perhaps unfolds in a suburban house, with a long commute and maddening children who kill the passion from which they emerged. The only ingredient in common is the partner. And that might have been the wrong ingredient to bottle. The good news is that it doesn?t matter if we find we have married the wrong person. We mustn?t abandon him or her, only the founding Romantic idea upon which the Western understanding of marriage has been based the last 250 years: that a perfect being exists who can meet all our needs and satisfy our every yearning. We need to swap the Romantic view for a tragic (and at points comedic) awareness that every human will frustrate, anger, annoy, madden and disappoint us  ?   and we will (without any malice) do the same to them. There can be no end to our sense of emptiness and incompleteness. But none of this is unusual or grounds for divorce. Choosing whom to commit ourselves to is merely a case of identifying which particular variety of suffering we would most like to sacrifice ourselves for. This philosophy of pessimism offers a solution to a lot of distress and agitation around marriage. It might sound odd, but pessimism relieves the excessive imaginative pressure that our romantic culture places upon marriage. The failure of one particular partner to save us from our grief and melancholy is not an argument against that person and no sign that a union deserves to fail or be upgraded. The person who is best suited to us is not the person who shares our every taste (he or she doesn?t exist) but the person who can negotiate differences in taste intelligently  ?   the person who is good at disagreement. Rather than some notional idea of perfect complementarity, it is the capacity to tolerate differences with generosity that is the true marker of the ?not overly wrong? person. Compatibility is an achievement of love it must not be its precondition. Romanticism has been unhelpful to us it is a harsh philosophy. It has made a lot of what we go through in marriage seem exceptional and appalling. We end up lonely and convinced that our union, with its imperfections, is not ?normal. ? We should learn to accommodate ourselves to ?wrongness,? striving always to adopt a more forgiving, humorous and kindly perspective on its multiple examples in ourselves and in our partners."
17782,Erin McCann,20/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"When Donald J. Trump takes the oath of office on Friday, he will do so with his hand on two Bibles: his own, and one used by Abraham Lincoln in 1861. Only one other president has used that Bible for the oath: Mr. Trump?s predecessor. Thomas Barrack Jr. the chairman of Mr. Trump?s inaugural committee, said in a statement earlier this week that the   ?is humbled to place his hand on Bibles that hold special meaning both to his family and to our country. ? Mr. Trump?s personal Bible was given to him by his mother in 1955, two days before his ninth birthday, according to a statement from the inaugural committee. He had just completed the Sunday Church Primary School at the First Presbyterian Church in Queens, where he grew up. To use the Lincoln Bible, the inaugural committee has to borrow it from its permanent home at the Library of Congress. Lincoln swore the oath on it at his first inaugural in 1861, as the United States stood on the cusp of the Civil War. It was not used again at an inauguration until the election of Barack Obama, who was sworn in on it in 2009 and again in 2013. Conservationists at the Library of Congress said the book was ready for another big day, though they have wary eyes turned toward a weather forecast that hints at the possibility of rain. ?We always have it in the back of our mind that this might be happening,? said Elmer Eusman, who is the head of conservation. ?So we?re prepared. ? ?We already had made a protective box for it for Obama?s inauguration,? he said, adding that the library is creating a Mylar wraparound for the cover to protect it from rain. Mr. Eusman said the library would also have someone on standby who will be notified immediately if the Bible has been damaged and will whisk it back to a conservation lab for immediate repair. The steps are mostly precautionary. The Lincoln Bible is in good shape, and ?it can certainly sustain this kind of activity,? said Mark Dimunation, the head of rare books and special collections. The Bible was given to the library by Mary Lincoln, the widow of Robert Todd Lincoln, the president?s son, Mr. Dimunation said. The collection also included the contents of President Lincoln?s pocket from the night he was killed. ?We?ve used it from time to time in exhibitions, and when we talk about Lincoln, it gives us the opportunity to bring out the Bible and talk about the content of the first inaugural address,? Mr. Dimunation said. ?It does have a certain kind of electricity about it because of the nature of that inaugural event. ? Because his election had been so divisive  ?   between the election and the inauguration, seven states had seceded from the Union  ?   there was real concern that Lincoln would be attacked and so he was smuggled into Washington. His household effects, including his family Bible, were still being shipped from Springfield, Ill. Mr. Dimunation said. A clerk for the Supreme Court, William Thomas Carroll, was sent out to buy what became the Lincoln Bible. The book is an 1853 Oxford University Press printing of the King James Bible, Mr. Eusman said, and it is bound in burgundy velvet with metal trim. It is approximately six by four inches and about an inch and a quarter thick. ?It?s not very big,? he said. The back holds a large blue paper seal on yellow paper, where Mr. Carroll recorded the events of the day. ?It has an accretion of ceremonial use that really gives this object an emotional and historical weight at this point,? Mr. Dimunation said. While the Constitution requires presidents to take an oath of office, there is no rule requiring them to do so with their hands on a religious book, or any book at all. Most have used a family Bible. The Bible used by George Washington at the first inauguration has been popular with his successors. Warren G. Harding, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Jimmy Carter and George H. W. Bush all used it, and in 2001, George W. Bush had made preparations to be the sixth president to do so. Members of the New York Masonic temple that cares for the bible carried it to the Capitol, but rain intervened. Mr. Bush used his father?s family Bible instead. In 1825, John Quincy Adams was sworn in on a law book, according to the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies. Adams was also, according to the committee, the first president to wear long trousers at his inauguration, breaking with the five presidents before him, who all had worn knee breeches. Lyndon B. Johnson, a Protestant, was sworn in aboard Air Force One using a Roman Catholic missal, after the assassination of John F. Kennedy. The prayer book had been found at Kennedy?s bedside table on the plane. And in 1901, Theodore Roosevelt was hiking in the Adirondack Mountains when he received word that William McKinley was not likely to survive being shot in Buffalo. By the time Roosevelt got there, McKinley had died. ?When he arrived there was a fair amount of confusion,? said Mark Lozo, the director of education and interpretation at the Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural Site in Buffalo. ?They were still making arrangements for administering the oath of office. ? No Bible could be found for the   ceremony at the home of Roosevelt?s friend Ansley Wilcox, now the site of the museum. ?With the ceremony already underway, they decided to proceed without one,? Mr. Lozo said."
17495,Ben Brantley,27/03/2017,2017,3,entertainment,"As is so often the case, the party doesn?t really get going until everybody is good and drunk. Then, after much wine, vodka and awkward conversation, comes a fabulous eruption of runaway hedonism. Maybe, you think, coming to this shindig wasn?t such a bad idea, after all. You?ve known such moments, surely, when the spectacle of people going stark raving wild carries its own irresistible, anarchic logic. A feeling of vital connection saturates the room like the fizz from an exploded bottle of Champagne. Alas, the thrill is   a lonely cascade of fireworks in a night of damp squibs. And the briefly, beautifully animated revelers go back to being their soggy, miserable selves. That?s what happens  ?   in terms of both plot and performance  ?   toward the end of the first half of ?The Present,? the Sydney Theater Company?s sprawling and confused adaptation of a sprawling and confused play written by a young Anton Chekhov. This fitful Australian import, which opened on Sunday night at the Barrymore Theater, chronicles the bad behavior at one   birthday celebration. The mistress of these revels, I am happy to report, is the extraordinary screen star Cate Blanchett, making a   Broadway debut. Ms. Blanchett is portraying the hostess and birthday girl, Anna, a ravishing widow who is unhappily turning 40. Ms. Blanchett knows how to hold a stage and, if necessary, hijack it. Her   performances in ?A Streetcar Named Desire? (at the Brooklyn Academy of Music) and ?Uncle Vanya? (at New York City Center) both for the Sydney Theater Company, were as brilliant as they were brave. Such commanding,   charisma is useful if you?re attempting to hold together a badly assembled party or, for that matter, play. But here Ms. Blanchett?s   inventiveness is as sorely taxed as that of her character. Anna?s party turns into the kind of disaster that ends not only in tears but also bloodshed. This production, on the other hand, feels moribund from the beginning. Frantic attempts at resuscitation by Ms. Blanchett and her valiant leading man (and unforgettable   in ?Uncle Vanya?) a tireless Richard Roxburgh as a hapless homme fatale, only occasionally succeed in eliciting a pulse. ?The Present,? which has been adapted by Andrew Upton (Ms. Blanchett?s husband) and directed by John Crowley, is the Chekhov play that almost got away. Though the scholarship on its origins is uncertain, it appears that Chekhov began writing it as an    student, and it exudes a youthful, passionate untidiness. Its manuscript, a whopper in length, wasn?t published until nearly two decades after his death. An uncut version would take at least five hours this one is three. The eminent playwrights Michael Frayn and David Hare, among others, have done their best to domesticate this shaggy behemoth. Mr. Frayn reconceived it as an elegant sex farce, under the title ?Wild Honey? (seen briefly on Broadway in the  ) while Mr. Hare?s adaptation hewed closer to the more brooding, tragicomic template usually associated with Chekhov. That version is called ?Platonov,? and I saw a fine production of it at London?s National Theater last summer. Directed by Jonathan Kent, it was set in the period in which it was written. And the vestiges of   decorum served as an appropriately chafing corset for the flabby plot. Mr. Upton drags the story out of the twilight of the czars and into the   morning after of the  . As in the original script, it?s a period of profound uneasiness, when a nation?s future is murky and its citizens unsure of their roles. But despite the inclusion of several   soliloquies on recent Russian history, it?s hard to comprehend what they?re reacting against here. Exit the robber barons (and the real aristocrats) enter the   oligarchs and their murderous henchmen. Farewell, balalaikas hello, the Clash. As for those without a fixed part in the new scheme of things, they?re the same old kvetchers of yore, doomed to circular philosophizing and   drinking. Chief among these is Mikhail Platonov (Mr. Roxburgh) a provincial schoolteacher of vaulting wit and unfulfilled aspirations. He knew Anna when she was the young trophy wife of a powerful general, now dead. It?s at the general?s summer dacha  ?   rendered with all the personality of an Ikea showroom by the show?s designer, Alice Babidge  ?   that Anna has chosen to celebrate her birthday. Her guests include her stepson, Sergei (Chris Ryan) who as a youth was best friends with Nikolai (Toby Schmitz) and Mikhail, who is married to Nikolai?s sister, Sasha (Susan Prior). Though Mikhail is a bloviator, a womanizer and a mean drunk, Sasha loves her   husband. So, more problematically, do all the other women in the play, who, in addition to the patrician Anna, include Sergei?s wife, Sophia (Jacqueline McKenzie) a humanitarian physician, and Nikolai?s girlfriend, Maria (Anna Bamford). It?s hard to fathom the attraction, but apparently once you?ve had your first whiff of him, Mikhail is as addictive and dangerous as crack cocaine. Maybe it?s because he?s livelier and more subversive than the other guys, who include Anna?s rich older suitors, Alexei (Martin Jacobs) and Yegor (David Downer). But like most of his contemporaries, Mikhail can?t stop talking about how directionless his life is. Such flailing is common in Chekhov. But usually you understand the specific, idiosyncratic places his characters are coming from. In this version, everyone seems to be flailing interchangeably, in the same stale vacuum, for all eternity. (Setting the play?s third section in what looks like a   dreamscape only compounds the impression.) Ms. Blanchett does bring colorful shades of excitement to being bored. Her Anna plays a great game of dramatically uninterested chess, and her response to a rambling speech by Mikhail at the lunch table is priceless. (Hint: it involves the removal of an undergarment.) That comes just before that     bacchanal I wrote about earlier. It?s one of the most memorable party sequences I?ve ever seen, a volcanic channeling of a displaced class?s fear, anger and disgust. These people want to blow up their world, and in a way they do, most entertainingly. That leaves us with another full hour of tediously sorting through the ashes."
18209,Hiroko Tabuchi,3/02/2017,2017,2,politics,"Republicans on Thursday took one of their first steps to officially dismantle   environmental regulations by easing restrictions on coal mining, bolstering an industry that President Trump has made a symbol of America?s neglected heartland. Using an obscure law that allows Congress to review regulations before they take effect, the Senate voted to reverse the Stream Protection Rule, which seeks to protect the nation?s waterways from debris generated by a practice called surface mining. The Interior Department had said the rule would protect 6, 000 miles of streams and 52, 000 acres of forests by keeping coal mining debris away from nearby waters. The Senate vote was 54 to 45, following a House vote for repeal on Wednesday. ?Make no mistake about it, this Obama administration rule is not designed to protect streams,? Representative Bill Johnson, a Republican from Ohio who sponsored the move to reverse the rule, said on Wednesday. ?Instead, it was an effort to regulate the coal mining industry right out of business. ? The Senate also moved to reverse a separate rule requiring publicly traded oil, gas and mineral companies to disclose payments to foreign governments for licenses or permits. The disclosure rule was aimed at curbing bribery and at helping   developing countries hold   companies, and their governments, accountable. After a procedural vote on Thursday, final Senate action to cancel the rule is expected Friday, with Mr. Trump?s signature to follow. The Trump administration, which has vowed to peel back regulations, is particularly close to the fossil fuel industry. On Wednesday, the Senate confirmed President Trump?s pick for secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, the former chairman and chief executive of Exxon Mobil. Exxon had argued that forcing American oil companies to reveal payments to foreign governments would put them at a competitive disadvantage. Full disclosure could also have made it trickier for Exxon to pursue business deals in countries like Russia, where the state plays a central role. Both the coal and   rules were made final in the last days of the Obama administration, putting them in the cross hairs of the   Congress, together with other   Obama regulations yet to take effect. The Stream Protection Rule, which requires companies to restore mined areas to their original physical and ecological state and to monitor for environmental effects, would have effectively made mountaintop removal uneconomical, experts said  ?   especially when coal prices remain depressed amid competition from natural gas and renewable energy sources like wind and solar. But the rule was challenged in court almost immediately by Republican attorneys general in states across the country, as well as the   coal giant Murray Energy. The company had previously filed 14, 000 pages of comments opposing stronger regulations. ?This unlawful and destructive rule is nothing but a thinly veiled attempt to destroy our nation?s underground coal mines and put our nation?s coal miners out of work,? Robert E. Murray, the company?s chief executive, said in comments released ahead of Thursday?s vote. A report released by the Congressional Research Service last month laid out the environmental and health benefits of the rule. Stream restoration requirements would reduce human exposure to contaminants in the drinking water, and the probability of adverse health effects, the report said. The replanting of trees also required by the rule would increase carbon storage and reduce emissions, aiding in the fight against climate change, the report said. The report also outlined the costs to industry: $52 million in annual compliance costs for the coal industry as a whole, of which roughly half was expected to be borne by mining operations in Appalachia. The rule could endanger up to 590 coal mining jobs in the region, the report estimated, though the losses would be partly offset by engineers and biologists that companies would need to hire to comply with its terms. Even without the rule, coal industry employment would shrink by more than 15, 000 workers, from a total of 90, 000 in 2012, the report noted. Still, on the campaign trail, Mr. Trump had pointed to coal mining?s decline as a symptom of overzealous environmental regulation and the neglect of   Americans by coastal elites. He vowed that, as president, he would ?put our miners back to work?  ?   a promise that resonated with voters in battleground states, including those in Appalachia. But the American market for coal is shrinking, with or without new rules and regulations. Utility companies have drastically reduced their reliance on coal. Nationally, about 300   power plants have closed since 2008, according to the National Mining Association, a trade group. Many of those plants are not coming back, whatever the policy out of Washington, making it imperative that Appalachia diversify its economy, industry analysts say. Daile Rois, 56, lives about 2, 000 feet from a shuttered coal mine outside Charleston, W. Va. The mine, Keystone Development No. 2, released debris and chemicals into two creeks that meet at the edge of her property and run past her home. After intense opposition from environmental groups, which documented streams clouded by sediment and monitored rising acidity levels, West Virginia?s Department of Environmental Protection permanently closed the mine last year and ordered the operator to restore the site  ?   a rare victory for local environmentalists. ?Here in West Virginia, many creeks run orange? from the contamination, said Ms. Rois, who moved to West Virginia in 2012 with her partner to take care of elderly relatives. She called the Republican vote to repeal the Stream Protection Rule devastating, a move that would allow mines like Keystone to stay open. ?Of course I care about miners? jobs, and I care about their safety,? Ms. Rois said. ?But orange is not the color of water. ?"
17686,Dom Phillips,16/01/2017,2017,1,crime,"RIO DE JANEIRO  ?   The death toll from a riot in a penitentiary in northeastern Brazil rose on Sunday to 26 prisoners, increasing the number of prison killings in the country this year to more than 120. Decapitations and mutilations are common in Brazil?s violent, overcrowded prisons, in which 40 percent of inmates have yet to be sentenced, but the latest wave of brutality has appalled many here. The riot began around 5 p. m. on Saturday at the State Penitentiary of Alca?uz, 13 miles from Natal, in the state of Rio Grande do Norte, and continued until around 7 a. m. on Sunday, when riot police officers took control of the prison. ?The situation of the rebellion is controlled,? said Maj. Eduardo Franco of the Rio Grande do Norte police. On Sunday, the authorities initially said they had found 27 bodies, but the death toll was later revised to 26 Major Franco said there had been a mistake. Many of the bodies were mutilated. The prison has a capacity of 620 but was holding around 1, 100 prisoners when the riot began, the authorities said. All of the inmates had been sentenced, Major Franco added. Wilma Batista, the director of the prison agents? union in Rio Grande do Norte, sent a photograph of two headless, mutilated corpses in a prison yard via a cellphone messaging service and said she had seen many others. ?We are shocked,? she said. With Brazil swamped in recession, President Michel Temer?s government reeling from one graft scandal after another, and a wave of seemingly uncontrollable prison violence, many Brazilians feel they are going back to a darker recent past when crime, corruption and the economy were out of control. ?We thought we had turned that page, and now it is coming back,? said Mauricio Santoro, a professor of international relations and political science at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. The killings reflected the escalation of a deadly gang war that exploded when 56 prisoners were massacred in Manaus, in Amazonas State, on Jan. 1. Four more were killed the next day in another jail in the city. The state authorities attributed the Manaus deaths to the Family of the North, an Amazon drug gang that had attacked prisoners connected to a rival gang, the S?o   First Capital Command, known by its Portuguese abbreviation, P. C. C. The gangs were believed to be fighting for control of lucrative drug smuggling routes. The P. C. C. was for years allied with a Rio de Janeiro drug gang called the Red Command. Last year, the alliance fell apart, leading to a spate of prison killings. On Jan. 6, after the Manaus massacre, 33 prisoners were found butchered at a prison in Boa Vista in Roraima State, in the far north of Brazil. The state authorities said the P. C. C. was behind the killings. Four more prisoners were killed in a third Manaus prison after being moved from the site of the first massacre. The riot on Saturday night began when prisoners linked to the P. C. C. rebelled during visiting hours, Ms. Batista said. They were in a separate prison, Rog?rio Coutinho Madruga, which is next to Alca?uz and effectively part of the same complex. She said that just six prison agents were on duty, and that they managed to free visitors before retreating to another block. ?The agents saved the visitors and had to retreat? because prisoners set the block on fire, Ms. Batista said. The escaped prisoners then attacked a block inside the Alca?uz jail that housed men from another gang, the Rio Grande do   Crime Syndicate, Ms. Batista said. Since 2015, many of the cells inside Alca?uz have had no bars, and prisoners wander freely 24 hours a day, Ms. Batista said. Police officers and prison guards managed to stop the killing from spreading further, but electricity to the prison was cut. The police decided to wait until dawn before entering, and they restrained desperate relatives who were trying to get inside. Lincoln Gakiya, a state prosecutor from an organized crime unit in S?o Paulo State who has specialized in the P. C. C. said its split with the Red Command was behind the crisis. The Rio gang has allied with five other gangs around Brazil, including the Crime Syndicate. ?This war is for the hegemony of the drug trade,? Mr. Gakiya said. ?The prison system is not prepared for this gang war. There is no place to separate the gangs. The system is overcrowded, so the tendency is to get worse. ? A cellphone video circulating on social media showed a man with his face covered, brandishing what looked like a machete or a sword, walking among a large number of mutilated bodies in what appeared to be a prison yard. The letters P. C. C. were scrawled in what looked like blood on a wall. Although it was impossible to verify the video, the bodies visible were wearing blue shorts similar to those worn by prisoners shown in local news reports. Grisly videos like this have circulated after all of the attacks. Sublieutenant Eliabe Marques, a police officer and the president of a Rio Grande do Norte state association of police and firefighter sublieutenants, said the dispute between the P. C. C. and the Crime Syndicate had grown worse recently. ?In jail, the prisoner has to join one or other of the gangs, P. C. C. or the Crime Syndicate,? he said. ?It is a phenomenon that is making the situation in Rio Grande do Norte even more serious. ? Ms. Batista said the prison agents? union had warned of potentially explosive conditions inside the prison but had been ignored. ?It is very sad, not just for the butchery, but to see organized crime face the state, the power of the state, leaving more scars on prison agents who suffer psychologically and physically from such a stressful profession,? she said."
17317,Mark Landler,17/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"WASHINGTON  ?   President Obama?s advisers wrestled with an intractable problem in the spring and summer of 2015: How could they stabilize Afghanistan while preserving Mr. Obama?s longtime goal of pulling out the last American troops before he left office? As it happened, the president solved the problem for them. In early August of that year, when Mr. Obama convened a meeting of the National Security Council, he looked around the table and acknowledged a stark new reality. ?The fever in this room has finally broken,? the president told the group, according to a person in the meeting. ?We?re no longer in   mode. ? What Mr. Obama meant was that no one in the Situation Room that day, himself included, thought that the United States  ?   after 14 years of war, billions of dollars spent and more than 2, 000 American lives lost  ?   would ever transform Afghanistan into a semblance of a democracy able to defend itself. At the same time, he added, ?the counterterrorism challenges are real. ? As bleak as Afghanistan?s prospects were, the United States could not afford to walk away and allow the country to become a seedbed for extremists again. A few weeks later, the president halted the withdrawal and announced that he would leave thousands of American troops in the country indefinitely. It was a crucial turning point in the evolution of Barack Obama. The antiwar candidate of 2008 who had pledged to turn around Afghanistan  ?   the ?good war? to George W. Bush?s ?bad war? in Iraq  ?   had conceded that the longest military operation in American history would not end on his watch. The optimistic president who once thought Afghanistan was winnable had, through bitter experience, become the commander in chief of a forever war. He remains defensive about the lessons of that journey. ?We shouldn?t assume that every time a country has problems that it reflects a failure of American policy,? the president said in an interview in September. Now, as Mr. Obama prepares to turn the war over to Donald J. Trump, a leader even more skeptical than he is about the value of American engagement in foreign conflicts, Afghanistan captures the disillusionment of a man who believed, as he put it in his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech, ?that war is sometimes necessary, and war at some level is an expression of human folly. ? More than any other conflict, Afghanistan shaped Mr. Obama?s thinking on the basic questions of war, peace and the use of military power. It is where he discovered his affinity for drones, sharpened his belief in the limits of American intervention, battled his generals and hardened his disdain for unreliable foreign leaders. It reaffirmed his suspicions about sending American troops into foreign conflicts and made him reluctant to use more force in Iraq, Syria, Libya and other war zones. It also chastened him about his own hopes. ?When it comes to helping these societies stabilize and create a more secure environment and a better life for their people, we have to understand,? he said in the interview, ?that this is a long slog. ? Mr. Obama was a state senator from Illinois in October 2002 when he famously condemned Iraq as a ?dumb war. ? But in the same speech he also said, ?I don?t oppose all wars. ? He was referring to Afghanistan, which he viewed as a just war to hunt down the perpetrators of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. ?I would willingly take up arms myself to prevent such tragedy from happening again,? he told the crowd that day in Chicago?s Federal Plaza. By July 2008, as the Democratic nominee for president, Mr. Obama had embraced Afghanistan as a priority over Iraq  ?   the ?good war,? in a phrase that he never actually used himself but that became so associated with his approach it was sometimes wrongly attributed to him. Mr. Obama praised the Bush administration?s troop surge in Iraq that year not because he believed that the United States could transform Iraqi society, but because he thought that reducing the violence there would allow the nation to turn its attention to Afghanistan. ?This is a war that we have to win,? he declared. He promised to send at least two more combat brigades, or roughly 10, 000 soldiers, to Afghanistan. The United States was hardly on course for victory. Although there were already close to 50, 000 American troops in Afghanistan as Mr. Obama campaigned that summer, the Taliban were gaining momentum. In a bloody debacle, nine American soldiers were killed in what became known as the Battle of Wanat when the Taliban brazenly overran a remote Army outpost in the far eastern province of Nuristan. Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, echoed Mr. Obama in calling the situation in the country ?precarious and urgent. ? More than 100 Americans would die in Afghanistan by the end of 2008, a larger number than in any other prior year. When Mr. Obama took office in January 2009, he ordered a quick policy review on Afghanistan by a former intelligence analyst, Bruce Riedel. But even before it was completed, he accepted a Pentagon recommendation to send 17, 000 additional troops to Afghanistan, bringing the total to nearly 70, 000 American troops on the ground. By the fall of 2009, with the Taliban showing increased strength, Mr. Obama?s military commanders, backed by the elders on his war council, including Hillary Clinton, then his secretary of state, were pressing him to go much farther. They urged on him an ambitious counterinsurgency strategy that had helped turn around the war in Iraq  ?   a     expensive doctrine of trying to win over the locals by building roads, bridges, schools and a   government. The strategy, known by its acronym COIN, would require as many as 40, 000 additional American men and women in uniform in Afghanistan, his advisers told him. ?There was still the afterglow of the surge in Iraq, and the counterinsurgency narrative that had made the military the savior of the Iraq war,? said Vali R. Nasr, a former State Department adviser on Afghanistan and Pakistan. ?I don?t believe Obama was in a position to pick a debate with the military on Afghanistan, and to assert what would be his worldview. ? ?In many ways, I think, he deferred,? said Mr. Nasr, now the dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. Although Mr. Obama agreed after months of internal debate to send 30, 000 additional troops to Afghanistan, he placed a strict timetable on the mission, saying they would have to be withdrawn again, starting in July 2011. His aides later said he felt hijacked by a military that had presented him with a narrow band of options rather than a real choice. Even some former military commanders agreed, saying that the troop deployments were framed in a way that made choosing a smaller number  ?   20, 000, for example  ?   look like a path to certain defeat. ?President Obama was asking the military for broad options,? said Karl W. Eikenberry, a retired general who served as the commander in Afghanistan from 2005 to 2007 and was later Mr. Obama?s ambassador to Kabul. But, he said, the military gave Mr. Obama only ?variations? on ?the more robust counterinsurgency model. ? Mr. Eikenberry, who wrote a politically explosive but prescient cable in late 2009 raising doubts about the wisdom of the surge, diagnosed a deeper problem with the policy. Was it simply to prevent Afghanistan from being a safe haven for Al Qaeda? Or was it to turn Afghanistan into another Denmark? ?When he came in, everyone knew we were going to do more,? Mr. Eikenberry said. ?But what we were trying to achieve was difficult to define. ? Given Mr. Obama?s innate wariness of   it didn?t take long for him to grow disenchanted with the Denmark option. A few months into the surge, in the spring of 2010, David H. Petraeus, the commander of the Pentagon?s Central Command and an architect of the strategy, was briefing him on the state of the counterinsurgency campaign. Drawing on anthropology theory from the University of Chicago, General Petraeus explained to his commander in chief how neighborhoods in Kandahar related to one another. Mr. Obama listened for a while, then cut him off. ?We can?t worry about how neighborhoods relate to each other in Kandahar,? he curtly told General Petraeus, according to people in the room. ?Obama believes the military can do enormous things,? said Benjamin J. Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser. ?It can win wars and stabilize conflicts. But a military can?t create a political culture or build a society. ? By the end of his first term, Mr. Obama had evolved to the point that he fully embraced the concept ?Afghan good enough. ? The phrase, which had been kicked around the White House since 2010, referred to the shift away from   to a policy that was content with taking out the terrorists, preventing the Taliban from overrunning the country and putting a premium on getting the troops out. By that new standard, things had improved in Afghanistan. By August 2010, 100, 000 American troops were on the ground in Afghanistan and were pushing back the Taliban in some critical areas. Despite uneven progress in the military campaign, Ryan Crocker, a diplomat who had reopened the American Embassy in Kabul in 2002 and served there again as ambassador in 2011, recalled thinking, ?Wow, this place looks great!? The Navy SEAL raid that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in May 2011 added to Mr. Obama?s conviction that he was on the way to closing the books on the war. At midnight on May 1, 2012, Air Force One rolled out from behind a hangar at Joint Base Andrews to pick up the president for a secret trip to Afghanistan. He was going to sign a strategic partnership agreement with President Hamid Karzai that set the terms for relations after 2014, when the United States was scheduled to withdraw its combat troops and turn over Afghanistan?s security to the Afghans. Aides to Mr. Obama had advised him not to go for security reasons, but he saw it as an important milestone. The agreement promised an ?enduring partnership? between the United States and Afghanistan, with pledges of American help in developing the Afghan economy and public institutions. Yet the promises obscured a starker reality: Mr. Obama had accelerated the timetable for drawing down American troops, and he was looking beyond the war. Speaking to a national TV audience from Bagram Air Base, he suggested that America?s experience in Afghanistan had come full circle. ?One year ago, from a base here in Afghanistan, our troops launched the operation that killed Osama bin Laden,? he said. ?The goal I set  ?   to defeat Al Qaeda, and deny it a chance to rebuild  ?   is now within our reach. ? Earlier, Mr. Obama had met for an hour with Mr. Karzai. The two had long had a rocky relationship  ?   on an earlier trip, Mr. Obama excoriated Mr. Karzai for the rampant corruption in the Afghan government  ?   and this session did little to improve their rapport. Mr. Crocker recalled that the president was ?very aloof, almost cold, which bothered me a bit because I?d worked a solid damn year to get Karzai in a better place with us. ? Things never warmed up between them. When Mr. Karzai refused to sign a   security agreement with Washington, Mr. Obama gave up on him to focus on his successor, Ashraf Ghani. The experience left a lasting imprint on the president, his aides said. He concluded that without the right partner, it was impossible for the United States to succeed, no matter how much blood and treasure it poured into a country. It was an insight that Mr. Obama applied to his relations with other countries, from Pakistan to Israel, where his poor relationships with the leaders impeded progress. ?The most underappreciated part of foreign policy,? Mr. Rhodes said, ?is dealing with flawed partners. ? When Mr. Obama convened his National Security Council that day in August 2015, the Taliban were regrouping again. They had carried out audacious terrorist attacks in the center of Kabul and had mounted a military offensive in the provinces of Kunduz and Oruzgan. Worse, there was a new threat in the form of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, which sprouted in the poisonous soil of Iraq after the United States left and was finding recruits in the Hindu Kush. Mr. Obama had rejected a chorus of calls in Washington to delay the drawdown, under which the residual force of American troops was to leave Afghanistan by the end of 2016. ?The mantra I heard was that the president does not want to hand off to his successor the mess he inherited,? said Daniel F. Feldman, who served as the special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan in 2014 and 2015. But as the Islamic State became a dire enough threat to return American troops to Iraq, Mr. Obama felt compelled to change course on Afghanistan. ?ISIL thrived in a vacuum in Iraq and it pointed to a similar vacuum in Afghanistan,? Mr. Rhodes said. Mr. Obama, he said, was prodded by more than fear. After a long stretch of political paralysis, Afghanistan formed a government with Mr. Ghani in the presidency. For the first time since taking office, Mr. Obama felt like he had a partner with whom he could do business. The   Afghan Army was taking heavy casualties fighting the Taliban, and the president believed that the United States had an obligation to help them. But as Mr. Obama?s war council met that August morning, the level of American support remained the subject of intense debate. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. a skeptic about Afghanistan going back to 2009, argued that the country would revert to chaos, regardless of how long the United States stayed there. ?It doesn?t matter if we leave tomorrow or 10 years from now,? he declared, according to those in the room. He was, he conceded, a ?broken record? on this issue. Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, who had succeeded Admiral Mullen as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, recommended that the United States maintain a military presence in Kabul, and at Bagram and a scattering of bases in the east and south. The 10, 000 soldiers in the country would carry out a singular, ruthless mission of killing suspected terrorists and keeping the country from spiraling out of control. The imperative, General Dempsey told Mr. Obama, was that Afghanistan fit into a broader counterterrorism policy from Central Asia to North Africa to extend ?well beyond your presidency,? according to several officials. Mr. Obama liked that idea. It was in line, he said, with the principles he had laid out in a 2014 speech at the United States Military Academy in West Point, N. Y. where he said America would train and equip foreign armies but leave the   fighting to them. He acknowledged that it would mean handing off Afghanistan to his successor as unfinished business. ?This goes to the politics of what I?m leaving for the next president,? he told the group, according to one of the participants. ?My interest is not to sign them up for 10 years of X,? he added, referring to troop numbers, ?but to lay out a vision and to put stakes in the ground for that vision. ? Mr. Obama now seems at an uneasy peace. In the interview in September, he disputed the suggestion that his policy had failed. He had, after all, reduced the number of American troops to fewer than 10, 000 from more than 100, 000. They were training and assisting Afghan troops, even if the line between that and actual combat was sometimes blurry. The country had been broken to begin with, he said, and America was never going to fix it. ?Afghanistan was one of the poorest countries in the world with the lowest literacy rates in the world before we got there. It continues to be,? Mr. Obama said. The country ?was riven with all kinds of ethnic and tribal divisions before we got there. It?s still there. ? In the end, Afghanistan became the template for a new kind of warfare  ?   a chronic conflict, across an arc of unstable states, in which the United States is a participant, if not the principal actor. At a NATO summit meeting in Warsaw in July, Mr. Obama acknowledged that this prospect would disappoint an American public still suffering from combat fatigue. ?It?s very hard for us ever to get the satisfaction of MacArthur and the emperor meeting, and a war being officially over,? he said. ?As commander in chief of the most powerful military in the world,? he went on, ?I spend a lot of time brooding over these issues. And I?m not satisfied we?ve got it perfect yet. ?"
17805,Brooke Jarvis,21/01/2017,2017,1,entertainment,"In the fall of 2012, a    fisherman and carver named Terry St. Germain decided to enroll his five young children as members of the Nooksack, a federally recognized Native American tribe with some 2, 000 members, centered in the northwestern corner of Washington State. He?d enrolled his two older daughters, from a previous relationship, when they were babies, but hadn?t yet filed the paperwork to make his younger children  ?   all of whom, including a set of twins, were under 7  ?   official members. He saw no reason to worry about a bureaucratic endorsement of what he knew to be true. ?My kids, they love being Native,? he told me. St. Germain was a teenager when he enrolled in the tribe. For decades, he used tribal fishing rights to harvest salmon and sea urchin and Dungeness crab alongside his cousins. He had dozens of family members who were also Nooksack. His mother, according to family lore, was directly descended from a   Nooksack chief known as Matsqui George. His brother, Rudy, was the secretary of the Nooksack tribal council, which oversaw membership decisions. The process, he figured, would be so straightforward that his kids would be certified Nooksacks in time for Christmas, when the tribe gives parents a small stipend for buying gifts: ?I thought it was a    situation. ? But after a few months, the applications had still not gone through. When Rudy asked why, at a tribal council meeting, the chairman, Bob Kelly, called in the enrollment department. They told Rudy that they had found a problem with the paperwork. There were missing documents ancestors seemed to be incorrectly identified. They didn?t think Terry?s children?s claims to tribal membership could be substantiated. At the time, Rudy and Kelly were friends, allies on the council. At the long oval table where they met to discuss Nooksack business, Rudy always sat at Kelly?s right. But the debate over whether Rudy?s family qualified as Nooksack tore them apart. Today, more than four years later, they no longer speak. Rudy and his extended family refer to Kelly as a monster and a dictator he calls them pond scum and con artists. They agree on almost nothing, but both remember the day when things fell apart the same way. ?If my nephew isn?t Nooksack,? Rudy said in the council chambers, ?then neither am I. ? To Rudy, the words were an expression of shock. ?It?s fighting words,? he said, to tell someone they?re not really part of their tribe. At stake were not just his family?s jobs and homes and treaty rights but also who they were and where they belonged. ?I?ll still be who I am, but I won?t have proof,? Rudy said. ?I?ll be labeled a  . So yeah, I take this very personally. ? To Kelly, the words were an admission of guilt, implicating not just the St. Germains but also hundreds of tribal members to whom they were related. As chairman, he felt that he had a sacred duty: to protect the tribe from invasion by a group of people that, he would eventually argue, weren?t even Native Americans. ?I?m in a war,? he told me later, sketching family trees on the back of a copy of the tribe?s constitution. ?This is our culture, not a game. ? The St. Germains? rejected application proved to be a turning point for the Nooksack. Separately, the family and the council began combing through Nooksack history, which, like that of many tribes in the United States, is complicated by government efforts to extinguish, assimilate and relocate the tribe, and by a dearth of historical documents. An international border drawn across historically Nooksack lands only adds to the confusion. There were some records and even some living memories of the ancestors whose Nooksack heritage was being called into doubt. But no one could agree on what the records meant. In January 2013, Kelly announced that, after searching through files at the Bureau of Indian Affairs office in nearby Everett, he had reason to doubt the legitimacy of more than 300 enrolled Nooksacks related to the St. Germains, all of whom claimed to descend from a woman named Annie George, born in 1875. In February, he canceled the constitutionally required council meeting, saying it would be ?improper? to convene when Rudy St. Germain and another council member, Rudy?s cousin Michelle Roberts, were not eligible to be part of the tribe they?d been elected to lead. A week later, he called an executive session of the council but demanded that St. Germain and Roberts remain outside while the rest of the council voted on whether to ?initiate involuntary disenrollment? for them and 304 other Nooksacks, including 37 elders. The resolution passed unanimously. ?It hurt me,? Terry St. Germain said later. Even harder was watching the effect on his brother, Rudy. ?It took the wind right out of him. ? Two days after the meeting, the tribal council began sending out letters notifying affected members that unless they could provide proof of their legitimacy, they would be disenrolled in 30 days. Word and shock spread quickly through the small,   reservation. The disenrollees, now calling themselves ?the Nooksack 306,? hired a lawyer and vowed to contest their expulsion. ?I told ?em, ?I know where I belong no matter what you say,??u2009? an    woman who, in her youth, had been punished for ?speaking Indian? at school, said. ??u2009?You can?t make me believe that I?m not. ??u2009? The Nooksacks who want the 306 out of the tribe say they are standing up for their very identity, fighting for the integrity of a tribe taken over by outsiders. ?We?re ready to die for this,? Kelly would later say. ?And I think we will, before this is over. ? Outside the lands legally known as ?Indian Country,? ?membership? and ?enrollment? are such blandly bureaucratic words that it?s easy to lose sight of how much they matter there. To the 566 federally recognized tribal nations, the ability to determine who is and isn?t part of a tribe is an essential element of what makes tribes sovereign entities. To individuals, membership means citizenship and all the emotional ties and treaty rights that come with it. To be disenrolled is to lose that citizenship: to become stateless. It can also mean the loss of a broader identity, because recognition by a tribe is the most accepted way to prove you are Indian  ?   not just Nooksack but Native American at all. Efforts to define Native American identity date from the earliest days of the colonies. Before the arrival of white settlers, tribal boundaries were generally fluid intermarriages and alliances were common. But as the new government?s desire to expand into Indian Territory grew, so, too, did the interest in defining who was and who wasn?t a ?real Indian. ? Those definitions shifted as the colonial government?s goals did. ?Mixed blood? Indians, for example, were added to rolls in hopes that assimilated Indians would be more likely to cede their land later, after land claims were established, more restrictive definitions were adopted. In the 19th century, the government began relying heavily on blood quantum, or ?degree of Indian blood,? wagering that, over generations of intermarriage, tribes would be diluted to the point that earlier treaties would not have to be honored. ??u2009?As long as grass grows or water runs?  ?   a phrase that was often used in treaties with American Indians  ?   is a relatively permanent term for a contract,? the Ojibwe author David Treuer wrote in a 2011   for The Times. ??u2009?As long as the blood flows? seemed measurably shorter. ? Even for those early rolls, though, determining blood quantum was tricky it was not a measure that tribal people used or something they kept track of. Government agents compiling base rolls in the 1800s sometimes simply guessed at the percentage of Indian blood at the time, anthropologists used feet and hair width as a ?scientific? test of blood degree in indigenous tribes. Many traditionalist Indians, known as ?irreconcilables? or ?blanket Indians,? were so suspicious of the government that they refused to be enrolled at all, making all their descendants unenrollable as well. In 1988 the historian Kent Carter coined a   term for the millions who claim Indian ancestry but who, for a variety of reasons, don?t sort neatly into today?s official boxes: people with mixed tribal heritage people whose ancestors were denied recognition by early government agents or died before registration was complete people whose tribes, in the face of the federal government?s attempts to extinguish them, didn?t maintain the cohesion that same government would later require for recognition. Carter called them the ?outalucks. ? Contemporary Indian identity is refracted through a tangled accumulation of   and   understandings of biology and race, as well as several centuries? worth of conflicting federal policies. The Constitution uses the word ?Indian? twice but never bothers to define it. A congressional survey in 1978 found that, in addition to the different requirements used by tribes and individual states, federal legislation defined Native Americans in at least 33 ways. In 2005, one frustrated judge, quoting an earlier decision, described the legal definitions of   as ??u2009?a complex patchwork of federal, state and tribal law,? which is better explained by history than by logic. ? Given the web of criteria, courts are sometimes called upon to decide whether individuals, or even tribes, are ?authentically? Indian. This has led to weighing things like whether   128ths constitutes a ?significant degree? of Indian blood (a federal court ruled in 2009 that it did) whether someone who was ?Indian in an anthropological or   sense? was also Indian for the purposes of criminal jurisdiction if his tribe isn?t federally recognized (the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decided he was not) and whether behaviors like eating fast food and driving cars show that a tribe?s culture had been abandoned and its land rights ?extinguished? (in 1991, a Canadian court said that they did the ruling was later overturned). Modern Native Americans  ?   who in 2017 are still issued cards by the federal government certifying their ?Degree of Indian Blood?  ?   are used to, if not necessarily comfortable with, the need to ?prove? their identities in ways that may seem strange to people of other ethnicities. Tribes set their own membership requirements, but in order to be recognized by the federal government, they must also prove their historical continuity and have generally hewed to the methods it has established. Tribes have on occasion been warned that federal recognition, and thus their   rights, can disappear if their membership becomes unclear. When, in 1994, the Blackfeet Nation considered doing away with its   requirement, a Bureau of Indian Affairs official warned that a tribe that ?diluted? its relationship with its members might find that ?it has ? ? its sovereignty away. ? Today, most tribes use direct descent from tribal members listed on historical rolls and blood quantum. For a 2003 book, ?Real Indians: Identity and the Survival of Native America,? the Cherokee scholar Eva Marie Garroutte interviewed Native people about what it felt like to be defined in this way. Many said they saw blood quantum as a helpful guidepost and a guard against fraud or against people who identify as Indian without cultural understanding. Others regarded it as odd, even offensive. An Ojibwe man joked that he is also ?part white, but I don?t have the papers to prove it. ? A    woman replied, ?I don?t like being talked about in a vocabulary usually reserved for dogs and horses. ? Lately, though, old debates about identity have taken a harsh new direction. Loss of tribal acceptance, which was once rare and seldom permanent, has become increasingly common over the last two decades. David Wilkins, a professor of American Indian studies at the University of Minnesota who has followed the phenomenon since the   says there has been a surge in disenrollment that involves between 5, 000 and 9, 000 people in 79 tribes across 20 states. Even the dead have been disenrolled and, in some cases, exhumed from their graves, against tradition and taboo, to have their DNA tested. The ejection of tribal members is most prevalent in small tribes with casinos on their land ?per capita? profit shares go further when split fewer ways. Many of the most famous cases have been in California: Following the opening of a new tribal casino in 2003, the Chukchansi, in Coarsegold, disenrolled more than half of approximately 1, 600 tribal members, and battles among factions eventually led to an armed takeover of the casino. But disenrollment also happens where casino money isn?t a major factor (the Nooksack have one casino and another recently closed, but don?t make enough money from gaming to issue per capita payments) or isn?t a factor at all, as in tribes where factions hope to consolidate political power or settle grudges or simply believe that people were mistakenly let in. Robert Williams, chairman of the Indigenous Peoples Law and Policy Program at the University of Arizona, told me that some tribes have recently begun to hire membership consultants to help trim their rolls. ?It?s almost become an industry in some parts of Indian Country,? he said. The National Native American Bar Association issued a resolution in 2015 denouncing loss of membership without due process, while the Association of American Indian Physicians warned that such loss of identity could cause serious grief and depression. In general, though, the voices against disenrollment have been few. A 1978 Supreme Court decision, Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, held that, due to its sovereignty, a tribe cannot be sued for discrimination for accepting the children of male members who married outside the tribe but not those of female members who did. It has been widely interpreted as giving tribes the right to determine their membership requirements, even if individual rights are compromised. The Bureau of Indian Affairs, out of respect for sovereignty, has repeatedly declined to intervene in internal membership disputes. Native leaders, leery of inviting scrutiny that could undermine tribal sovereignty, have been reluctant to speak out. ?They tend to view any interference in such matters as an intrusion of the thin end of an infinitely expandable wedge against which they must exercise constant vigilance,? writes Garroutte. Ron Allen, the chairman of the Jamestown S?Klallam  ?   a Western Washington tribe that disenrolled six members for insufficient blood quantum  ?   says that ?the topic is rising? and eliciting strong emotions, but it?s not appropriate to tell other tribes what to do: ?It would be like Oregon saying to Washington, ?You?re not managing your affairs properly. ??u2009? Of the sweeping lands that historically made up Nooksack territory  ?   it once stretched from the glaciated heights of Mt. Baker to the rocky shores of Puget Sound  ?   the tribe now owns about 2, 500 acres, bought from private owners in the last 50 years. The reservation is centered in Deming, an unincorporated town of a few hundred people, with pockets of tribal housing scattered beyond it. Most Nooksack tribal members do not live on the reservation many of them, or their ancestors, followed opportunities in the more developed southern Sound or in other parts of the country. Adelina   64, lives across the Sound, closer to the Olympic Mountains. A   of Annie George, the common ancestor who unites the Nooksack disenrollees, and a cousin of Rudy and Terry St. Germain?s mother, she was among the first of the 306 accepted as Nooksack decades ago. One afternoon as we sat on her porch watching ships come and go from Seattle, she showed me the letter the tribe sent her in 1983, announcing her new membership. Overhead, a bald eagle wheeled inside, her husband, a painter, made sketches for a portrait of Annie George. He was working from an old, grainy photograph that he wasn?t sure depicted George. A relative found it in a shed, and the features were indistinct. ?Once you title something,? he said, laughing, ?it is what you say it is. ? After she got her letter of acceptance,   recalled, she was quick to tell her family, and then to write back to the enrollment director: ?We were all jubilant, laughing, full of joy, jumping, screaming, crying, and the greatest overwhelming feeling of belonging somewhere. ? She was proud, she wrote, to finally know where she came from, ?and prouder still to be a Nooksack Indian. ?   didn?t set out to be a member of the Nooksack tribe. She grew up well south of Nooksack lands, following her parents as they sought work in the fields, orchards and canneries of Washington State. Her father was Filipino and her mother was Indian, raised on a Shxway reserve in British Columbia. Her mother always said she was part Shxway, a Canadian band within the Stolo nation, through her grandfather, and part Nooksack, through her grandmother Annie George. Annie George?s three daughters  ?    ?s grandmother and her two aunts  ?   all married Filipino farmworkers. The family spoke Halkomelem, a native language that was widely spoken in what is now British Columbia but also in the Nooksack River valley until the   century it eventually largely replaced the original Nooksack language, Lhechalosem. As a child,   would sometimes drive north with her mother to visit family, and they would stop off in Nooksack territory to visit a man they called Uncle Louis. In 1983,   her mother and one of her   decided they wanted to learn more about their heritage. They went to the Bureau of Indian Affairs office in Everett, Wash. and then to the Nooksack enrollment office in Deming, to work on a family tree.  ?s mother told the enrollment director that her grandmother?s name was Annie George, and that her grandmother?s siblings had been named Louis, Amanda, Frank and William. Annie George wasn?t on the family trees the tribe had, and she wasn?t listed on any of the censuses it used, but Louis George was on a Nooksack tribal census from 1942. In a probate document, they found Annie?s name: Four interviewees described her as Louis?s half sister. The enrollment director encouraged the women to apply for membership, and they did. Within a month, the council sent them word that they had been accepted.   was the 777th enrolled member of the Nooksack tribe. Many of her relatives quickly followed. (Some also enrolled, separately, as Shxway.) As more houses became available, more members of the three families moved to reservation lands. Before long, the descendants of Annie George became an influential voting bloc, and their members were being elected to council seats and hired to run tribal offices. While some elders welcomed them, others were skeptical. The sisters had never lived on Nooksack land. Some elders had no memory of them others remembered them visiting but thought of them as Shxway. Kelly heard, indirectly, that elders in British Columbia didn?t remember the sisters? being born there, but rather, showing up suddenly as young children  ?   the beginning of his suspicions that, though they ?had teachings,? the sisters weren?t Annie?s real daughters at all but   children she had taken in. Roberts showed me copies of two of the sisters? birth certificates, reissued later in their lives, listing Annie and her husband as their parents. Other members of the tribe remembered knowing some of the 306 further south in the 1950s, when their families were doing agricultural work at the time, they said, the families identified as Filipino. They certainly hadn?t been around in the 1960s or ?70s, when the tribe was writing its constitution  ?   when, as Kelly put it, the council ?took a look around at who was here when they passed it, and they wrote their criteria for that, based on who was here  ?   this is who Nooksack?s going to be. ? The debate continued into the 1990s, when the tribe did an enrollment audit of one of the three families descended from Annie?s daughters, the Rabangs. They were ultimately found to be enrollable, but not before an ugly confrontation. In 2000, after a number of Rabangs were arrested for smuggling marijuana into the United States from Canada, some elders told The Associated Press that ?a clan of outsiders masquerading as Nooksacks? was ?controlling tribal government. ? Bob Kelly now calls   and the other first enrollees from her extended family ?Trojan horses. ? The Nooksack, as is the case with many tribes, have not always been known by their modern name. Rather, Nooksack, which is also rendered Noxwsÿ7aq, was the name of one of many villages scattered along what is now called the Nooksack River. When white settlers arrived in the   century, they applied the name of the village to all the people in the valley. Noxwsÿ7aq translates to ?always bracken fern roots,? on which people of the village are said to have subsisted during a time of famine. One tribal member told me that she thinks the name captures something of what it means to be Nooksack. It makes her feel like a survivor. That?s a fair description of Nooksack history, especially in the last few hundred years. For centuries, the people fished their own river valley but also traveled regularly, including to what is now Canada?s Fraser River, to fish for salmon or gather shellfish. They intermarried and formed alliances with their neighbors on both sides of what is now an international border. When white settlers arrived and introduced new diseases, many of the Nooksack died. By some counts their numbers plummeted to 450 from perhaps 1, 200. In the 1855 Treaty of Point Elliot, in which Coast Salish tribes ceded their lands to the federal government in exchange for small reservations and the right to continue fishing, hunting and gathering, the Nooksack received no reservation. Instead, as settlers moved onto their lands, they were told to go live with the Lummi, in their new reservation by the coast. Most refused. Of those who remained, some filed homestead claims on their own lands others scattered in search of a livelihood. For the next hundred years, as far as the federal government was concerned, the tribe essentially ceased to exist. This is not an unusual story. The federal government used the law as ?a mighty, pulverizing engine to break up the tribal mass,? as Teddy Roosevelt said to Congress in 1901. He was referring to the General Allotment Act, under which tribally owned land was carved into small parcels and handed out to individuals. It was a huge blow to the stability and sovereignty of tribes: Within 20 years, Native people lost ownership of 90 million acres. It was also the beginning of the government?s reliance on blood quantum to determine Indian status. Those deemed ? ? or less were regarded as more responsible and given more freedom to handle their land. Even many ?progressive? reformers saw assimilation into white society as the best way to transform tribal members into citizens. ?Kill the Indian in the student so we can save the man!? went the famous slogan of a superintendent at one of the 500 boarding schools that Native children, forcibly separated from their families, were made to attend. Some Nooksack people, unrecognized by the federal government, stayed on their lands and continued to operate as a tribe. In the 1920s, they joined other Northwest tribes to sue the federal government for lands lost in the 1930s, even though they weren?t considered eligible to participate, they voted to accept the Indian Reorganization Act, in which the government backed away from its assimilationist policies and instead encouraged tribes to be   and  . (A decade later the United States ended its    relationships with tribes and returned to promoting assimilation, before changing its policies and pushing   again.) In the 1960s, a committee of Nooksacks opened a bid for federal recognition. They gained title to one acre of land in Deming, the first Nooksack Reservation, in 1970, and full federal recognition in 1973. Like many tribes, they adopted a constitution based on a model that the Bureau of Indian Affairs developed during the reorganization period in the 1930s. The new constitution restricted Nooksack membership to recipients of early land allotments, recipients of a 1965 government settlement or people who appeared on a 1942 tribal census. Their direct descendants could also be enrolled, provided they had ?at least   ( ) degree Indian blood. ? The Nooksack weren?t alone in seeing   applicants turn up after the tribe was officially recognized. Ron Allen, the tribal chairman of the Jamestown S?Klallam, told me it was common, in the last decades of the 20th century, for the ?  communities? of northwestern tribes to be surprised by a ?wave? of people who started coming back to places their families once left. He credits the political advancement of tribes, which made members of the broader society feel that it was ?O. K. to be Indian. ? Tribes generally welcomed the new arrivals, he said, but still, ?it was like, ?Where are all these Indians coming from? ??u2009? The most outspoken critics of disenrollment call it a form of genocide. Others don?t go quite so far but still view the practice as an outgrowth of policies designed to suppress Native American identity  ?   ?to control us, to assimilate us, and ultimately, to extinguish us,? as John McCoy, a Washington State senator and member of the Tulalip Tribes, neighbors to the Nooksack, wrote in an   for the Indian Country Media Network earlier this year. Robert Williams, of the University of Arizona, argues that disenrollment is a remnant of ?colonialism and good   American racism, with Indians left to deal with the mess. ? In a 2015 tweet, Sherman Alexie, the Spokane and Coeur d?Alene author, put it even more emphatically: ?Dear Indian tribes who disenroll members, you should be ashamed of your colonial and capitalistic bullshit. ? The first person to reply to Alexie?s tweet  ?   thanking him for speaking out when others were silent  ?   was Gabe Galanda, a member of the Round Valley Indian tribes in California and the lawyer whom the Nooksack 306 hired to represent them. The next replies came from some of Galanda?s other clients: former members of the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde, who were disenrolled in 2014. Grand Ronde was formed in 1857 when the federal government forced at least 27 tribes and bands to leave their homelands, which ranged from California to Washington, and move to a reservation in Oregon. The 86 Grand Ronde disenrollees descend from a man known as Chief Tumulth, who signed one of the treaties that created the reservation. Decades after they enrolled, tribal officials noted that Chief Tumulth failed to appear on the official base roll, made the year it was founded. It was true: He was hanged the year before, by a lieutenant of the U. S. Army. I thought of this last spring as I watched   leaf through old letters and family trees, newspaper clippings and documents. ?We didn?t make the laws,? she said. ?We just got stuck in the middle. ? After the first disenrollment letters went out to Nooksack members, Galanda appealed to tribal courts and the Department of the Interior and managed to delay the disenrollment hearings. Meanwhile, the 306 tried to make sense of what documents they could find to illuminate their past. They had no birth certificate for Annie, so they turned to old censuses and to   church records kept by the Archdiocese of Vancouver, marking the sacraments of birth, marriage and death. They found that Annie?s birth mother, Marie Siamat, was buried in December 1875, two days after giving birth to Annie, and that her father (variously recorded as Chief Matsqui, George Kot kro itmentwh, George Roelkwemeldon, George Tekwomclko, George Matsqui and so on) remarried a woman named Madeline Jobe. Indian censuses taken during Annie?s childhood repeatedly recorded her living with George and Madeline. Michelle Robert?s grandmother remembers her mother, Annie, referring to Madeline as the woman who raised her and as ?Mother. ? The 306 think this is compelling evidence Madeline adopted Annie. The council remains unconvinced. Kelly says that citing Madeline as an ancestor  ?   their only tie to recognized base rolls  ?   was a blatant lie. If Madeline didn?t count, the family responded, they should still qualify for membership under Section H of the Nooksack constitution, which allows the enrollment of ?persons who possess at least ª Indian blood and who can prove Nooksack ancestry to any degree. ? Records indicate that Matsqui was considered a Nooksack village even after the Canadian border was established to the south, and Matsqui George was a chief of the village. In a U. S. census from 1910, Louis George indicated that both his parents, Madeline and Matsqui George, were Nooksacks from Washington, and that he was a   Nooksack. Besides, the 306 like to point out, Kelly?s own family was adopted by the Nooksacks it is originally from a different Canadian tribe. Kelly suggested that the 306 disenroll themselves and reapply under Section H. But he soon called for a referendum to remove Section H from the Nooksack constitution. He said later that this change was unrelated to the 306 and was instead a   tightening of loose enrollment laws that could have let ?almost anybody? in. The amendment passed with 61 percent support. As part of their defense, the 306 produced letters from anthropologists. One cited not just the requirements for Nooksack membership provided in tribal code but ?historical documents, family oral history and   concepts of identity, affiliation and membership within anthropology regarding the social organization of the Coast Salish peoples. ? But for some tribal members, this only served to undermine his case. ?It?s not a club,? a woman named Mary Brewer, who recently gave up her membership in the Lummi tribe to enroll as a Nooksack, told me. ?My mom has about 10 different tribes in her ancestry, and she meets the requirements for only two. ? Their family lost title to 80 acres on the Yakima reservation because they didn?t have high enough blood quantum to be enrolled there they were sorry to lose the land, she said, but respected the rules by which modern tribes operate. Brewer?s mother, Diane, said she had two grandchildren whose blood quantum is  . ?We?ve been telling them, better marry Native or else it?ll die out,? she said. ?The 306 say, ?Disenrollment isn?t traditional,??u2009? Mary said. ?Well, enrollment was never traditional!? It is, however, the way things work now. ?It?s not, ?this guy took care of me, and that?s how we did it in the olden days,??u2009? Brewer continued. ?If you don?t have documentation, then you?re not Indian. ? In more than 30 years of membership, Annie?s descendants became interwoven in the life of the tribe. They married other Nooksacks and had kids those kids had kids. But once the disenrollment process began, people chose sides. ?It was just like a light switch,? Elizabeth Oshiro, one of the 306, told me. People she knew for years ?all of a sudden had a different heart. ? With the hearings repeatedly delayed as lawsuits made their way through the tribal court system, both sides formed Facebook groups to argue their cases and regularly debated or taunted each other online. (Their competing slogans were ?We Belong? and ?We Are Nooksack. ?) ?While some people challenge the idea of tribal enrollment, referring to it as ?Western thinking? and an imposed system on American Indians,? posted Katrice Romero, the tribe?s housing director, ?that tribal enrollment number is what holds the United States government accountable to the American Indian people and its trust responsibility to tribes a responsibility that my ancestors fought, struggled and sacrificed for. ? On the reservation, Michelle Roberts found that people who babysat for her as a child or attended her wedding would no longer make eye contact with her. ?The most important thing isn?t friendship,? says Diane Brewer, who no longer speaks to her former best friend, one of the 306. ?The most important thing is the tribe. ? In the summer of 2013, Roberts was fired from her job as the   manager at the Nooksack River Casino. Later, when she tried to count the number of disenrollees and their allies who lost tribal jobs, she got to 58. At first, Kelly told me he wouldn?t comment on personnel decisions but later said, ?We got rid of all them a long time ago. ? Rudy St. Germain was fired from his job as the casino?s landscaping manager and had to move his two boys into a relative?s house when he couldn?t make rent. ?Those were dark days,? he told me. Today he works i"
18390,Carl Hulse,9/02/2017,2017,2,business,"WASHINGTON  ?   Although there is plenty of anxiety in Washington about the shaky early performance of the Trump administration, don?t count Senator Mitch McConnell among the hand wringers. Mr. McConnell, a Kentucky Republican and the majority leader, says he and his Senate Republican colleagues are quite satisfied with the Trump team so far. In fact, he said, they are reassured by signs that President Trump is going to hew to a conservative agenda after early fears that the president  ?   a relatively unknown quantity to most elected Republicans  ?   might not really be one of them. ?The country doesn?t need saving,? Mr. McConnell said when asked during an interview in his Capitol office if there was any cause for a   congressional intervention given early chaos in the evolving West Wing. ?I think there is a high level of satisfaction with the new administration,? he said, dismissing concerns about dissonant eruptions from the new president and some of his top staff members. ?Our members are not obsessed with the daily tweets, but are looking at the results. ? He added: ?No matter what sort of theatrics that go on around the administration, if you look at the decisions that are being made, they are solid  ?   from our perspective  ?      things that we would have hoped a new Republican president would have done. ? Mr. McConnell has broken with the president on a few subjects, taking a much harder line against President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia than Mr. Trump has and objecting to some of the president?s ?drain the swamp? initiatives, including a proposal for congressional term limits. Other members of the Republican establishment  ?   inside and outside Congress  ?   have expressed growing alarm about the conduct and competence of the White House. But Mr. McConnell, whose wife, Elaine Chao, was named by Mr. Trump as secretary of transportation, said things might even be turning out better than anticipated. ?Back during the campaign, there were a lot of questions: Is Trump really a conservative? A lot of questions about it,? Mr. McConnell recalled. ?But if you look at the steps that have been taken so far, looks good to me. ?It is the kind of thing we would have expected of one of the others, had they been nominated and elected,? Mr. McConnell said, referring to Republican presidential candidates defeated by Mr. Trump who had more conventional political and government backgrounds. Mr. McConnell?s view clashes violently with that of Senate Democrats and their allies around the country. They have viewed the beginning of the Trump era as a disaster best exemplified by an immigration executive order they decry as unconstitutional and   as well as a selection of cabinet choices they rate as unqualified and carrying the very same baggage that has prevented others from being confirmed in the past. Even some Republicans have criticized as inept and amateurish the rollout of the immigration order, which is now at the center of a federal court fight. Others have expressed trepidation at the prospect of being hammered in a Trump tweet if they run afoul of the new president. Mr. McConnell, who is known for being able to take the temperature of his colleagues and to act accordingly, said he sensed no real unease about Mr. Trump on the Republican side of the aisle. ?We have had very good unity on our side,? Mr. McConnell said. ?People are genuinely excited about taking the country in another direction. I don?t find any decision that he has made surprising. ? He said Senate Republicans had been enthusiastic about Mr. Trump?s cabinet nominees, dazzled by his Supreme Court pick and elated at the chance to roll back what he called the regulatory rampage of the Obama administration. ?A lot of us were wondering, what is Trump really going to be like?? Mr. McConnell said. ?He used to support Democrats and have various views earlier in his life about politics. But when he got to the point of actually having the office and making the decisions, I think the decisions have been very comforting to my members, most of whom are a little bit right of center and further right of center. ? It goes without saying that having Mr. Trump in the White House gives House and Senate Republicans the opportunity to pursue an aggressive legislative agenda if they can find common ground. That prospect should be heightened by installing colleagues like Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama and two fellow Republicans, Representatives Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina and Tom Price of Georgia, at the highest levels of the administration. Mr. Sessions is Mr. Trump?s nominee for attorney general while Mr. Mulvaney has been tapped to run the White House Office of Management and Budget and Mr. Price to head the Department of Health and Human Services. Mr. McConnell looms as potentially the president?s most important ally in Congress because success in the Senate is central to any legislative victory. But Republicans have not even started on the legislative end of the new Congress. Now their job is going to be made more difficult by the increasingly hard line that Democrats are taking against Mr. Trump by opposing his cabinet nominees en masse. Mr. McConnell?s frustration at Democratic tactics boiled over Tuesday evening when he invoked a rarely used Senate rule to force Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, to end a speech on the grounds she was impugning the integrity of Mr. Sessions, a fellow senator, by criticizing his record on civil rights. ?It is a superficially poisonous atmosphere, not a fundamentally poisonous atmosphere,? Mr. McConnell said. Still, he noted that Republicans could do much of their preliminary work in the Senate just by relying on their party?s 51 votes there as they take up health care, tax changes and nominations, and could try to work out the differences with Democrats later. ?Sooner or later we will get around to things that will require some level of cooperation,? Mr. McConnell said. ?Hopefully there will be a kind of dysfunction fatigue. I think it will set in way before then. ? His point raises a question: Will that same passage of time produce a kind of Trump fatigue among the   congressional Republicans?"
18165,Eric Schmitt and David E. Sanger,5/02/2017,2017,2,business,"WASHINGTON  ?   Just five days after taking office, over dinner with his newly installed secretary of defense and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, President Trump was presented with the first of what will be many    decisions: whether to approve a commando raid that risked the lives of American Special Operations forces and foreign civilians alike. President Barack Obama?s national security aides had reviewed the plans for a risky attack on a small, heavily guarded brick home of a senior Qaeda collaborator in a mountainous village in a remote part of central Yemen. But Mr. Obama did not act because the Pentagon wanted to launch the attack on a moonless night and the next one would come after his term had ended. With two of his closest advisers, Jared Kushner and Stephen K. Bannon, joining the dinner at the White House along with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr. Mr. Trump approved sending in the Navy?s SEAL Team 6, hoping the raid early last Sunday would scoop up cellphones and laptop computers that could yield valuable clues about one of the world?s most dangerous terrorist groups. Vice President Mike Pence and Michael T. Flynn, the national security adviser, also attended the dinner. As it turned out, almost everything that could go wrong did. And on Wednesday, Mr. Trump flew to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to be present as the body of the American commando killed in the raid was returned home, the first military death on the new commander in chief?s watch. The death of Chief Petty Officer William Owens came after a chain of mishaps and misjudgments that plunged the elite commandos into a ferocious   firefight that also left three others wounded and a $75 million aircraft deliberately destroyed. There are allegations  ?   which the Pentagon acknowledged on Wednesday night are most likely correct  ?   that the mission also killed several civilians, including some children. The dead include, by the account of Al Qaeda?s branch in Yemen, the    daughter of Anwar   the   Qaeda leader who was killed in a targeted drone strike in 2011. Mr. Trump on Sunday hailed his first counterterrorism operation as a success, claiming the commandos captured ?important intelligence that will assist the U. S. in preventing terrorism against its citizens and people around the world. ? A statement by the military?s Central Command on Wednesday night that acknowledged the likelihood of civilian casualties also said that the recovered materials had provided some initial information helpful to counterterrorism analysts. The statement did not provide details. But the mission?s casualties raise doubts about the months of detailed planning that went into the operation during the Obama administration and whether the right questions were raised before its approval. Typically, the president?s advisers lay out the risks, but Pentagon officials declined to characterize any discussions with Mr. Trump. A senior administration official said on Wednesday night that the Defense Department had conducted a legal review of the operation that Mr. Trump approved and that a Pentagon lawyer had signed off on it. Mr. Trump?s new national security team, led by Mr. Flynn, the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency and a retired general with experience in counterterrorism raids, has said that it wants to speed the   when it comes to such strikes, delegating more power to   officials so that the military may respond more quickly. Indeed, the Pentagon is drafting such plans to accelerate activities against the Qaeda branch in Yemen. But doing that also raises the possibility of error. ?You can mitigate risk in missions like this, but you can?t mitigate risk down to zero,? said William Wechsler, a former top counterterrorism official at the Pentagon. In this case, the assault force of several dozen commandos, which also included elite soldiers from the United Arab Emirates, was jinxed from the start. Qaeda fighters were somehow tipped off to the stealthy advance toward the village  ?   perhaps by the whine of American drones that local tribal leaders said were flying lower and louder than usual. Through a communications intercept, the commandos knew that the mission had been somehow compromised, but pressed on toward their target roughly five miles from where they had been flown into the area. ?They kind of knew they were screwed from the beginning,? one former SEAL Team 6 official said. With the crucial element of surprise lost, the Americans and Emiratis found themselves in a gun battle with Qaeda fighters who took up positions in other houses, a clinic, a school and a mosque, often using women and children as cover, American military officials said in interviews this week. The commandos were taken aback when some of the women grabbed weapons and started firing, multiplying the militant firepower beyond what they had expected. The Americans called in airstrikes from helicopter gunships and fighter aircraft that helped kill some 14 Qaeda fighters, but not before an   Osprey aircraft involved in the operation experienced a ?hard landing,? injuring three more American personnel on board. The Osprey, which the Marine Corps said cost $75 million, was badly damaged and had to be destroyed by an airstrike. The raid, some details of which were first reported by The Washington Post, also destroyed much of the village of Yakla, and left senior Yemeni government officials seething. Yemen?s foreign minister, Abdul Malik Al Mekhlafi, condemned the raid on Monday in a post on his official Twitter account as ?extrajudicial killings. ? Baraa Shiban, a Yemeni fellow for Reprieve, a   human rights group, said he spoke by phone to a tribal sheikh in the village, Jabbr Abu Soraima, who told him: ?People were afraid to leave their houses because the sound of choppers and drones were all over the sky. Everyone feared of being hit by the drones or shot by the soldiers on the ground. ? After initially denying there were any civilian casualties, Pentagon officials backtracked somewhat on Sunday after reports from the Yemeni authorities begin trickling in and grisly photographs of bloody children purportedly killed in the attack appeared on social media sites affiliated with Al Qaeda?s branch in Yemen. Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said on Monday that some of the women were combatants. The operation was the first known   ground mission in Yemen since December 2014, when members of SEAL Team 6 stormed a village in southern Yemen in an effort to free an American photojournalist held hostage by Al Qaeda. But the raid ended with the kidnappers killing the journalist and a South African held with him. That mission and the raid over the weekend revealed the shortcomings of secretive military operations in Yemen. The United States was forced to withdraw the last 125 Special Operations advisers from the country in March 2015 after Houthi rebels ousted the government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, the Americans? main counterterrorism partner. The loss of Yemen as a base for American counterterrorism training, advising and   was a significant blow to blunting the advance of Al Qaeda?s branch in the country and keeping tabs on their plots. The Pentagon has tried to start rebuilding its counterterrorism operations in Yemen, however last year, American Special Operations forces helped Emirati troops evict Qaeda fighters from the port city of Mukalla."
17706,Adam Goldman and Alan Blinder,17/01/2017,2017,1,crime,"WASHINGTON  ?   The F. B. I. arrested the wife of the man who carried out a deadly terrorist attack in Orlando, Fla. and charged her with obstructing the investigation of the mass shooting, law enforcement officials said on Monday. Noor Salman, whose husband, Omar Mateen, killed 49 people and wounded dozens in an Orlando nightclub that was popular with gays, was also charged with aiding and abetting by providing material support, the officials said. She was taken into custody by F. B. I. agents at her home outside San Francisco, where she had been living with her young son. Prosecutors had been weighing charges against her for months in the aftermath of the attack by her husband on June 12, 2016. Investigators interviewed Ms. Salman for hours after the attack and came to believe she was not telling the truth about her husband?s plans to carry out the rampage. A Justice Department spokesman said Ms. Salman would make her initial appearance on Tuesday morning in federal court in Oakland, Calif. The Justice Department?s decision to prosecute Ms. Salman, 30, ends part of the mystery that has surrounded her since the first days after the attack, when she became a central subject of the   investigation into her husband. ?Noor Salman had no foreknowledge nor could she predict what Omar Mateen intended to do that tragic night,? said her lawyer, Linda Moreno. ?Noor has told her story of abuse at his hands. We believe it is misguided and wrong to prosecute her and that it dishonors the memories of the victims to punish an innocent person. ? The aiding and abetting, a terrorism charge, suggests that prosecutors believe that Ms. Salman helped him in some way  ?   either before or after the terrorist attack. The decision to charge her is not without risks for prosecutors. If the case goes to trial, prosecutors will have to contend with a jury that could be sympathetic to Ms. Salman, who said she was in an abusive relationship and living in fear. In an interview last year with The New York Times, Ms. Salman said she was ?unaware of everything? in connection with the attack. Ms. Salman said she had accompanied her husband to Orlando with their child once when he scouted the club but did not know the purpose of the trip. On the day her husband drove to Orlando, she claimed he said he was going to visit a friend, named Nemo, who lived in Florida. But Nemo was not living in Florida at the time, a fact Ms. Salman said she did not know. She also said she had no reason to suspect that ammunition he bought in the days leading up to the attack was to be used in the shooting, given that her husband was a security guard who frequently purchased ammunition. On the day of the shooting, she bought her husband a Father?s Day card, expecting him to return that evening. Her lawyers believe that supports her story that she did not know about the attack. During his rampage, Mr. Mateen used Facebook to pledge his allegiance to the Islamic State. President Obama has said that Mr. Mateen ?took in extremist information and propaganda over the internet and became radicalized. ? Federal investigators do not believe that Mr. Mateen, who was 29 and who was killed by the police after the shooting, received any specific training or support from the Islamic State. Part of their inquiry has focused on whether anyone in the United States assisted in his plans for the attack. There has perhaps been no figure more central to those questions than Ms. Salman, who grew up in an   home in Rodeo, Calif. near San Francisco. In Rodeo, on a diverse block populated by Chinese, Indian, Korean and Mexican families, neighbors recalled a younger Ms. Salman as warm and kind. Ms. Salman married Mr. Mateen in a ceremony near her childhood home in Northern California, a second marriage for both. After the wedding, Ms. Salman moved to Fort Pierce, Fla. where she and Mr. Mateen lived in a condominium complex. Their marriage in 2011 caused consternation among some of Ms. Salman?s relatives, mostly because of her Palestinian heritage and Mr. Mateen?s ancestral ties to Afghanistan. Ms. Salman said in the interview with The Times that her husband beat her repeatedly and verbally abused her. Members of Mr. Mateen?s family, who have tried to shield Ms. Salman from public scrutiny, have said they believe she did nothing improper. ?She is shocked, that poor lady,? Seddique Mateen, Mr. Mateen?s father, said in June 2016. ?And she doesn?t know anything. ? The Orlando police chief, John W. Mina, said in a statement that he was ?glad to see? that Ms. Salman had been arrested. ?Nothing can erase the pain we all feel about the senseless and brutal murders of 49 of our neighbors, friends, family members and loved ones,? the chief said. ?But today, there is some relief in knowing that someone will be held accountable for that horrific crime. ? In two recent mass shootings, prosecutors have brought charges against people with ties to the attackers. In South Carolina, a friend of Dylann S. Roof, who was convicted of killing nine people on June 17, 2015, in a Charleston church, pleaded guilty in April to lying to federal investigators and misprision of a felony, or failing to inform authorities that a felony had been committed. The friend did not testify against Mr. Roof, who was sentenced to death last week. In 2015, the federal authorities in California brought charges against a neighbor of the husband and wife who killed 14 people and wounded 22 others in San Bernardino. The man, who bought the rifles used in the attack on Dec. 2, 2015, was accused of lying on forms filled out in connection with the purchase. Although he was also accused of planning a terrorist attack several years ago, the man was not charged with having a direct role in the San Bernardino rampage. However, federal prosecutors in the summer of 2014 declined to prosecute Katherine Russell, the wife of one of the assailants in the Boston Marathon bombing on April 15, 2013. F. B. I. agents believed she had made false statements to investigators and concealed knowledge of a crime."
18377,Tim Casey,8/02/2017,2017,2,business,"BOSTON  ?   During a men?s hockey game between Boston University and Providence College in early December, Brittany Miller sat in the press box near center ice. She tracked statistics and typed notes in her laptop. Across the rink, Theresa Feaster kept a close eye on the game, logging video of the action. They could have been mistaken for reporters or merely diligent fans. But Miller and Feaster are much more than devoted followers of their beloved teams. They are    trailblazers. Last fall, Miller and Feaster became the first women to serve as   members of an N. C. A. A. Division I men?s hockey coaching staff when they were hired by their alma maters. But Miller, Boston University?s director of hockey operations, and Feaster, the coordinator of hockey operations at Providence College, say their gender rarely comes up in conversations with coaches or players. ?I?m just on the staff and come to work every day and work hard,? Feaster said. ?That?s all there is to it. It?s not really something that crosses my mind. ? Miller and Feaster had noticed each other during games when they both worked as student managers, first as undergraduates and then as graduate students. But they did not formally meet until a meeting of the Hockey East Association, the teams? conference, after both had been hired full time. ?It?s nice to have someone else who worked hard as a manager and proved herself to her coaching staff,? Miller said. ?It shows that Hockey East is really moving forward in hiring females. ? Each has been around hockey for as long as she can remember, though they came to their new jobs from opposite directions. Miller grew up on the ice, learning to skate at age 3 and playing competitive hockey through her high school years at Boston Latin School. Feaster did not play, but she began learning the game while bouncing around the minors with her father, Jay, and gained a newfound interest when his job as general manager of the Calgary Flames led to a connection to Providence while she was studying there. Miller, who had followed her older brother into the game and was coached by her father, started working as a manager at B. U. during the first semester of her freshman year, attending all of the Terriers? practices and games while still managing a full class load. She was finishing up her master?s degree and working as an intern for a sports marketing research company in London last summer when she received calls from Coach David Quinn and the athletic director, Drew Marrochello. The Terriers had an opening on their coaching staff, and both men thought Miller was the perfect candidate. Now she is in charge of all of the teams? travel logistics, ensures players handle their academic work and helps track statistics. Miller said Quinn and the rest of the staff had treated her as an equal since she accepted the job in September. ?They trust me to do a good job, and they know that I can do this job just as good if not better than any guy,? she said. Marrochello said he had known early on that Miller would be successful in any endeavor she chose. ?I?m frankly glad it is in hockey, in college sports,? he said. ?I know she?s got a high ceiling. ? While Miller?s love for hockey has burned since her youth, Feaster?s was more like rekindling an old flame. As a young child in the   Feaster was a regular at the rink and aboard the team bus when her father was the general manager of the Hershey Bears of the American Hockey League. Jay Feaster remembered his    daughter sitting on the training table talking hockey with Mitch Lamoureux, a center who had played parts of three seasons in the N. H. L. but was by then a   lifer on the wrong side of 30. ?I?ll see that in my mind until the day I die,? Jay Feaster said. ?It was like two players just sitting there having a conversation. ? As Theresa Feaster grew older, she would pepper her father, who helped the Tampa Bay Lightning win the Stanley Cup as their general manager in 2004, with questions about the game. But she did not think seriously about getting involved in the sport until she attended the 2012 N. H. L. draft. Jay Feaster was Calgary?s general manager at the time, and the Flames selected two players who ended up at Providence. Theresa Feaster introduced herself to Friars Coach Nate Leaman, told him that she was entering her junior year and asked if she could volunteer with the team. She was soon attending coaches? meetings and helping the program with anything it needed. She made such a good impression that Leaman hired her full time in October. Her new role is similar to the one she had as a student. She works on video and statistics projects, makes travel arrangements and helps with administrative tasks. ?I feel like every day I?m learning more,? Feaster said. ?One of the rewarding parts of this job is you come to the rink every day and you know that you?re going to learn and you?re going to get better. I find that incredibly rewarding. ? Although Miller and Feaster are technically members of their programs? coaching staffs, N. C. A. A. rules prohibit anyone in their position from working with players on the ice or sitting on the bench during practices or games. Still, they are interacting with the coaches and players daily and gaining valuable experience. Both women aspire to management roles and, possibly, the N. H. L. They would again be an anomaly: Few women have worked in   roles in an N. H. L. front office, and none have been a general manager. Jay Feaster has spoken with his daughter about the grueling nature of hockey: the scarcity of   positions, the long hours and the lack of job security. It is not an easy road, but if it is the one she chooses, she is off to a good start. ?I give her a hard time about, ?You?re too smart to be in this racket. Do you want to be in the hockey business? You?re too smart for that,?? Jay Feaster said. ?But I?m very, very proud. ?"
17328,John Otis,2/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"In 2007, Rey Canunayon and his wife, MaryGwen, immigrated to the United States from the island of Mindanao in the Philippines. In doing so, they were fulfilling their family?s dreams. For years, her parents had requested that the Canunayons join them in New York City. But her parents died before that could happen. Mr. Canunayon felt remorse about not honoring their wishes while they were alive. Still, he and his wife wanted to embark on the adventure and make the move. ?America is a great nation, a kind nation, a nation of greener pastures and milk and honey and endless possibilities,? Mr. Canunayon said. When the couple arrived, they stayed with Ms. Canunayon?s family in New Jersey. Life was exciting, even relaxing, Mr. Canunayon said. But as they settled in a new country, he struggled to find work and grew despondent. ?Oh, my God, I have cried a river because I was in a depression,? said Mr. Canunayon, now 46. He found relaxation riding the subway, one station to the next, so long as it kept moving. ?When you come from a place where you are so familiar, your own country, you have friends, relatives, connections, a career. And then you?re stripped of everything except your dignity it?s really hard,? he said. Eventually, the couple were able to move into an apartment of their own in Elmhurst, Queens. They also secured employment. He works at a   laundry, while his wife, 49, is a babysitter, a midwife and a nanny. In October 2015, they received their green cards. Beyond that, Mr. Canunayon, who left a career in nonprofit work in the Philippines, has recommitted himself to working to help people and neighborhoods change for the better. Only this time, he is not collecting a paycheck for it. ?God gave knowledge for free, skills for free, talent for free, so I?ll give it for free,? Mr. Canunayon said. He volunteers at the couple?s place of worship in Elmhurst, St. Adalbert Roman Catholic Church. He also helps other Filipino immigrants. ?I cannot imagine myself not sharing the skills and   talent that I have,? he said. But because this effort doesn?t come with a salary, it doesn?t help pay the bills. It took one episode, when the Canunayons received a $600 medical bill for lab tests in September, for them to plummet into financial instability. ?It was a big problem, Mr. Canunayon said. ?What will happen to us if we can?t pay the rent?? He came across a possible solution on one of his volunteer outings for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn and the Filipino Consulate, where he was helping people renew their passports. He mentioned his financial problems to Greg Hankins, a volunteer he had met that day. Mr. Hankins encouraged him to contact another group, Community Health Advocates. It is operated by the Community Service Society, one of eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. The Community Service Society did help, providing $641. 45 in Neediest Cases money to cover the couple?s outstanding medical bills. They also got help obtaining health insurance. While grateful for the assistance, they continue to worry about everyday challenges: making ends meet, sending money back to their families and carefully monitoring their finances. ?It?s the same situation, financially struggling and trying to get myself back into the saddle,? Mr. Canunayon said. He continues to search for jobs in the nonprofit sector. In the Philippines, he worked in research, advocacy and policy legislation, which led to the development of sustainable organic agriculture to feed the poor. The cause was personal: Many members of his family are farmers. He has not given up hope that he will find a job that lets him continue his passion for service while providing a decent income. ?I would be killing myself if I did something else,? he said. ?It would deplete my energy. When you work on the things you most love doing, it?s not work. ?"
17345,Benjamin Mueller and Al Baker,4/01/2017,2017,1,crime,"A steep drop in gang violence last year drove shootings in New York City to the lowest number in at least a   Police Department data shows, a result of what police officials say has been a focus on gang takedowns and targeted arrests in some of the city?s roughest neighborhoods. The internal police data, obtained by The New York Times, paints a detailed portrait of the motives, locations and circumstances behind murders and shootings for the last two years.   shootings fell to 412 in 2016, from 560 the year before, according to the data, which tracked shootings and murders through Dec. 28 of each year.   killings dropped to 79 in 2016, from 129 in 2015. Those   helped push citywide shootings to a new low of 998 by year?s end, police officials said, down from 1, 138 in 2015. Murders also fell, to 335 from 352 the year before. The New York City police commissioner, James P. O?Neill, has noted the department?s efforts to push shootings below 1, 000 for the first time since at least the early 1990s, when the police began keeping similar records. Mr. O?Neill and Mayor Bill de Blasio were expected to discuss those efforts at a news conference in Brooklyn on Wednesday. Scores of gang takedowns this year, resulting in about 900 arrests, took violent people off the streets and made it more costly to engage in   crimes, police officials said. ?Precision policing targets those people who are responsible for the violence, which in a significant amount of cases are gangs,? said Stephen P. Davis, the department?s chief spokesman. ?By going after the gang members, arresting them, we recognize the resultant reduction in violence. ? Violent crime has been more persistent  in some communities, especially outside Manhattan. But the Police Department, in continuing to drive down crime even as it has pulled back from heavy   enforcement and aggressive tactics like    has shown the value of focusing resources on stopping serious crime, said David M. Kennedy, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. ?New York City, in many ways, convinced the rest of the country that things like zero tolerance were the way to make communities safe,? he said. ?And now it?s showing the country that you absolutely do not need to do that, you should not do it, and there are much, much better and less damaging ways to work with communities to produce public safety. ? The reductions in New York stand in stark contrast to some other cities, most notably Chicago, which had a sharp increase in murders and shootings in 2016 and ended the year with 762 homicides. The New York Police Department data offers a rare glimpse into the more granular ways that the department?s Detective Bureau tracks and classifies crime, as well as the   tangle of reasons that people are shot and killed. Shootings and murders dropped across almost every category of motive last year. Murders in which drugs were the primary motive, for example, dropped to 29 in 2016, from 42 the year before. But domestic killings rose slightly, to 57 last year from 49 in 2015. Criminologists believe gang enforcement can result in arrests of people who are also domestic offenders, but they say that domestic violence remains more difficult to prevent, because it can escalate inside homes, without the police being notified. Mr. Kennedy said that efforts in smaller jurisdictions across the country to respond to the earliest signs of domestic violence and to punish repeat offenders were showing results, but that those strategies would be more difficult to replicate in a city the size of New York. Fewer people were murdered with guns in 2016, but the number of people killed by cutting rose to 73, from 50 the year before. Murders and shootings on the street, in public housing and in commercial locations all dropped last year through Dec. 28. Murders on playgrounds climbed to 12, from three the year before, and also rose in dwellings and in vehicles. More broadly, murders indoors ticked up by 19, while outdoor murders fell by 49. About a third of shootings and murders occurred between 10 p. m. and 2 a. m. and more than half happened between 6 p. m. and 2 a. m. The biggest share of murders were motivated by what the police call a ?dispute. ? Of those, the largest share had to do with words that were exchanged, followed by disputes over a man or woman, over money, and over a previous history. Five murders in 2016 were deemed to be motivated by a stare or a disrespectful act, two by gambling and two by road rage. Just under a third of the shooting cases last year were closed with an arrest, and 22 percent of the cases were closed because the police had exhausted all leads. Forty percent of the murder cases were closed with an arrest, and eight others were termed an exceptional clearance, a category that would include cases in which the person suspected of being the killer was murdered before an arrest was made."
17429,Liz Spayd with Evan Gershkovich,6/01/2017,2017,1,entertainment,"We hope you got some rest over the holidays, but it?s clear from our mailbox that you remained sharp and attentive readers. We will address a few of those complaints first, before turning to this week?s topics. A   Social Q?s column, which administers lighthearted advice about awkward social situations, addressed what an adult should do when one child taunts another at a holiday party. The specific taunt in question, which was directed toward a Latina girl, was this: ?Pack your bags. Trump is going to send you back to Mexico. ? The headline on the column? ?Should I Stay Silent During One Child?s Populist Taunt of Another?? Readers took issue with the description of the taunt. The author of the column, Philip Galanes, took the time to reply to a reader who wrote to him directly. Shortly before the new year, an ad ran on a Times story that left some readers befuddled. The ad was indeed a hoax, and readers who realized this have asked The Times to address the issue. Indeed, such ads do seem to find their way onto the Times website occassionally, as a public editor column explained in November, but we asked Sebastian Tomich, senior vice president for advertising and innovation, to comment once more. Here?s his response: An hour into the new year, tragedy struck in Turkey when a gunman attacked an Istanbul nightclub. The lead byline on The Times?s story was anonymous  ?   ?an Employee of The New York Times?  ?   and readers had theories as to why. The public editor?s take: We?ve received several letters asking about the unusual byline. The international editor, Michael Slackman, said he?s not in position to comment but I suspect you are hinting at the right issues in your letter. From my experience, it is not uncommon to use a generic byline when the security of journalists may be at risk, or when a widespread team of editors and reporters is assembling a deadline story. But I?m only speaking for myself, not the paper. Just last week, a Wall Street Journal reporter was detained by Turkish officials for three days and held in isolation. The same story caught readers? attentions for other reasons, too. Initially, the story reported that the single gunman may have been as many as three gunmen, and they were wearing Santa Claus suits, an image which stayed with readers. The Times, however, never appended a correction to the story nor added a note explaining the change. We asked Slackman about this. Here?s his response: The public editor?s take: Time for me to make my plug again for attaching notes to stories that undergo a notable change from a previous edition. This wasn?t just a routine change in a rapidly unfolding story. It was a rather dramatic visual  ?   a team of men in Santa Claus suits firing into the crowd. If that turned into one man dressed like the crowd, as later stories suggest, isn?t it more transparent just to flag that? Another reader raised an issue that will hopefully be addressed in the new year. We asked Alexandra MacCallum, who oversees Times video, for an answer. She told us that while some videos have text overlay, which editors add manually, an automated closed caption system is in the works this year. As trust in the media falters, a reader has taken a stand, one friend at a time. He wrote us to ask for our aid in his mission. We, of course, pointed him to their location on the web, and if you have any upcoming debates, too, you can find The Times?s standards and ethics here. Good luck, and see you next week."
18395,Scott Shane,9/02/2017,2017,2,crime,"WASHINGTON  ?   Margaret Thatcher famously declared that ?we must try to find ways to starve the terrorist and the hijacker of the oxygen of publicity on which they depend. ? In a speech 32 years ago, Mrs. Thatcher, the British prime minister facing a threat from the Irish Republican Army, said she was not calling for censorship but proposing that ?a voluntary code of conduct? for journalists might keep them from aiding ?the terrorists? morale or their cause. ? It was a   statement of a familiar point, one made repeatedly in the decades since: that the news media plays a crucial role in amplifying the effect of terrorist violence and giving it exactly the political import the terrorists crave. So for some experts who study terrorism, President Trump?s assertion this week that the news media has actually been ignoring and covering up terrorist attacks came as a surprise. ?It?s totally astonishing,? said Martha Crenshaw, a Stanford scholar who has written on terrorism since the 1970s. ?It has no basis in fact whatsoever. The criticism has always gone the other way. ? Other experts said Mr. Trump?s claim had less to do with the facts about terrorism coverage than with the new administration?s political goals, notably defending his executive order that temporarily bans refugees and visitors from some Muslim countries. In the face of the onslaught of legal challenges and outspoken opposition to the order, they said, the president has an interest in persuading Americans that the terrorist threat from abroad is worse than the news media has revealed. Years of books and articles critiquing the ?symbiosis? of terrorism and news media coverage have pointed out that terrorists usually seek to promote a political or ideological cause and use spectacular violence with the specific goal of attracting attention. News executives, while sometimes expressing mixed feelings about giving terrorists what they seek, have generally felt obligated to give such attacks ample coverage. ?It?s incredible to say that the media does not give enough attention to terrorism,? said David C. Rapoport, a retired U. C. L. A. political science professor considered a founder of terrorism studies. He said modern global terrorism arose in the 1880s in Russia in parallel with, and partly owing to, the rise of mass daily newspapers. In the United States since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, even failed terrorist plots often have drawn saturation coverage  ?   think of the fizzled   underwear bomb on a   airliner on Christmas Day 2009 or the S. U. V.   to blow up that produced only smoke in Times Square on a May night in 2010. Though no target was harmed, both attempts drew mountains of coverage, much of it focused on how terrorists went undetected. But in an appearance Monday at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Fla. Mr. Trump reviewed the horrors of more recent attacks, including those inspired or directed by the Islamic State, and pronounced the coverage inadequate. ?Radical Islamic terrorists are determined to strike our homeland as they did on   as they did from Boston to Orlando to San Bernardino,? he said at the headquarters of Central Command, which carries out military operations in the Middle East. ?All over Europe it?s happening. It?s gotten to a point where it?s not even being reported and, in many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn?t want to report it. They have their reasons, and you understand that. ? The president did not explain the reasons he believed journalists might have for not reporting Islamist terrorism. But in response to a wave of skeptical comment, the White House on Monday night released a list of 78 attacks around the world since September 2014. ?Most have not received the media attention they deserved,? the accompanying statement said. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, stood by the point on Tuesday, though adjusting the language. ?It?s becoming too often that we?re seeing these attacks not get the spectacular attention that they deserve,? he said. ?And I think it undermines the understanding of the threat that we face around this country. ? It was a subjective judgment only a dozen of the 78 listed attacks occurred in the United States, and most resulted in few or no deaths, reducing their prominence in American news reports. The list omitted terrorist attacks by   including white supremacists like Dylann S. Roof, who killed nine   at a Charleston, S. C. church in 2015. But news databases show virtually all 78 attacks got some coverage, and the big attacks in Paris Brussels Boston San Bernardino, Calif. and Orlando, Fla. played out for days or weeks on cable television and news sites. Peter D. Feaver, a political scientist at Duke who studies public opinion on national security issues, said he saw no basis for the White House claims. ?I don?t think there?s evidence of the press underreporting terrorism,? he said. ?The corporate incentives run the other way. ? But Mr. Feaver, who served in the George W. Bush White House but publicly opposed Mr. Trump during the presidential campaign, said the president?s remarks, if not literally true, nonetheless play out in a larger, partisan debate about terrorism. Democrats sometimes accused the Bush administration of exaggerating the terrorist threat. Republicans often charged President Barack Obama of minimizing the danger and embellishing his own successes against Al Qaeda. By suggesting that the news media is hiding the truth about the menace from ?radical Islamic terrorists,? Mr. Trump may rally his base behind the executive order and other measures still to come. Mr. Spicer suggested as much, saying the executive order and the president?s remarks in Tampa have the same motive: ?because he cares about making sure that we don?t have attacks in this country, that we?re protected. ? Mr. Trump wants Americans, he said, to ?understand the unwavering commitment that the president has and the actions that he will take to keep the country safe. ? Preventing terrorist attacks is, of course, a goal that is pretty much universally shared. But Mr. Trump?s loose relationship with facts, and his eagerness to fault journalists and judges, make some think he has a less lofty goal as well: to find scapegoats for terrorist attacks that sooner or later are certain to happen. ?  blame,? said Ms. Crenshaw, the Stanford terrorism researcher. ?Nothing?s happened. But if something does happen, he can blame the judiciary and the news media. ?"
17313,Sheri Fink and Helene Cooper,5/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"The body of the Iraqi prisoner was found naked and badly bruised in 2003, outside a detention center in southern Iraq run by United States Marines. The    man had been beaten, deprived of sleep, forced to stand for long periods and interrogated by Marines about his alleged role in a fatal ambush of American forces. James N. Mattis,   Donald J. Trump?s nominee for secretary of defense, was then a major general and the commander of the Marine division in Iraq responsible for the center. He quickly convened an inquiry into the death, which led to   and banned the harsh techniques used at the prison. ?General Mattis was all up in arms over this,? Ralph Dengler, then a lieutenant colonel, testified at a military hearing in January 2004. He added that the commander, who arrived hours after the discovery on a planned visit with his British counterpart, had immediately described the death as ?the worst thing that happened? under his watch in the Iraq war. ?I was surprised that he would have felt that strongly about it, considering many of the other deaths, including American deaths,? Colonel Dengler said. Colleagues say the general?s handling of the episode reflects his firmly held views against torture and prisoner mistreatment, which are shared by many military leaders and could put them at odds with the new commander in chief. Mr. Trump, in a New York Times interview in late November, said he had been surprised to learn that the man he was considering to lead the country?s 2. 2 million service members did not believe in torture. During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump advocated bringing back the   practice of waterboarding, adding that ?only a stupid person would say it doesn?t work. ? General Mattis does not support abusive techniques, let alone waterboarding. ?Give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers,? he told Mr. Trump during their meeting in November, according to the   ?and I do better with that than I do with torture. ? The general?s beliefs were shaped by his military training, but also by his experiences in dealing with issues related to torture or mistreatment, according to an examination of his nearly   career and interviews with former colleagues and friends. General Mattis led the United States Central Command from August 2010 to March 2013. Lt. Col. T. G. Taylor, who was General Mattis?s spokesman during much of that time, said in an interview that the commander had spoken of America as needing to hold the moral high ground. Failing to uphold important principles ?makes it easier for a soldier or a Marine to ask, ?What am I fighting for? ?? Colonel Taylor said. ?That is something that General Mattis is keenly aware of,? he added. As a young officer, General Mattis would have been instructed in the laws of war, including the Geneva Conventions, which, among other protections, require humane treatment of prisoners of war. A Marine who enlisted in 1969 while attending college  ?   part of an R. O. T. C. program during the height of the Vietnam War  ?   he did not deploy to Vietnam. But, several friends say, he believed that American prisoners of war were more likely to be tortured by the Vietcong if the United States tortured enemy captives. In 2006, General Mattis supported Gen. David H. Petraeus of the Army and other military leaders in the development of a new counterinsurgency field manual that highlighted limits on interrogation tactics. ?Torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment is never a morally permissible option, even if lives depend on gaining information,? the manual said. ?Lose moral legitimacy, lose the war. ? General Mattis later agreed in a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing that it was inappropriate for the military to support the use of abusive techniques on detainees  ?   including waterboarding, forced nudity and sensory deprivation, tactics inflicted on prisoners during interrogations in secret C. I. A. prisons in the years after the 2001 terrorist attacks. Those techniques had been modeled on a military training program operated by the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency, which later fell under the general?s command. That program, Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape, also known as SERE, exposed United States soldiers and other service members to techniques that an enemy violating the laws of war might use so that Americans could be better prepared to resist them. The experience typically led trainees to conclude that tortured prisoners of war will say whatever they need to in order to stay alive, whether true or not. A recent investigation by The New York Times found that many terrorism suspects subjected to harsh tactics in C. I. A. jails or American military prisons had lasting mental health problems that were similar to those experienced by some American former P. O. W.s who suffered horrific abuses in Vietnam or Korea. As a commander in Afghanistan and later in Iraq, and as an overall leader of the American war effort, General Mattis often grappled with the consequences of the C. I. A. ?s treatment of prisoners and the harsh conditions at the military detention center at Guantÿnamo Bay, Cuba. They became a powerful recruiting tool for jihadis who threatened American forces in the field. Testifying at a Senate hearing in 2015 after his retirement, General Mattis opposed the release, before the end of hostilities, of prisoners who had fought against the United States. However, he added, they should be treated humanely, in accordance with international and domestic law. ?I would go by the Geneva Conventions, and maintain them, with Red Cross oversight, until the war is over,? he told lawmakers. Torture is not effective in eliciting intelligence, the general felt. ?For his whole career, he?s believed that it just doesn?t pay dividends,? said a retired senior United States military officer who is close to General Mattis but spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of alienating Mr. Trump. The ?pack of cigarettes? reference, according to people who served with the general, reflects two tenets that are drummed into future military leaders: that information gleaned from torture is unreliable, and that   can go a long way. ?I?m not in his head, but what General Mattis was saying is that offering a modicum of friendship and humanity to someone in a desperate situation is more successful than physical torture,? Colonel Taylor said. Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump?s transition team, declined requests for more detail on the  ?s discussions with General Mattis or on the source of General Mattis?s beliefs and any further thoughts Mr. Trump has had about the use of torture. General Mattis declined to be interviewed. Many American military leaders maintain that the Bush administration?s departure from established practices in allowing harsh coercive techniques  ?   government lawyers had said they did not meet the legal definition of torture, and had declared that detainees were not protected by the Geneva Conventions  ?   tainted the United States? reputation while not yielding results. ?Ineffective, war crime, against our values, moral high ground, et cetera,? Donald J. Guter, a retired rear admiral and the dean of the South Texas College of Law, said in explaining objections to brutal treatment. ?A very practical reason is that it opens the door for our own troops to be tortured, and we have no basis to object. If we torture, we?ve lost who we are. ? The Department of Defense has clear policies on the humane treatment of detainees. For example, the Army field manual?s section on intelligence collection states: ?Use of torture is not only illegal but also it is a poor technique that yields unreliable results. ? The manual adds, ?Cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment is prohibited. ? As a commander in Iraq, General Mattis ordered several investigations into detainee abuse. One of the most significant concerned the 2003 death at a makeshift detention and interrogation center in an abandoned Iraqi Army barracks in southern Iraq, christened Camp Whitehorse. Prisoners were held by United States Marine reservists in extreme heat in a dirty, stone building that had been looted of all amenities by Iraqis during the   invasion. The prisoner who died, Nagem Sadoon Hatab, had been arrested days earlier on suspicion of involvement in a deadly ambush of a United States Army convoy that led to the capture of Jessica Lynch, a    private who was later rescued. Mr. Hatab was alleged to have killed American service members and sold an   rifle taken from one of them. Mr. Hatab failed to stand up while being subjected to     treatment  ?   forced standing for 50 minutes of each hour, for up to 10 hours. The objective was to make the detainees tired, stressed and submissive for interrogators, witnesses later said in military court hearings. Like other prisoners at the center, Mr. Hatab was hooded and his hands were restrained behind his back with plastic ties. He was beaten severely by Marine guards after refusing to comply with the forced standing and  . He also underwent questioning by a special Marine interrogation squad. A Marine guard later testified that he had often heard yelling, screaming and banging from the interrogation room, a converted bathroom. After midnight on June 6, 2003, Mr. Hatab was found dead in a courtyard where he had been left lying for hours, his body covered in his own feces. An armed forces medical examiner categorized the death as a homicide. Mr. Hatab had six broken ribs and had suffocated from a broken bone in his throat after being dragged outside by his neck, the examiner concluded. Eight Camp Whitehorse personnel were charged with crimes, including negligent homicide. But the investigator appointed by General Mattis, Col. William B. Gallo, later cited problems with the autopsy and could not determine which of the attacks on Mr. Hatab, if any, might have been lethal. In Colonel Gallo?s opinion, the   treatment did not amount to torture, but the command had failed to provide adequate predeployment training in handling prisoners and in the law of war. Evidence, including certain photographs of the prisoner and a summary of an interrogation he underwent, had been lost or destroyed, complicating the investigation and prosecution. Two Marines, a major and a sergeant, were eventually convicted of lesser charges. Mr. Hatab?s death clearly had an effect on General Mattis. According to reports at the time, he ordered a review of the procedures for handling prisoners, which resulted in a ban of   tactics, including the forced standing. Marine Corps personnel running detention camps were given more training, and a manual was compiled to explain each step of the process. Still, there were several other instances of prisoner abuse involving the division. Later, aiming to earn the trust of the Iraqi people after the first phase of combat had ended, General Mattis added an addendum to the motto of his Marines: ?No better friend, no worse enemy. ? The addition was, ?First, do no harm. ?"
17689,Adam Kirsch,19/01/2017,2017,1,crime,"American novelists have long complained about the ability of real life to outstrip fiction. In his landmark 1961 essay ?Writing American Fiction,? Philip Roth observed that ?actuality is continually outdoing our talents, and the culture tosses up figures almost daily that are the envy of any novelist. ? The figure Roth cites is Charles Van Doren, of   scandal fame but place Mr. Van Doren next to Donald J. Trump, and you can measure the change in the nature of credibility over the past  . Mr. Van Doren was disgraced when it was revealed that he had been given the answers to the questions on the game show ?? a contest that television viewers believed was real, not staged. Today an entire flourishing genre of television goes by the name ?reality,? yet no one who watches it thinks it is genuinely real  ?   that is, unplanned and unedited. Artificiality is what makes reality television enjoyable, even though these same shows, if advertised as fiction, would appear banal, repetitive and undramatic. Reality is the ingredient that turns a bad fiction into an enthralling one. This dynamic is part of the novel?s origins. The earliest English novels, from ?Moll Flanders? (1722) to ?Clarissa? (1748) were published anonymously, with titles that implied they were true stories. It took generations to establish the conventions of fiction sufficiently to allow readers to take pleasure in novels that were explicitly untrue. The suspension of disbelief that fiction involves is a late stage in the evolution of taste, and it may prove to have been a temporary one. The rise of the memoir over the past few decades doesn?t mean that readers are ready to abandon the techniques of fiction but, like readers three centuries ago, they want the freedom of fiction along with consequentiality of fact. The author David Shields diagnosed this desire in his 2010 manifesto ?Reality Hunger?: ?I find it very nearly impossible to read a contemporary novel that presents itself    as a novel. ? Many fiction writers share this intuition, though they respond to it in different ways. One way is to make the novel   by turning its imitation of reality into an exaggeration, a   mirror. Has our reality since   felt apocalyptic? Then imagine Manhattan being destroyed by zombies (Colson Whitehead?s ?Zone One?) or a flood (Nathaniel Rich?s ?Odds Against Tomorrow?) or civil war and foreign bankers (Gary Shteyngart?s ?Super Sad True Love Story?). Because we know such things ?could never happen,? they mark the story as fiction because we know similar things have happened and will happen, they become truthful fictions. An alternative approach is to make fiction as close to fact as possible, by reducing its scope to the one subject on which each writer is an unchallengeable authority: himself or herself. Ben Lerner?s ?10:04,? Tao Lin?s ?Taipei? and Sheila Heti?s ?How Should a Person Be?? all seek to convince us that we are reading about the writer?s actual life. These writers are engaged in a sophisticated project, in which the line between truth and fiction becomes harder and harder to make out. But this game has a    : Label a book ?fiction,? and all is forgiven. A fiction can never be accused of being a lie. The problem is that, more and more, people seem to want to be lied to. This is the flip side of ?reality hunger,? since a lie, like a fake memoir, is a fiction that does not admit its fictionality. That is why the lie is so seductive: It allows the liar and his audience to cooperate in changing the nature of reality itself, in a way that can appear almost magical. ?Magical thinking? is used as an insult, but it is perhaps the most primal kind of thinking there is. The problem for modern people is that we can no longer perform this magic naively, with an undoubting faith in the reality of our inventions. We lie to ourselves now with a bad conscience. When the memoir is exposed as not having ?really? happened, we want our money back. Fiction was one solution to this quandary, allowing us to suspend disbelief in the way that Coleridge said was essential for literature. But the postmodern solution is even more powerful: It is the simple shamelessness that allows us to recognize a lie as a lie but still treat it as if it were a reality. Reality shows are a trivial example of this technique, but when it comes to politics the same process can have deadly results. ?The Protocols of the Elders of Zion? was published, like ?Moll Flanders,? with no name on the title page it, too, claimed to be a true account of real events  ?   in this case, a meeting at which Jews plotted to take over the world and destroy civilization. Perhaps some of its readers, when it first appeared around 1903 and even today, sincerely believed that this was a real document. But the ?Protocols? is even more powerful when endorsed by people who know it is false, because such an act turns fact itself into an irrelevance. People who can turn a lie into a truth have the power to shape reality they are poets of the real. And the audience that gives them its willing suspension of disbelief is a   in this uncanny transformation, just as novel readers conspire in their enchantment. The bond between demagogues and their audience is cemented by their exhilarating consciousness of shared culpability. The problem with our ? ? politics is that a large share of the population has moved beyond true and false. They thrill precisely to the falsehood of a statement, because it shows that the speaker has the power to reshape reality in line with their own fantasies of   beleaguerment. To call novelists liars is na?ve, because it mistakes their intention they never wanted to be believed in the first place. The same is true of demagogues. From its beginning, the novel has tested the distinction between truth, fiction and lie now the collapse of those distinctions has given us the age of Trump. We are entering a period in which the very idea of literature may come to seem a luxury, a distraction from political struggle. But the opposite is true: No matter how irrelevant hardheaded people may believe it to be, literature continually proves itself a sensitive instrument, a leading indicator of changes that will manifest themselves in society and culture. Today as always, the imagination is our best guide to what reality has in store."
18030,Kimiko de Freytas-Tamura,28/01/2017,2017,1,business,"In 2004, France banned vending machines from schools. In 2011, it limited servings of french fries to once a week in school cafeterias. A year later, it imposed a ?soda tax. ? On Friday, the government said no  restaurants can offer free refills of sodas and other sugary drinks.  The new regulation is the latest attempt to tackle what the government called a relentless rise in the national obesity rate.   restaurants, usually foreign chains, are expected to be targeted under the new law. The law, which takes effect immediately, said it aimed to ?limit, especially among the young,? the risks of obesity and diabetes. The move by France is in line with recommendations by the World Health Organization, which has urged countries to impose a tax on sugary drinks to battle an increase in obesity, presenting data in 2016 on the beneficial health effects of such a tax. The French are, on average, less overweight than other Europeans and Americans. The share of obese adults (age 18 and older) in France was 15. 3 percent in 2014, just below the European Union average, 15. 9 percent, according to Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union. Malta has the highest share of adult obesity of European nations, 26 percent. In the United States, it is 36. 5 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While the overall adult obesity rate in France appears to be relatively low, 57 percent of men and 41 percent of women 30 to 60 years old were overweight or obese, according to a report released in October by Bulletin pid?miologique Hebdomadaire, the French medical journal. France has been at the forefront of tackling the issue, along with countries like Japan, where a national law requires companies and local governments to measure the waistlines of people between the ages of 40 and 74, and to encourage them to exercise. Mexico added a 10 percent surcharge on sugary drinks in 2014 to reduce alarming levels of diabetes there. After one year, sales of such beverages fell as much as 12 percent, while bottled water purchases rose 4 percent, a study found. Similar efforts are underway in the United States. Philadelphia became the first major city this year to introduce a tax on soda and other sugary drinks, provoking public outrage. In 2012, the New York City health board approved Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg?s plan to ban the sale of large sugary drinks in restaurants and other venues. But a court struck down the proposal in 2013. The Bloomberg administration appealed and lost. The new law has divided the French, who consume fewer soft drinks per capita than residents of most other countries. ?Each person has to take responsibility,? a    man told the newspaper Le Parisien. Restaurants ?might as well put scales in front of each   joint. ?"
17822,Richard P?rez-Pe?a,20/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"The legal record shows that Jerry Hartfield?s first murder conviction was thrown out on appeal, and for the next 32 years, he was not officially guilty of anything, not sentenced to anything. Yet he spent that time in Texas prisons, in what an appellate court now calls ?a criminal justice nightmare. ? He was finally tried and convicted again in 2015, but on Thursday, Mr. Hartfield moved closer to freedom than he has been in decades. A state Court of Appeals ruled that he was not only denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial, but to a degree the court had neither seen nor imagined before it noted that the important precedents dealt with delays of three years, six years, eight years  ?   not 32. The   panel dismissed the indictment against Mr. Hartfield, who is developmentally disabled, in effect erasing the recent conviction. But it is still not clear whether, or when, he will get out of prison. Prosecutors could appeal Thursday?s ruling to the Court of Criminal Appeals, Texas? highest criminal tribunal. The state Attorney General?s Office, which has argued against Mr. Hartfield, referred questions to the Matagorda County District Attorney?s Office, which did not reply to requests for comment. ?We are deeply mindful that our conclusion today means that a defendant who may be guilty of murder may go free,? Judge Gina M. Benavides wrote for the Court of Appeals. ?However, based on the United States Constitution, it is the only possible remedy. ? All told, Mr. Hartfield, now 60, has spent more than 40 years behind bars for the murder of a bus station ticket clerk. His case can seem like something out of absurdist fiction: a court ruling ignored or forgotten, an appeal dismissed by a court that agreed with the substance but said it had been filed under the wrong statute, a retrial after most of the evidence had been lost and witnesses had died, and an argument by prosecutors that Mr. Hartfield, himself, was to blame for the delays, and caused them intentionally. ?Once you call this Kafkaesque, you can?t really call anything else Kafkaesque, because there?s nothing else remotely like this,? said David R. Dow of the University of Houston Law Center, one of the lawyers who represented Mr. Hartfield on appeal. ?This was the perfect storm of everything that could go wrong with the criminal justice system. ? On Sept. 17, 1976, Eunice Lowe, a    white woman, was killed where she worked, the Continental Trailways station in Bay City, southwest of Houston. The killer bashed in her head with a pickax, stole money from the station and took her car, and there was evidence of sexual assault after death. Mr. Hartfield, a black man, signed a confession that he later disavowed, and, crucially, investigators said he told them where to find Ms. Lowe?s car. Experts placed his I. Q. in the 50s or 60s, which his lawyers contend made him easily coerced by detectives, and unable to understand his rights or his confession. A jury convicted him and he was sentenced to death. But the Court of Criminal Appeals later overturned that verdict, ruling that a potential juror had been improperly dismissed for having doubts about the death penalty, and ordered a new trial. After years of legal wrangling, the high court ruling took effect in March 1983. Under Texas law at the time, prosecutors had a way to avoid a retrial and preserve the conviction  ?   but only if they acted within a time frame set by the court. Because the trial error had to do with capital punishment, if the governor commuted the sentence to life in prison, then it would be as if the appellate court had never ruled, and the guilty verdict would remain in effect. That was apparently never communicated to the prison system. Mr. Dow said that Mr. Hartfield thought he was awaiting a new trial, but did not have the capacity to understand the delay or what to do about it. Whether the District Attorney?s Office understood what had happened at the time is unclear, but it never took steps to retry him, and the case lay dormant for the next 23 years. Prosecutors have argued that Mr. Hartfield had legal representation all along, because his original defense team remained his lawyers of record until a court formally dismissed them in 2013. But Mr. Hartfield?s new lawyers say he had no legal counsel from 1983, when the original team thought they were done with the case, until a federal court appointed a lawyer in 2008. Starting in 2006, a fellow inmate helped Mr. Hartfield file motions in various courts. Some were rejected outright, and at least one apparently went to the wrong office. One federal judge ruled in his favor, but another said he had to keep trying in state court. Finally, in 2013, Texas? Court of Criminal Appeals ruled that Mr. Hartfield?s conviction and life sentence were void, but his motions were also void. The motions were filed under a law applying to people who have been convicted, the court said, and there was no valid conviction on record in his case. He refiled under a different provision, and prosecutors finally sought a new trial. Mr. Hartfield?s lawyers said the charges should be dismissed because he was denied a speedy trial. Prosecutors argued that while the government was negligent, the defendant was partly to blame for the delays. For more than two decades, they said, he acquiesced in his imprisonment without trial, as a ploy to avoid the death penalty and to make it harder to mount a case against him. (The Supreme Court ruled in 2002 that intellectually disabled people cannot be executed.) The District Attorney?s Office was able to locate just one of the 16 evidence exhibits used at the original trial, several witnesses had died, and at least one had dementia. The murder weapon was lost, along with blood and semen samples that could have yielded DNA. Ms. Lowe?s car no longer existed. But the trial court ruled that the case could proceed, and in 2015, 38 years after his first trial, Mr. Hartfield was convicted again and sentenced to life in prison. If that sentence were counted from the start of his time in prison, he would have been eligible for parole long ago. If he is released based on Thursday?s ruling, he would probably live with one of his two sisters, Mr. Dow said. ?I?m not sure if he knows about this ruling yet,? Mr. Dow said. ?I think it?s unlikely he really understands it very well. ?"
17558,Scott Shane,12/01/2017,2017,1,business,"How did American intelligence officials come to brief President Obama,   Donald J. Trump and lawmakers about supposed Russian plans to blackmail Mr. Trump? There are far more questions than answers. But here is a look at the story so far. ? In September 2015, a Washington political research firm, Fusion GPS, paid by a wealthy Republican donor who did not like Mr. Trump, began to compile ?opposition research? on him  ?   standard practice in politics. ? Last June, after evidence of Russian hacking of Democratic targets surfaced, Fusion GPS hired a retired British intelligence officer, Christopher Steele, to investigate Mr. Trump?s ties to Russia. ? After it became clear that Mr. Trump would be the Republican nominee, Democratic clients who supported Hillary Clinton began to pay Fusion GPS for this same opposition research. ? Mr. Steele, who had long experience in Russia and a network of connections there, compiled dozens of reports detailing what he heard from his contacts. The memos he wrote, mostly one to three pages long, are dated from June to December. ? The memos contain unsubstantiated claims that Russian officials tried to obtain influence over Mr. Trump by preparing to blackmail him with sex tapes and bribe him with business deals. They also claim that the Trump campaign met with Russian operatives to discuss the Russians? hacking and leaking of emails and documents from the Democratic National Committee and from Mrs. Clinton?s campaign chairman, John D. Podesta. ? Fusion GPS and Mr. Steele shared the memos first with their clients, and later with the F. B. I. and multiple journalists at The New York Times and elsewhere. The memos, totaling about 35 pages, also reached a number of members of Congress. ? Last week, when the F. B. I. C. I. A. and National Security Agency gave a classified report on the Russian hacking, leaking and efforts to influence the presidential election to Mr. Obama, Mr. Trump and congressional leaders, they attached a   summary of the unverified allegations in the memos. ? Whether any of the claims in the memos are true. American intelligence agencies have not confirmed them, and Mr. Trump has said they are a complete fabrication. In addition, one specific allegation  ?   that Mr. Trump?s lawyer Michael Cohen met with a Russian official in Prague in August or September  ?   has been denied by both Mr. Cohen, who says he has never been to Prague, and the Russian, Oleg Solodukhin. ? Who concocted the information in the memos, if it is entirely false or partly so, and with what purpose. If all the information in the dossier is false, it is a very sophisticated fabrication. ? What exactly prompted American intelligence officials to pass on a summary of the unvetted claims to Mr. Obama, Mr. Trump and Congress. Officials have said they felt the   should be aware of the memos, which had circulated widely in Washington. But putting the summary in a report that went to multiple people in Congress and the executive branch made it very likely that it would be leaked. The F. B. I. has been investigating the claims in the memos, and Democrats are demanding a thorough inquiry into the reports that Trump representatives met with Russian officials during the campaign. But as of Jan. 20, Mr. Trump will be in charge of the bureau and the other intelligence agencies, and he may not approve such an investigation. Because the 35 pages of memos prepared as opposition research on Mr. Trump contain detailed claims that neither the intelligence agencies nor The Times has been able to verify, Times editors decided to briefly summarize the claims and not publish the document. The Times did report before the election that the F. B. I. was investigating claims about Mr. Trump?s ties to Russia  ?   an article that resulted from an extensive reporting effort. The Democratic National Committee and Podesta emails were public, their authenticity was not in doubt, and they contained newsworthy information. That is a question the director, James B. Comey, may eventually have to answer. His two public statements about the bureau?s investigation of the Clinton emails broke with long F. B. I. tradition. Many reporters from multiple news organizations tried to verify the claims in the memos but were unsuccessful. CNN broke the news that a summary of the memos had been attached to the classified report by the F. B. I. C. I. A. and National Security Agency on the Russian hacking and leaking, and that it had been given to Mr. Obama, Mr. Trump and congressional leaders last week. That level of official attention prompted news organizations to decide to inform the public about the memos."
17541,Margalit Fox,11/01/2017,2017,1,law,"From a single gust of wind, Clare Hollingworth reaped the journalistic scoop of the century. Ms. Hollingworth, the undisputed doyenne of war correspondents, who died on Tuesday in Hong Kong at 105, was less than a week into her first job, as a reporter for the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph, on that windy day in 1939. Driving alone on the road from Gleiwitz, then in Germany, to Katowice, in Poland  ?   a distance of less than 20 miles  ?   she watched as the wind lifted a piece of the tarpaulin that had been erected on the German side to screen the valley below from view. Through the opening, Ms. Hollingworth saw, she later wrote, ?large numbers of troops, literally hundreds of tanks, armored cars and field guns? concealed in the valley. She knew then that Germany was poised for a major military incursion. Hastening back across the border to the Polish side, she telephoned her editor with the news, a world exclusive. The date was Aug. 28, 1939, and her article, published the next day, would become, as the British paper The Guardian wrote in 2015, ?probably the greatest scoop of modern times. ? On Sept. 1, Hitler?s forces invaded Poland, marking the start of World War II. For the next four decades, Ms. Hollingworth (who over the years contributed articles to The Telegraph, The Guardian, The International Herald Tribune and The Wall Street Journal) covered World War II from Eastern Europe, the Balkans and North Africa the Greek and Algerian civil wars hostilities between Arabs and Jews in the waning days of the British mandate in Palestine and the Vietnam War, among other conflicts. Often under fire, occasionally arrested and possessed of such a keen nose for covert information that from time to time she was accused of being a spy  ?   both by local governments and by the British  ?   Ms. Hollingworth was friend, or foe, to seemingly everyone in a position of power in the world at midcentury. She obtained the first interview with Mohammed Reza Pahlavi after he became the shah of Iran in 1941, and what was very likely among the last, after he was deposed by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in 1979. In 1965, wanting to cover hostilities between India and Pakistan but discovering that reporters were barred from the front, she simply secured permission from an old acquaintance, Indira Gandhi, who was then India?s minister of information and broadcasting. Ms. Hollingworth was also one of the first Western journalists to report regularly from China, opening The Telegraph?s Beijing bureau in 1973. Her other major scoops included a 1963 article for The Guardian in which she cautiously identified the British intelligence agent Kim Philby as the   ?third man? in the ring of Soviet spies then known to include the Englishmen Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess. Another was a 1968 article for The Telegraph in which she reported the United States? incipient plans for peace talks with Vietnam. (The talks opened in Paris later that year and were concluded in 1973.) Ms. Hollingworth was never so happy, she often said, as when she was roaming the world equipped with little more than a toothbrush, a typewriter and, if need be, a revolver. Embedded long before the term was applied to journalists, she slept in trucks and in trenches, at times buried up to her neck in sand for warmth on cold desert nights. She once held off an armed Algerian policeman by threatening to hit him about the head with a shoe. Had her eyesight not begun to fail some 20 years ago, it was a life, Ms. Hollingworth made clear, that she would gladly have continued to the end of her days. ?I must admit that I enjoy being in a war,? she told The Telegraph in 2011, on the eve of her 100th birthday. In 1989, though nearly 80 and nominally retired, Ms. Hollingworth, attired in a safari suit, her working uniform of choice for 60 years, was spotted in Tiananmen Square shinnying up a lamppost for a bird?  view of the government?s violent crackdown against civilian protesters. She periodically slept on the floor of her home in Hong Kong well into her 90s, just to keep from going soft. Through all her travels, with all their attendant rigors, there was only one thing, Ms. Hollingworth said, that she truly could not abide. ?I do not mind not washing for a week or more,? she wrote, ?but I do hate getting fleas in my hair. ? Her Graham Greene existence, with its typewriter, revolver and most particularly its fleas, was a far cry from the life her conventional,   British parents had envisioned for her  ?   one of quiet propriety, dutiful wifehood, charity balls and hunting. Clare Hollingworth was born on Oct. 10, 1911, in Knighton in central England, outside Leicester. As a child, she enjoyed touring the historic battlefields of England and France with her father, who ran the family?s boot and shoe factory. At her parents? insistence, the young Ms. Hollingworth attended domestic science college in Leicester, an experience that did nothing to make the prospect of hearth and home attractive. (?Although it is useful to be able to make an omelet,? she later wrote, ?my domestic science training caused me to hate having anything to do with housework. ?) Partly in deference to her upbringing, she became engaged ?to a suitable young man,? though she soon broke off the engagement and further scandalized her parents by announcing her intention to become a journalist. ?My mother thought journalism frightfully low, like a trade,? Ms. Hollingworth said in the 2011 interview with The Telegraph. ?She didn?t believe anything journalists wrote and thought they were only fit for the tradesmen?s entrance. ? In the 1930s, Ms. Hollingworth attended the School of Slavonic and East European Studies in London and afterward studied at the University of Zagreb, then in Yugoslavia. Working for the League of Nations Union, a peace and social justice group established in Britain in 1918, she was dispatched to Warsaw. There, in early 1939, she aided thousands of refugees from the Sudetenland  ?   the region of Czechoslovakia that had been annexed by the Nazis in October 1938  ?   arranging travel documents that would let them cross into Poland. She wrote about their plight for small publications in Britain. The Telegraph learned of Ms. Hollingworth?s work in Poland, and on Aug. 25, 1939, while she was visiting London, it hired her as a correspondent. Assigned to cover the prelude to war in the region, she flew to Warsaw the next day. From Warsaw she traveled to Katowice, commandeering an official car from the British consul general there. It was in that car, Union Jack boldly flying, that she drove over the border, past astonished Nazi guards and into Germany on Aug. 28. Ms. Hollingworth?s scoop comprised two parts. The first was her story of Aug. 29, about the advent of war. The second was her report on the start of the war itself. Awakened by explosions at dawn on Sept. 1, Ms. Hollingworth, from her quarters in Katowice, saw German bombers overhead and the flash of artillery fire in the distance. She telephoned a friend at the British Embassy in Warsaw. ?The war has begun!? she cried. ?Are you sure, old girl?? he said. Her published article notwithstanding, Ms. Hollingworth later wrote, British officialdom persisted in thinking that war remained weeks away. She held the receiver out the window as German tanks roared outside. The embassy was persuaded and soon, too, was her editor. Ms. Hollingworth?s article on the start of hostilities appeared in The Telegraph the next day. Her work from this period is unbylined  ?   few reporters were accorded bylines then  ?   a state of affairs she pronounced as being for the best: It simultaneously spared her parents familial anxiety and social indignity. What followed was more than 40 years of chasing danger, for it was in the most dangerous places, Ms. Hollingworth often said, that the best stories lay. Traveling with British troops in North Africa, she was buried in the sands for the night when she awoke to the sounds of a German reconnaissance party. ?A sneeze would have brought death to us all,? she later wrote. She held her breath in the darkness, and the party passed unseeing. In Vietnam, a sniper?s bullet narrowly missed her head. Ms. Hollingworth?s first husband, Vandeleur Robinson, whom she married in 1936, divorced her for desertion 15 years later. (?When I?m on a story, I?m on a story  ?   to hell with husband, family, anyone else,? she told The Guardian in 2004.) Her second husband, Geoffrey Hoare, a journalist whom she married in the early 1950s, died in 1965. Her death was confirmed by Patrick Garrett, her grandnephew and her biographer. Her survivors include a stepdaughter, Hilary Sandre. Over time, some members of the British press grew alienated by what they saw as Ms. Hollingworth?s imperious manner. ?Ms. Hollingworth?s snobberies are very tiring, her cozy relations with British embassies irritating,? the English journalist Robert Fisk wrote, reviewing her 1990 memoir, ?Front Line. ? But she remained a widely admired, even venerated, figure, a recipient of the Order of the British Empire in 1982 and a perennial fixture at the Foreign Correspondents? Club in Hong Kong, where she had made her home since the early 1980s. Her other books include ?The Three Weeks? War in Poland? (1940) ?There?s a German Just Behind Me? (1942) ?The Arabs and the West? (1952) and ?Mao and the Men Against Him? (1985). As Ms. Hollingworth made clear in later interviews, though there was no dearth of wars to accompany her old age, she did not truly expect to be called upon to cover them. Yet to the end of her life she slept with her passport and a pair of shoes within easy reach, just in case."
18018,Nelson D. Schwartz,28/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"President Trump?s target for economic growth just got a little more distant. The government reported Friday that the economy grew by only 1. 6 percent last year, shy of what experts had estimated and well below the 4 percent rate that Mr. Trump has vowed to deliver  ?   a pledge now cited on the White House website. There are plenty of signs of life in the economy. Consumer spending is healthy, and an index of consumer sentiment just hit a   high. Stocks have been surging, and the jobless rate is near what the Federal Reserve considers full employment. But however solid, the recovery under President Barack Obama never reached exuberance. It is the second longest recovery in American history but the first in the postwar era in which growth for a full year did not hit 3 percent. Mr. Trump made that data point a focus of his campaign, citing factories that closed during the recession but never reopened and workers who gave up looking for jobs and dropped out of the labor force. And economists, even if they disagree with his policy prescriptions, acknowledge that many areas have been left behind. While Friday?s report will provide more support for Mr. Trump?s argument, the lackluster pace of economic growth may also complicate the new administration?s plans. Indeed, some of the headwinds in 2016  ?   like a widening trade deficit and cautious spending by businesses  ?   could persist into 2017 and beyond. In particular, lower exports and higher imports also hurt growth in the fourth quarter, which fell to an annual rate of 1. 9 percent from 3. 5 percent in the prior quarter, the Commerce Department said Friday. In 2016, personal consumption  ?   which accounts for a majority of economic activity  ?   slowed from 2014 and 2015. In addition, the sharp plunge in oil prices over the same period prompted steep cuts in energy production and exploration, contributing to a drop in business investment. All of this underscores why analysts say that Mr. Trump?s growth rate target of 4 percent is audacious at best and fanciful at worst, especially given broader factors like an aging population and the growth rate of 2 percent or so that has prevailed since the recovery began in 2009. ?It would defy gravity,? Diane Swonk, a veteran independent economist in Chicago, said. Four percent growth would require big gains in the size of the work force and productivity, but neither is in the offing, Ms. Swonk said, adding, ?It?s simple math. ? At the same time, the Federal Reserve has signaled that it is ready to raise interest rates a few times this year, and a faster expansion would only accelerate the Fed?s plan to tighten monetary policy to head off inflation. Whatever the growth trajectory is in 2017, Fed officials will have a tricky time navigating the political and economic currents under Mr. Trump. Not only did he criticize the Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, during the campaign, but his assessment of the current economy is more downbeat than the Fed?s. One week into the Trump administration, there are many other economic wild cards for policy makers and private forecasters to contemplate, including the impact of congressional efforts to reshape the corporate tax code, trade tensions with Mexico and China, and the proposed repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act. Tax cuts could open the way for new spending and investment. But more expensive imports from Mexico could be painful for many consumers, for example, while a trade war with China would hurt American companies like Apple, General Electric and Caterpillar. What is more, although the Commerce Department report focused on the last three full months of Mr. Obama?s second term, anemic economic activity could add to the revenue shortfall the federal government will most likely face from the personal and corporate tax cuts Mr. Trump has discussed. ?It?s difficult to see how we would get to 4 percent growth given the current structure of the economy, especially demographics and productivity growth,? said Gus Faucher, deputy chief economist at PNC Financial Services in Pittsburgh. ?That would be true no matter who is the president. ? The retirement of the baby boomers will limit the size of the labor force, he said, while productivity gains from technology are not expected to accelerate from the current level, as they did with the adoption of the internet or mobile phones in the 1990s. Weak growth does strengthen arguments for a federal program to fortify the nation?s infrastructure  ?   an approach Mr. Trump has advocated that could provide an economic stimulus. Since Mr. Trump?s victory in November, many economists have been raising their projected growth rates for the latter half of 2017 and for 2018. That is not necessarily because they feel Mr. Trump?s policies will prove beneficial in the long run. Instead, it is because the tax cuts and infrastructure investments he has called for could bolster the economy in the short term. Mr. Faucher lifted his growth forecast to 2. 4 percent in 2017 and 2. 7 percent in 2018. Previously, he expected output to expand by 2. 25 percent in each year. ?Tax cuts and infrastructure spending represent a much more expansionary fiscal policy than we?ve had in some time,? he said. But Mr. Faucher cautioned that increasing the federal deficit, which stood at $587 billion in 2016, by hundreds of billions more in the coming years could increase interest rates, which were already moving higher. Rates, including mortgage rates for home buyers, are already up more than half a percentage point since the election, on expectations of more borrowing and faster growth. But in economics, as in life, everything cuts both ways. The rise in interest rates has also strengthened the dollar relative to other currencies. While that has been good news for American tourists, a stronger currency is bad news for American exporters, with imports becoming cheaper while the price of   products abroad rises. The prospect of a stronger dollar also makes it more difficult to achieve another of Mr. Trump?s economic goals: a revival of the American manufacturing sector. Manufacturers are more dependent on foreign sales than many other businesses, but a rising dollar makes their products less competitive overseas. On Friday, the White House announced a manufacturing jobs initiative, naming chief executives like Andrew N. Liveris of Dow Chemical and Elon Musk of Tesla to the as part of the effort, along with labor leaders from the A. F. L. . I. O. The dollar is rising on expectations of faster growth in the United States and because of the jump in domestic interest rates, which make American financial assets like bonds more appealing to global investors than   debt in Europe and Asia. ?Mr. Trump can?t control the dollar, and that will be a big factor this year,? Mr. Faucher said. ?Trade is likely to be a drag on growth. ?"
17303,Brett Cole,3/01/2017,2017,1,science,"SYDNEY, Australia  ?   The annual beach pilgrimage during the height of summer in Melbourne, Australia?s   city, is threatened by an unsettling phenomenon: shores where the tides are tainted with excrement. The Environment Protection Authority in the state of Victoria said on Monday that heavy rains had caused fecal pollution to wash into Port Phillip from rivers, creeks and drains. It advised against swimming at 21 beaches because of poor water quality. ?It?s poo in all its luxurious forms that is causing the problem,? said Anthony Boxshall, the agency?s manager of applied sciences, noting that the waste was coming from people, dogs, horses, cows, birds and other animals. Fecal pollution can cause serious health problems, including gastroenteritis. Mr. Boxshall said much of the waste had been washed down the   Yarra River that runs through Melbourne into Port Phillip, affecting the city?s bayside beaches the most. The agency, which takes regular water samples, rates beaches. A ?good? rating means that the water is suitable for swimming. ?Fair? means that rainfall has affected the water. ?Poor? means people should avoid it. Residents said that the pollution had deterred them from indulging in a favorite summer ritual. ?When the temperature gets above 86 Fahrenheit, Melbournians typically pack the family in the car with food and drink and spend the day at the beach,? said Sam Riley, who lives in the city. ?I was going to take my two young boys to the beach myself over the summer, but now I?m concerned about whether the water is clean. ? Mr. Boxshall said any improvement in the beaches? water quality was uncertain as long as the rain continued. The agency says it usually takes between 24 and 48 hours for the waters to clear after the rain stops."
17775,Ben Sisario,19/01/2017,2017,1,law,"In the latest twist in a legal issue that has galvanized musicians, Paul McCartney filed a federal lawsuit on Wednesday against the music publisher   over ownership of some of the Beatles? most famous songs. Mr. McCartney?s suit is over what is known as copyright termination: the right of authors  ?   or any creators  ?   to reclaim ownership of their works from publishers after a specific length of time has passed. It was part of the 1976 copyright act and in recent years has become a potent force in the music industry as performers and songwriters have used the law to regain control of their work. In Mr. McCartney?s suit, filed in United States District Court in Manhattan, lawyers for the singer detailed the steps they have taken over the last nine years to reclaim Mr. McCartney?s piece of the copyrights in dozens of Beatles songs he wrote with John Lennon, including ?Love Me Do,? ?I Want to Hold Your Hand? and ?All You Need Is Love. ? That process involved filing numerous legal notices, which, the suit says, should be enough to guarantee that   would return the rights to Mr. McCartney, starting in October 2018. But the suit contends that late last year, after the band Duran Duran lost a copyright suit in Britain, executives at   began to suggest to Mr. McCartney?s lawyers that the rule might not apply to his songs. In the Duran Duran case, a judge ruled that the band?s original contract was governed by British law, which barred it from reclaiming rights in the United States. Under United States law, this power cannot be waived by contract. As Mr. McCartney?s suit notes, he and Mr. Lennon signed a series of publishing contracts in Britain beginning in 1962. The suit contends that in a series of remarks and emails to Mr. McCartney?s lawyers,   executives alluded to the Duran Duran case and refused to confirm that he could reclaim his rights. The suit asks for a declarative judgment that Mr. McCartney would not be violating any contract by exercising his termination rights. In a statement,   said that it had ?the highest respect for Sir Paul McCartney? and that it worked closely with Mr. McCartney and the Lennon estate. But the company added, ?We are disappointed that they have filed this lawsuit, which we believe is both unnecessary and premature. ? For many musicians, especially those who had hits decades ago, copyright termination has become a powerful means to reclaim their work and to gain financial leverage with the record companies and music publishers that represent them. When Prince?s classic albums were nearing the point at which he could reclaim them, he struck a lucrative new deal with his label, Warner Bros. to let the company continue to release his music. And in the music industry, there is no more valuable catalog than the songs of the Beatles. Michael Jackson purchased the rights to those songs in 1985, and 10 years later he formed   as a joint venture with Sony. Last year, Sony bought out the share of Mr. Jackson?s estate for $750 million. In a note referring to a standard legal threshold, Mr. McCartney?s lawsuit includes a major understatement. ?The copyright interests at issue in this case,? the suit says, ?are worth well in excess of $75, 000. ?"
17360,,11/01/2017,2017,1,lifestyle,"Canada, our No. 1 pick for this year?s 52 Places to Go list, spans millions of square miles. It also contains multitudes, not just of people and locations, but of memories. We asked five Canadian authors to reflect on places that have lodged in their psyches. My mother always kept a bright yellow hard hat in her car, an unexpected accessory for a petite Hong Kong immigrant in her  . She was the senior purchaser for a British Columbia forestry company that, in lean years, laid off everyone in her department except her. (More?s the pity she dreamed of early retirement.) In the meantime, she shuttled between the province?s pulp and paper mills, doing the job of six people, negotiating contracts for hotels, log loaders, harvesters and more. One year, when I was 25, I finally said yes to her persistent invitations to tag along. She wanted me to meet the men and women who earned their living in the mill towns, and who called her by her English name, Matilda. We set out in her car, exploring the    of Vancouver Island, heading for the northern tip, Port Hardy. This would turn out to be the last trip we took together. I remember the wet October chill eagles descending over corridors of evergreens a seemingly endless highway. At twilight, the world took on the shifting depths of an Emily Carr painting. I had to put up with my mother?s terrible driving, and her devotion to Celine Dion. She had to put up with my moods. I was going through a breakup and had decided that, in order to strengthen my moral fiber, I should camp, alone, for three days in the woods. I instructed my mother to drop me off at my campsite, work for a few days in Port Hardy, and then pick me up again. Port Hardy is a microcosm of Canada: a   town with a complex human and environmental history. The archaeological site of the island?s oldest known human habitation (circa 5850 B. C.) the area is the place of origin for the Kwakiutl peoples. The land of the Kwakiutl, whose name translates to ?smoke of the world,? was taken into ownership  ?   both private and national  ?   by gunpoint, dishonored treaties and restrictive and discriminatory laws. The scramble for artifacts and the theft of Kwakiutl art  ?   work that was celebrated by Claude   as among the most sophisticated in the world  ?   has meant that much of the community?s historical work is housed in museums elsewhere. After 1849, the Kwakiutl population was decimated, but it survives. In 2013, British Columbia was found to have once again breached the Kwakiutl?s 1851 Treaty rights. This is not a history I learned in school. Alone in the woods, I pitched my tent. The dark fell suddenly. I made it five hours before calling my mom, telling her I was afraid, and asking her to come get me. That night, we shared a bed in a small lodging provided by her company. I smelled of the fire I had briefly managed to start. It felt good to lie beside my mother in a place that was complex and old. A little over a year later, my mother died suddenly in a town where she was working, much like this one, on a November night when her heart gave out. It was her   two kind forestry men who, worried about my mother, entered her hotel room in the morning, to find her gone. So peaceful, they told us, as if she were only sleeping. Fourteen years later, I understand better how the smoke of the world is never still. Many of the mills my mother visited have closed, jobs have been lost, and, as of a decade ago, a staggering 75 percent of Vancouver Island?s productive   forest has been logged. It is a place that will tell us much about the balance between jobs and environmental stewardship, about our respect for First Nations treaty rights and our obligations to the land. This is the Canada still to come. Madeleine Thien is the author of ?Do Not Say We Have Nothing. ? Grindstone Island is a   dot of green leaves and Victorian gingerbread structures in the middle of Big Rideau Lake, halfway between Kingston and Ottawa.   in the 19th century to make way for its eponymous grindstone quarry, the island later became the summer home of Charles Kingsmill, the first admiral of the Royal Canadian Navy, and served as a genteel hub for Ottawa society life. Kingsmill?s daughter, Diana, who had a lifelong association with pacifist Quakers, took over Grindstone and turned it into a nonviolent resistance education center, staging legendary   games that recreated the infamous Stanford Prison Experiment as a way to train the ?prisoners? to fight oppression with noncooperation  ?   a practice that ended after a disastrous fake ?invasion? by a local biker gang retained for the purpose. I came to Grindstone as a young teenager in the   attending the annual summer camps run by the nonprofit cooperative the Quakers put together to manage the island. The camps? explicit mission was to train a new generation of activists, another step on the ladder that they had climbed, through trade unionism, farmers? unions, suffragism and feminism, to antiwar activism. Grindstone was full of kids like me:   babies who attended alternative public schools in Toronto, Kingston and Ottawa, who could rhyme the classic protest chant ?   ? with the facility of lifelong practice. Today it sounds hopelessly idealistic. But in the ?80s, Grindstone was a perfect incubator for young activists. With its quiet paths, crisp lake swimming and isolated spots with names like Moonwatcher?s Point, the Grindstone experience was one part lazing around and chatting, one part intense, practical instruction. The Victorian cottages we slept in had once housed the political elites of Ottawa society and their celebrity friends. Now they were ours. I?ve always been an early riser, and it was on Grindstone that I became addicted to sunrises, swimming around the island to catch them on the still lake amid the loon calls, then rushing in a shiver back to my cabin to change for breakfast and morning meeting on the broad, shaded porch of the main lodge. As I graduated out of the summer camps, I became active in the maintenance and management of the island, volunteering in the kitchens and serving on the  ?s board. When the  ?s finances crashed with the   recession, we sold the island to a dentist from Kingston who planned to commute by small pontoon plane. I was devastated. Today, Grindstone is the private home of David Bearman and Jennifer Trant  ?   museum technology pioneers who fell in love with the island the first time they saw it, immediately dissolved their successful consultancy and took up residence there, running small conferences for people interested in museums and the web. Five years ago my family and I were their guests. The island felt haunted by the ghosts of the friends I?d made there and the dreams we?d shared. It has been 25 years since I left Grindstone on its final weekend as a social justice education center, and not a week goes by without my yearning for it with a kind of joy and sorrow that is sunk very deep in my heart. I visit it in my dreams, and in the photo feeds from its current owners when I see them at museum conferences, I demand to know all the minutiae of the island?s upkeep, which trees survived the winter storms and what color they?re painting the porch this year. I live in Burbank, Calif. now, and I take my    daughter on hikes in the nearby mountains. Sometimes, when we sit on a trailside boulder and listen to the winds soughing in the trees, I can almost pretend that I?ve brought her back to Grindstone, the place I had always assumed I would raise my own family.

The Hawker Siddeley HS 748 is a delightful,   turboprop relic of an airplane, with metal everywhere you expect plastic, made to land on gravel or ice. Nestled in a Hawker, I flew north from Whitehorse, Yukon?s capital city, past 300 miles of moonscape  ?   gray craters scarred by the white lines of mining roads that seemed to loop and go nowhere  ?   before Dawson City appeared through a hole in the cloud cover. The subarctic town, nicknamed ?Paris of the North? during the late   Gold Rush, looked like a strange, solitary incursion on the land. I was there to spend three months living in the childhood home of the Canadian writer Pierre Berton, who had donated the house for this purpose. A volunteer picked me up at the   airport. On the drive through town, we passed a truck with an animal carcass in the bed, antlers poking out past a tarp.   black birds pecked at the exposed edges. ?If you leave your moose out, the ravens will get at it,? the volunteer said. The Yukon River divided the town into Dawson proper and West Dawson, a scattered community of   cabins whose inhabitants hauled their own wood, water and propane. I walked down to the river almost every day. It was October, and the black, bottomless water flowed fast toward Alaska. Over the next few weeks, the river changed. First the water took on the faint sheen of an oil slick. Then slivers of ice began to race along the current, catching the light like the heads and bellies of surfacing seals. Then bigger,   chunks of ice formed, audibly colliding and jostling for space until they clustered and   at a bottleneck bend. Finally, one morning in November, I woke to an eerie, noticeable silence. I went down to the river?s beach sheets of ice overlapped where they?d heaved onto the shore, their exposed   resembling massive blocks of turquoise glass. A government employee had drilled into the ice and laid out orange flags indicating where the ice was thick enough to walk safely. I watched a dogsled cross. Because of the snow cover, it wasn?t immediately clear where the ground ended and the river began. As I stepped out, I could hear ice continuing to crack, the sound of trickling water running in open rivulets. Under my feet, I?d been told, ran water deep enough to swallow a truck. This would be a stupid way to die, I thought. Halfway across, I stopped and looked south, toward where the Yukon River met the Klondike River. At this time of year, the sun rose so late and set so early that it circled the horizon in a continuous blaze of orange. Part of the Canadian identity is that we?re a hardy people, thriving in the inhospitable north. It?s one of those myths so ingrained and pervasive that you believe it even if, like me  ?   like most  ?   you have lived your whole life in cities less than 60 miles north of the American border. For just a moment, my breath clouding around me, icicles forming on my chin, I stood in that mythical Canada. I crossed and hiked triumphantly around West Dawson, which had been inaccessible except by helicopter during the  . The temperature dropped below   degrees Celsius. When I returned to the house, hours later, I peeled off my jeans and saw that my thighs, like my cheeks and nose, were a raw, violent red. Out on the river, I had seen two other people crossing. The first glided past on   skis with a baby strapped to his chest. The second was an acquaintance pulling a sled. ?Just picking up my mail!? he called. Kim Fu is the author of the novel ?For Today I Am a Boy? and the poetry collection ?How Festive the Ambulance. ?  Hans Johann was a capitalist pig farmer, a man who owned the pigs and the farm. His wife was Barbara. They were both German Mennonites. After World War II, both had fled with their families from what was once Prussia to Niagara, which is where, on some acres between the lake and the waterfalls, they stayed and became Mama and Papa, then Oma and Opa. My mother, Linda, was the fourth of Oma and Opa?s seven children, born and christened at such a rate that the family could not afford middle names. Mama made up for this by calling me ?Sarah Nicole,? while my father, one of four from the suburbs, has never said anything but ?Sarah. ? At home in London, Ontario, I sided with my dad, thinking two names were less smart than one but when we went to the pig farm, my name was turned by thick German tongues into ?   . ? This older, extrinsic version of me was the one I liked best. Summers belonged to Niagara. Driving to the farm in a station wagon with no empty seats, we knew we were close when the asphalt turned to dirt and had arrived when the dirt turned to gravel. A long lane,   in birches, led to an ancient Mercedes or two and a big John Deere tractor, a nameless cat curled under the exhaust pipe. In the kitchen, we ate Oma?s bread with havarti cheese and   summer grapes, on which a skim of dust belied a   of gold. What did we need money for? Nothing. Ice cream, maybe, if we wanted it in a cone from Avondale Dairy. Turtles swam with us in the pool, the water cold and unchlorinated under scum, colored the dim vegetative green of fairy tales before they?re Americanized. Oma said her ferns would grow better if we urinated in the soil, and we rolled our eyes but did it, one at a time. I sneaked away to the gully, read my aunt?s ahistorical romance novels. My brother shot a dove with a BB gun. Pigs screamed in the barn. It seemed in those summers impossible that the sun could either burn me or fail to wake me up, that I could ever be sick for more than three days or have an allergy. I was no more friends with nature than I was friends with my kin, yet it seemed that nature and I felt the same way: indifferent to the rules, remote no matter how we were tamed. My grandfather is alive, freshly widowed. Though he no longer capitalizes on much or practices animal husbandry, he lives in the bungalow on the farm and makes and sells peach and grape jam. Everyone thinks they know what peach and grape jam taste like, but I maintain that Opa?s jam can make you forget what a fruit is. Sarah Nicole Prickett is a writer in New York and the founder of Adult Magazine.  A few years ago, I got to pick a small village to stay in for a while and write poetry. I chose the Missisquoi Valley, in the Eastern Townships of Quebec, because I liked what the bay?s First Nations name meant: many aquatic birds. Indeed, I saw birds everywhere: in my dreams, above my head, through the windows. I saw the wind, too, moving across the cornfields. The region also brought me back to my love of New England. When choosing the town I was to stay in, I?d randomly pointed at a little village called Mystic. It was an enticing name. I?d also found a sister city in the United States with the same name, which had a museum with a room dedicated to Herman Melville. When I write, I always let myself be led by coincidence. I quickly started inventing connections between Melville and the Qu?b?cois Mystic between me scribbling notes in a rented Cavalier and the trailblazers of real and fictional territory that were the great American writers of the 19th century. I also imagined stories of the devil whirling around in the town?s   barn, and created my own private numerology. I would look for covered bridges on the road, round barns built by utopian Quakers and Victorian houses. I thought about loyalists fleeing north after the Revolutionary War, about Irish Catholics fleeing famine, about all the immigrants who left their mark along the path. I knew that by venturing further, to the shores of the great Lake Memphremagog, I would also think about the Vietnam War deserters who?d found refuge there. I thought about the First Nation Abenakis, how they named the lakes and rivers, and about our ignorance. I began my stay at Pike River, but I understood that this road was one where each stop would lead to another. I walked into the office of tourism in Stanbridge Station, my next stop, and asked a petite historian a thousand questions. She showed me Chemin St.  on the map, which she called the second prettiest road in Quebec. (I never learned where the first was.) I didn?t stay in Mystic. As soon as I caught sight of the old cemetery in Hunter Mills, I became fascinated by the border zone between Quebec and the United States. It represented the state I was in myself: a wandering state of mind, looking for ghosts, mine and others? looking for my words, my promised land, my house built stone by stone throughout my life. And that is how, having been asked to stay in a small village, I found myself gathering the rosary beads of hamlets strung along the border area. I?m still enamored with the scenery I found there: isolated villages in the shadow of the mountains, whose grandeur lorded over long lakes and rivers farms and cornfields a Mercedes up on four blocks amid the junk strewn in front of an abandoned house old   cemeteries that pop up at every turn leafy trees of maple, walnut, beech, oak, birch a few wayside crosses old churches and train stations and checkpoints and in the morning, at the inn by the river, a little black cat sitting on a tree branch listening to the sound of the falls and the purring coffeepot. lise Turcotte, a poet and novelist, is the author of ?The Sound of Living Things? and ?Guyana"""
17534,Mark Landler and Julie Bosman,11/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"CHICAGO  ?   President Obama, delivering a farewell address in the city that launched his political career, declared on Tuesday his continued confidence in the American experiment. But he warned, in the wake of a toxic presidential election, that economic inequity, racism and   threatened to shred the nation?s democratic fabric. ?We weaken those ties when we define some of us as more American than others,? Mr. Obama said, ?when we write off the whole system as inevitably corrupt, and when we sit back and blame the leaders we elect without examining our own role in electing them. ? Speaking to a rapturous crowd that recalled the excitement of his   campaign in 2008, Mr. Obama said he believed even the deepest ideological divides could be bridged. His words were nevertheless etched with frustration  ?   a blunt coda to a remarkable day that laid bare many of the racial crosscurrents in the country. On Capitol Hill, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama presented himself as a moderate in his confirmation hearing for attorney general, while his critics denounced him as a racist. In Charleston, S. C. Dylann S. Roof, the white supremacist who shot nine black churchgoers, was sentenced to death. And here, in the cavernous convention hall where Mr. Obama celebrated his   in 2012, the nation?s first black president  ?   still popular, still optimistic  ?   bade America goodbye 10 days before turning over his office to   Donald J. Trump, who ran what his critics labeled a racist campaign. Mr. Obama pledged again to support his successor. But his speech was a thinly veiled rebuke of several of the positions Mr. Trump staked out during the campaign, from climate change and barring Muslims from entering the country to repealing his landmark health care law. ?If every economic issue is framed as a struggle between a hardworking white middle class and undeserving minorities,? Mr. Obama said, ?then workers of all shades will be left fighting for scraps while the wealthy withdraw further into their private enclave. ? ?If we decline to invest in the children of immigrants, just because they don?t look like us, we diminish the prospects of our own children  ?   because those brown kids will represent a larger share of America?s work force,? he added. In giving a farewell address, Mr. Obama invoked a privilege of presidents going back to George Washington. He staked his claim as the leader who steered the nation through the storms of the Great Recession to a growing economy and job market. He claimed credit for reducing the rate of uninsured Americans to record lows, while keeping a cap on health care costs. In a pointed reference to Republicans determined to repeal the health care bill that was one of the signature accomplishments of his presidency, Mr. Obama said, ?If anyone can put together a plan that is demonstrably better than the improvements we?ve made to our health care system  ?   that covers as many people at less cost  ?   I will publicly support it. ? There were also nostalgic moments, as well. He recalled the 2008 campaign that started him on his improbable journey to the White House. He thanked the army of volunteers and staff members who swept him into the Oval Office, ending with the iconic chant, ?Yes, we can. ? And reflecting on all they had accomplished, he added, ?Yes, we did. ? ?It has been the honor of my life to serve you,? Mr. Obama said. ?I won?t stop in fact, I will be right there with you, as a citizen, for all my remaining days. ? He drew some of the most thunderous applause of the night when he paid tribute to his wife, Michelle  ?   ?my best friend?  ?   and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.  ?   ?a brother. ? As the crowd of 18, 000 clapped and stamped their feet, Mr. Obama dabbed his eyes. Afterward, Mrs. Obama and her elder daughter, Malia, appeared onstage with the president, along with Mr. Biden and his wife, Jill. The Obamas? younger daughter, Sasha, stayed in Washington because she has an exam in school on Wednesday morning, the White House said. But Mr. Obama clearly wanted to use his last major turn on the national stage to send a message. Americans, he said, should not take their democracy for granted. Lamenting the perennially low voter turnout rates, Mr. Obama urged people to become involved. ?If you?re tired of arguing with strangers on the internet,? he said, ?try to talk with one in real life. ? ?America is not a fragile thing,? the president said. ?But the gains of our long journey to freedom are not assured. ? The White House had meticulously planned this event, from the location to the tone and cadence of the speech, which clearly reached for the oratorical heights of his   addresses. The president was still rewriting his remarks on Tuesday afternoon, one of his aides said, after being up very late Monday night scrawling edits on what was then already the fourth draft. Mr. Obama?s chief speechwriter, Cody Keenan, pored over previous farewell addresses for inspiration. George Washington used the occasion to disclose he would not run for a third term and warned Americans to steer clear of foreign entanglements in Europe, while Dwight D. Eisenhower warned of the influence of the ?  complex. ? Mr. Obama?s message recalled his final State of the Union address last year, as well as speeches he gave in Springfield, Ill. at the commencement ceremonies at Howard University and Rutgers University and during the Democratic National Convention. Dozens of alumni from the White House and Mr. Obama?s political operation converged on Chicago to cheer their boss. With parties all over town, the atmosphere felt like a wistful version of 2012, or even more so, of 2008, when Mr. Obama?s election drew a   people to a jubilant victory celebration in nearby Grant Park. There was, however, an undeniable tinge of sadness to Mr. Obama?s    ?   the dread among many in this crowd that his legacy will be undone by Mr. Trump, and the disappointment that, for all his political gifts, he was unable to hand over his office to his chosen successor, Hillary Clinton. ?Beers and tears,? said Ben LaBolt, who served as the national press secretary for Mr. Obama?s   campaign. Many said they had waited hours in the cold to get tickets, like   McGee, an elementary school teacher from the Chicago suburb Country Club Hills. Those hours had a purpose. She wanted to demonstrate to her students that seeing Mr. Obama was worth the wait. ?Better than waiting to shop on Black Friday. Better than waiting in line for gym shoes,? she said. But Ms. McGee was troubled by Mr. Trump?s inauguration, and the damage it could do to Mr. Obama?s legacy. ?There?s so much to say about him,? she said. ?He maintained class, he maintained dignity. Honestly, I don?t want him to leave, but I?m sure it will be a load off his shoulders. ? Alvin Love, a Baptist minister, walked through the crowd holding the hand of his    granddaughter, Bayleigh Love, who wore a red sequined party dress. He and Mr. Obama go back 30 years, when the president was a young community organizer on the South Side. ?It?s mixed emotions for me,? he said. ?I?m sad to see it come to an end, but proud and happy to see the work that he?s done. ? Mr. Love said he believed Mr. Obama?s work could be sustained, even with the advent of a Trump presidency. ?Any time right is done, it will sooner or later stand up again. ?"
18335,Cecilia Kang,6/02/2017,2017,2,lifestyle,"WASHINGTON  ?   In his first days as President Trump?s pick to lead the Federal Communications Commission, Ajit Pai has aggressively moved to roll back consumer protection regulations created during the Obama presidency. Mr. Pai took a first swipe at net neutrality rules designed to ensure equal access to content on the internet. He stopped nine companies from providing discounted   internet service to   individuals. He withdrew an effort to keep prison phone rates down, and he scrapped a proposal to break open the cable box market. In total, as the chairman of the F. C. C. Mr. Pai released about a dozen actions in the last week, many buried in the agency?s website and not publicly announced, stunning consumer advocacy groups and telecom analysts. They said Mr. Pai?s message was clear: The F. C. C. an independent agency, will mirror the Trump administration?s rapid unwinding of government regulations that businesses fought against during the Obama administration. ?With these   tactics, Chairman Pai is showing his true stripes,? said Matt Wood, the policy director at the consumer group Free Press. ?The public wants an F. C. C. that helps people,? he added. ?Instead, it got one that does favors for the powerful corporations that its chairman used to work for. ? Mr. Pai, a former lawyer for Verizon, was elevated by Mr. Trump to the position of chairman after serving as a minority Republican member for the past three years. Known for being a stickler on conservative interpretations of telecommunications law and the limits of the F. C. C. ?s authority, Mr. Pai said he was trying to wipe the slate clean. He noted that his predecessor, Tom Wheeler, had rammed through a series of actions right after the presidential election. Many of those efforts, Mr. Pai argued, went beyond the agency?s legal authority. ?These   actions, which did not enjoy the support of the majority of commissioners at the time they were taken, should not bind us going forward,? Mr. Pai said in a statement released Friday. ?Accordingly, they are being revoked. ? The efforts portend great changes at the federal agency at the center of the convergence of media, telecommunications and the internet. The biggest target will be net neutrality, a rule created in 2015 that prevents internet service providers from blocking or discriminating against internet traffic. The rule, which was created alongside a decision to categorize broadband like a utility, was the tech centerpiece of the Obama administration. On Friday, the F. C. C. took its first steps to pull back those rules, analysts said. Mr. Pai closed an investigation into   practices of the wireless providers   ATT and Verizon.   is the offering of free streaming and other downloads that do not count against limits on the amount of data a consumer can download. If a provider like ATT offers free streaming of its DirecTV programs, does that violate net neutrality rules because it could put competing video services at a disadvantage? Under its previous leadership, the F. C. C. said in a report that it saw some evidence that made it concerned. But Mr. Pai said after closing the investigations into wireless carriers that   was popular among consumers, particularly   households. ?The speed of the ruling and the chairman?s tone are very encouraging for internet service providers,? said Paul Gallant, an analyst at Cowen. ?I think it?s a down payment on net neutrality, with much more to follow. ? Last week, Mr. Pai said he disagreed with the move two years ago to declare broadband a utility. The reclassification of broadband into a service akin to telephones and electricity provided the legal foundation for net neutrality rules. Mr. Pai said he had not decided how he would approach the overhaul of broadband classification and net neutrality rules, but he faces legal hurdles. A federal court upheld the rules last year, and the commission could end up in a lengthy legal battle if he tries to scrap the rules. Mr. Pai will have the help of powerful members of Congress who have promised to attack the classification of broadband as a   service. And he is popular among Republican leaders, including the Senate?s majority leader, Mitch McConnell, who with other members viewed Mr. Pai as a loyal voice of dissent during the Obama years. Mr. Pai, 44, the child of immigrants from India who settled in Kansas, is a fresh face for the Republican Party. Congress could introduce legislation that limits the agency?s ability to regulate broadband providers and enforce net neutrality rules. Also under attack are privacy rules for broadband providers. ?The agency has strayed from its core mission,? said Marsha Blackburn, a Republican representative from Tennessee who oversees a telecommunications and tech subcommittee. She has called for a hearing within two weeks on the F. C. C. agenda under the new administration. Democrats in Congress said they would fight legislation that waters down net neutrality rules. They said Mr. Pai, described as a   student of telecom law, would be a tough adversary, and they face great opposition from Republicans who have promised to prioritize the overturning of net neutrality rules. ?The key here is that it?s already been tested in the courts and the court upheld this,? said Representative Anna G. Eshoo, Democrat of California. ?Ajit Pai is intelligent and genial, but he is not on the side of consumers and the public interest. ? Most troubling to consumer advocates was the secrecy around Mr. Pai?s early actions. That included a decision to rescind the permissions of nine broadband providers to participate in a federal subsidy plan for   consumers. None of the providers currently serve   consumers, but Mr. Pai?s comments could foreshadow a   of the Lifeline   subsidy program. On Monday, the F. C. C. is scheduled to appear before a federal judge to defend its push to curb extraordinarily expensive phone call prices from prison. But it told a judge a few days ago that Mr. Pai disagreed with many aspects of the case. Mignon Clyburn, the sole Democrat of the three sitting members of the F. C. C. warned that the actions would directly harm consumers. ?Rather than working to close the digital divide, this action widens the gap,? Ms. Clyburn said."
18049,Lily Koppel,3/02/2017,2017,2,business,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.  ?   Back in his days as a test pilot at   Air Force Base in Ohio, Gus Grissom had a message for his wife, Betty. ?If I die, have a party,? he said. Betty Grissom never did have that party. But on Friday, as for the past 25 years, there was a solemn observance at the   memorial for her husband and two crewmates who were killed in the Apollo 1 disaster. Mr. Grissom, Roger Chaffee and Ed White died in a flash fire that engulfed their capsule atop a Saturn 1B rocket during a routine training operation on Jan. 27, 1967. Mr. Grissom was 40. Ms. Grissom, 89, was at the memorial again on Friday, wearing a denim jacket with a large Apollo 1 patch in patriotic colors. She joined old friends, family members, and NASA officials and veterans, among them Charlie Duke, who took part in the Apollo 16 moon landing. With the recent deaths of the astronauts John Glenn and Eugene A. Cernan and the sea changes in Washington, the gathering felt like a memorial for an era as well as for three men. At the ceremony, candles were lit for the dead astronauts by members of their families, including Cody Grissom, 22, a pilot, who is completing his last year at his grandfather?s alma mater, Purdue University. Representatives from the Navy, the Air Force and NASA spoke, and a Navy bugler performed taps after the sun went down. ?It is important that Challenger and Columbia are remembered, and that Apollo 1 is remembered,? said the Kennedy Space Center director, Robert D. Cabana. ?And that we take those steps that create an environment where everyone has a voice, that we really work to ensure the success and the safety of the crew as we continue to explore and move beyond our planet. ? Ms. Grissom said this year?s ceremony was probably her last. It coincided with a NASA tribute exhibit about Apollo 1 at the Kennedy Space Center, which she, like many, thought was long overdue. ?I thought this is probably a good time to call it quits with them finally getting a memorial of some kind,? she said. This year?s event drew around 150 people, one of the largest crowds ever for a memorial that few people knew of unless they were related to an astronaut or were a   space fan. ?We need heroes today, and these were heroes,? said one such fan, Robert Pearlman, an American space historian. People from all over the world traveled to the memorial, among them Masato Maruyama, 65, who has come for the past 10 years from Tokyo. He brought a big bottle of sake to share with the family and friends. Mr. Maruyama said Mr. Grissom reminded him of his father, who was in the Japanese Navy. He remembers just where he was when the fire occurred. ?It?s not the distance  ?   it?s in here,? he said, pointing to his heart. ?I?m just one of hundreds of thousands. Apollo counted a lot not just for Americans, but human beings. ? Although the launch platform is crumbling like a concrete Greek ruin, and stenciled with an eerie ?Abandon in Place,? the site was decorated with three     floral wreaths brought by the Grissom family. A bagpiper stood ready and Ms. Grissom sat front and center. She was treated as the event?s grande dame as people lined up to speak with her. ?I want you to know it is such an honor,? said Shirley Brown, whose shop provided the wreaths. ?The first time you walked in my shop and said, ?I?m Betty Grissom,? I thought Queen Elizabeth had walked in. You never went down, you fought all the way. ? ?I never quit,? Ms. Grissom agreed, in the kind of taciturn response her astronaut husband might have offered. Many years after the accident, two space buffs, Bob Castro and Mark Pinchell, started going out to the site of the fire, which is on Air Force property, in their own private tribute. One year, they bumped into each other, and came up with the idea of doing something bigger. ?Just two space geeks who were going to Pad 34 and doing their own separate ceremonies,? said Mark Grissom, 63, who was 13 when his father died. ?They met at the pad and decided to invite the families. ? The Grissoms were the first astronaut family to become involved. Early on, car headlights provided the only illumination. While other astronauts and families have been absent over the years, this year Roger Chaffee?s wife, Martha, and her daughter, Sheryl, attended, along with Ed White?s daughter Bonnie. ?This is the families? memorial,? said Sonny Witt, the 45th Space Wing director of operations for Division 1 at Patrick Air Force Base, who helps provide the access. ?Not the Air Force and not NASA. They are the ones that lost the husbands and brothers and fathers. Mistakes were made, and they paid the price. ? When the three Apollo 1 astronauts were trapped in their burning capsule on Pad 34, a cry for help, believed to be from Mr. Chaffee, a rookie astronaut, came over the communications system: ?Hey, we?re burning up. ? Mr. White tried opening the hatch, but caught within the highly combustible pure oxygen atmosphere, the crew suffocated. ?I don?t want any of this forgotten,? Ms. Grissom said. ?Gus Grissom was a human being. ? Mr. Grissom, often seen as an underdog, was a favorite astronaut of many Americans. He infamously ?screwed the pooch?  ?   as Tom Wolfe put it in ?The Right Stuff?  ?   when the hatch blew on his Mercury capsule, causing it to sink it in the Atlantic upon splashdown. Mr. Grissom was initially blamed, and the sunken capsule cost the astronaut couple a visit to the Kennedy White House. In the end, he was cleared of responsibility. Ms. Grissom, who lives in Houston by herself, and Mr. Grissom were high school sweethearts in Mitchell, Ind. Her life always revolved around him. She worked as a   telephone operator for Indiana Bell, putting her husband through college at Purdue, where he studied mechanical engineering on the G. I. Bill. He was selected as an astronaut after flying an   Sabre on over a hundred combat missions in Korea. Death was always on the horizon for the wives. The program lost seven astronauts on the path to the moon, largely as a result of crashes of the   the supersonic jet trainer airplanes the astronauts flew back and forth from where they lived in Houston and Cape Canaveral. When the news of the Apollo 1 accident came to her, delivered by a NASA doctor when she was at a friend?s home for a weekly poker night, Ms. Grissom told her friend that she had ?already died 100, 000 deaths? living with her husband. Martha Chaffee, the youngest space widow, slept with the flag that hung over her husband?s coffin at Arlington. Pat White killed herself years later, a weekend before she and some of the other wives had a reunion planned, her friends said. The space widows felt rejected after their husbands died, while still living in the closely knit community of astronaut families in the ?space burbs? by the Manned Spacecraft Center (later the Johnson Space Center) in Houston, nicknamed ?Togethersville? because of its exclusivity. In the late ?60s, Ms. Grissom became a black sheep among the astronaut community. She was the first of the widows to sue NASA?s largest contractor, North American Rockwell, over the construction of the capsule, and she inspired Ms. Chaffee and Ms. White to do the same. Ms. Grissom eventually settled for $350, 000. On Friday, as Ms. Grissom was helped off the old launching pad, professional and amateur stargazers pointed out the International Space Station passing in the sky above, along with Venus and a shooting star. Back in the car and about to be driven to a celebratory dinner for friends and family at a hotel in nearby Cocoa Beach, she turned to her son and said, ?The stars are out tonight. ? Earlier, she spoke of how her husband?s sacrifice helped pave the way for the missions to come like the Apollo 11 moonwalk her husband never got to see. Still, she said, ?I?m pretty sure he got to the moon before they did. ? She added: ?Of course he didn?t make it, but in spirit I think he was already there. ?"
18216,"Steve Eder, Sheri Fink and Amy Chozick",3/02/2017,2017,2,politics,"Last summer, former President Bill Clinton pledged that if Hillary Clinton won the presidential election, he would avoid conflicts by stepping aside from many of his duties at the Clinton Foundation, restricting foreign donations to the charity and spinning off certain programs. Now, nearly three months after Mrs. Clinton?s defeat, the foundation is still grappling with its place in the era of President Trump. It faces some daunting challenges: a drop in   during the campaign uncertainty about the scale of the former president?s ambitions and questions about leadership, including how long its president, Donna E. Shalala, will stay, and whether Mrs. Clinton might rejoin the charity. Mr. Clinton, in a letter to be released with the foundation?s annual report this week, went so far as to ask supporters for advice on its future. ?We seek both your input and your ideas,? he wrote, noting that the organization would work to expand its impact. Ms. Shalala, in an interview on Thursday, acknowledged the difficulties. ?Last year was a tough year,? she said, ?because people were beating on us with nonsense,? a reference to bruising political attacks claiming that donors were using the foundation to curry favor with the Clintons. Revenues were down for 2016, Ms. Shalala acknowledged, in part because of voluntary restrictions and the fact that the charity?s major    ?   the former president and his daughter, Chelsea  ?   were campaigning for Mrs. Clinton. Revenues ?dropped during the economic downturn, too,? Ms. Shalala said. Still, both Mr. Clinton and Ms. Shalala, who also cited concerns in keeping talent, expressed optimism. ?At the end of the day,? she said, ?I think this is going to be as it always was: a creative, dynamic foundation that helps to improve the lives of millions. ? As the foundation looks within, many experts said it was right to assess its future, including whether a great enough need still existed for its most prominent asset: the ability to bring the private sector together with charities to help underserved causes. ?It?s certainly a different landscape than it was? when the foundation?s work began, said Carolyn Miles, president and chief executive of Save the Children, one of the foundation?s early partners. ?I would say you have to come back as something slightly different. ? In recent weeks, the foundation has completed a planned shutdown of the Clinton Global Initiative, which hosted a   annual meeting, and laying off most of the initiative?s staff of about 100. Foundation officials confirmed on Thursday that two major programs, including one in Haiti, would transfer out of the foundation. The organization has also considered scaling back other efforts, according to several people familiar with the discussions, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Staff members have prepared options for Bill and Chelsea Clinton to consider, which include some new endeavors, Ms. Shalala said. Meanwhile, foundation officials are striving to project an image of business as usual. The new annual report highlighted the organization?s efforts across the world, including opening a health clinic in Malawi and expanding its role in countering the opioid crisis in the United States. During the holidays, Mr. Clinton reached out to donors offering to match   contributions. Chelsea Clinton and foundation staff members in January packed grapefruits at a community service event in New York with City Harvest. And Ms. Shalala announced a new partnership to enhance the health of children in San Diego County. President Trump?s executive order banning federal assistance for international health groups if they counsel women on or provide abortions has also contributed to fears of a broader decline in funding for global health work. Ms. Shalala said she had discussed how to contend with that possibility in a recent conversation with Bill Gates, whose charity has supported the Clinton Foundation and many other nonprofits. The foundation was formed in 1997 during Mr. Clinton?s presidency and has raised roughly $2 billion since then. Its work has spanned 3, 500 projects and 180 countries including the United States, with projects as varied as earthquake recovery in Haiti and health initiatives in Rwanda. During the presidential campaign, political opponents pounded the foundation, criticizing its dealings with foreign donors and financiers. No evidence emerged of a quid pro quo while Mrs. Clinton served as secretary of state, but the overlapping interests of foreign donors to the foundation and official international affairs dogged her candidacy. The philanthropy was a focus for Mrs. Clinton after her time as secretary of state and before her recent presidential run. In terms of deciding whether to   ?we are not there yet even remotely now,? Nick Merrill, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, said. Ms. Shalala, who served as secretary of health and human services under Mr. Clinton and seemed destined for a White House role if Mrs. Clinton had prevailed, said it was unclear how long she would stay as the foundation?s president. For the moment, hiring appears muted: Most of the job postings on the foundation?s website are for food service and catering jobs at the Clinton Presidential Center in Little Rock, Ark. Many believe the foundation?s future will depend on Mr. Clinton, now 70, always its driving force. ?Does he still have the energy, passion, desire and the good health in order to devote energy to it?? Neal   the chief executive of the global humanitarian organization Mercy Corps, asked during a phone interview from Davos, Switzerland, during the World Economic Forum in January. On Thursday, Ms. Shalala described the former president and Chelsea Clinton, who both serve on the foundation?s board, as engaged, ?main influences? on   with Mr. Clinton still a draw for donors. ?He?s got a lot of friends,? Ms. Shalala said. But others saw obstacles ahead. ?The big issue they are going to face is to what degree can they raise money now that the Clintons seem to be out of national leadership positions,? said Leslie Lenkowsky, a philanthropy expert at Indiana University. ?They have lost a little bit of their luster. ? In 2015, the charity?s revenues were nearly $300 million, down from $338 million in 2014, according to its annual report. It has not yet released figures for 2016, but Ms. Shalala acknowledged that they were lower. Internal goals of raising $20 million in unrestricted funds in 2016 were surpassed, but ?took a lot of effort to get there,? she said. In August, at the official start of the general election campaign, the foundation announced its decision to shutter the Clinton Global Initiative, a yearly gathering that Douglas J. Band, a longtime aide of Mr. Clinton?s, had conceived of as a way to connect wealthy donors and corporations with worthy causes. It held its final meeting in September. By contrast, the Clinton Health Access Initiative, known as CHAI  ?   a separate but affiliated entity  ?   halted a series of moves designed to disengage from the Clintons in the event that Mrs. Clinton won the White House. Regan Lachapelle, a spokeswoman for CHAI, said the group?s work was continuing amid discussions about its future. ?None of it?s resolved,? said Dr. Paul Farmer, a board member of CHAI, which has health programs in 70 countries that include promoting AIDS treatment and strengthening health systems, in a telephone interview from Haiti. ?Knowing what to do in this climate is a tough call. ? Across the worldwide outposts where the Clinton Foundation has a presence, speculation about its future has been rampant. In some foreign countries, CHAI has been accused of using the Clintons? influence to pressure governments into pursuing certain initiatives, or rewarding favored American development partners. ?If they disappear it would be very ironic,? said Dr. Patricia A. McQuilkin, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Speaking from Liberia, she said CHAI?s initiatives in the wake of the Ebola epidemic had sidelined longtime academic partnerships like hers. ?They insinuate themselves into the whole process and try to take it over,? she said. Development experts, including Daniel F. Runde, a former director of the Office of Global Development Alliances at the United States Agency for International Development, generally expressed the belief that the foundation could continue to attract support for its work. ?It?s a damaged brand,? Mr. Runde said, ?but there remains an international demand for them. ? For years, the Clinton Foundation has worked with organizations founded by other former presidents, from Lyndon B. Johnson to George W. Bush. In recent months, Ms. Shalala said, foundation officials have offered advice for former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, on their own foundation, which will focus on national and international community building programs. ?They called and asked some questions,? Ms. Shalala said."
17810,Neil Irwin,19/01/2017,2017,1,entertainment,"Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, made it clear Wednesday that she believes that the American economy is pretty much back on track. And that, in turn, sets the stage for a potential conflict with the incoming Trump administration in the months and years ahead. Congress assigns the Fed two goals: seek maximum employment and maintain stable prices. Ms. Yellen, in a speech in San Francisco, rather explicitly made clear that the nation isn?t far from attaining those goals. ?Now, it?s fair to say, the economy is near maximum employment, and inflation is moving toward our goal,? she said. The unemployment rate, 4. 7 percent, is back near where it was before the 2008 recession. And ?although inflation has been running below our 2 percent objective for quite some time, we have seen it start inching back toward 2 percent last year. ? It is Ms. Yellen?s clearest indication to date that the era of extraordinary efforts by the central bank to get the economy back in shape is nearing its end. The Fed has raised   interest rates in each of the last two Decembers, and it is looking likely that there will be more than one rate increase this year. She said in her speech that she and her colleagues were expecting to increase the federal funds rate ?a few times a year. ? As central bankers are wont to do, Ms. Yellen emphasized that those plans were contingent on the economy?s behaving as the Fed expected. If inflation starts to slip again, or improvements in the job market recede, the Fed will presumably hold off. But she spoke clearly of the risks of moving too slowly toward the   neutral interest rate that neither stimulates nor slows the economy. ?Waiting too long to begin moving toward the neutral rate could risk a nasty surprise down the road,? she said. ?Either too much inflation, financial instability or both. ? But if things go as planned, there is a clear risk that the Fed?s goals could be on a collision course with the Trump administration?s goals. The   and his advisers have often spoken of seeking stronger economic growth than the United States has experienced the last several years, perhaps seeking 3. 5 percent to 4 percent instead of the   percent growth that has been the standard since 2009. A white paper by advisers to Mr. Trump released in the fall assessed the view that this lower growth rate reflected demographics and that it amounted to a ?new normal,? and declared it ?incomplete  ?   and unnecessarily defeatist. ? That view is at odds with both Ms. Yellen?s comments Wednesday and   economic projects that Fed officials have released. For example, the median Fed policy maker viewed the economy?s   rate of G. D. P. growth as only 1. 8 percent a year, very much in the ballpark that Trump advisers would view as unnecessarily defeatist. So here?s one way things could go: The Fed steadily raises rates, to the degree that employment and inflation data cooperate with their forecasts, with faster rate increases the higher growth rises. It?s possible that what people in Mr. Trump?s orbit view as a desirable boom will look to Ms. Yellen and her colleagues as overheating, and prompt equal and opposite interest rate increases. There are a couple of potential twists in this story. The first would involve potential Trump appointments to the Fed the second could involve big moves in the dollar. Ms. Yellen?s term as chairwoman expires in about a year. Mr. Trump could appoint a new leader to the Fed who is more hospitable to his view (though she would have the option of continuing her time as a Fed governor, one of seven policy makers who are appointed to   terms). There are two governor vacancies available now, so Mr. Trump could quickly influence the direction of the Fed with new appointees. But it?s not clear whether any new Trump appointees would steer the bank toward higher interest rates and greater concern about inflation or let a potential Trump boom advance unconstrained. Big fluctuations in the dollar could also shape a potential tension between Trumponomics and Fed policy. Economists believe a key element of a corporate income tax overhaul advanced by House Republicans, known as a border adjustment tax, would have the effect of creating a huge rally in the value of the dollar compared with other major currencies, perhaps 20 percent or more. The Fed has been more focused than ever in the last few years on how its decisions ripple through the global economy. It held off on rate increases in 2015 and early 2016 in significant part because a rally in the dollar seemed to be destabilizing many emerging markets and fueling risks of a global slowdown. A stronger dollar also reduces inflation in the United States, which in turn makes the Fed more inclined toward caution on rate increases. Mr. Trump has sent mixed messages on his views of a border adjustment tax, seeming to slap down the idea in a Wall Street Journal interview published this week. But if it looks as if policies on Capitol Hill are going to push the dollar up significantly. Of course, that too could cut in the other direction. A stronger dollar doesn?t help with Mr. Trump?s goals of reducing the trade deficit, and just this week he has seemed to try to talk the dollar down. Add up a week of new signals from incoming Trump administration officials and now Ms. Yellen?s speech, and it is looking like a distinct possibility that Ms. Yellen could wake up one morning in the year ahead to   tweets directed her way, originating from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue."
18445,"Maggie Haberman, Jonathan Weisman and Eric Lichtblau",11/02/2017,2017,2,politics,"? President Trump, Japan?s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, and their wives will fly to    in Palm Beach, Fla. for dinner and a weekend of golf. ? Treasury   Steven Mnuchin?s confirmation vote, originally slated for a rare Saturday session in the Senate, has been pushed to Monday. Mr. Trump overruled his newly minted secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, and rejected the secretary?s choice for his deputy at the department, two people briefed on the decision said Friday. The deputy?s job was denied for Elliott Abrams, a conservative who had served under President Ronald Reagan and President George W. Bush, deals a blow to Mr. Tillerson in his first week on the job. The rejection of Mr. Abrams leaves Mr. Tillerson without a sherpa to help guide the   government official around the State Department headquarters. Mr. Trump had a productive meeting with Mr. Abrams on Tuesday, according to a White House official and a person close to Mr. Abrams. But after it took place, Mr. Trump learned of Mr. Abrams?s pointed criticisms of the president when he was running for president, the administration official said. Among those criticisms was a column headlined ?When You Can?t Stand Your Candidate,? which appeared in May 2016 in The Weekly Standard. Mr. Trump has been increasingly focused on who was with him or against him during his campaign, according to several people who have spoken with him in recent days. Mr. Tillerson had argued strongly for Mr. Abrams. So had Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump?s    and a senior adviser. Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas who is closely aligned with friends of Mr. Abrams? and some members of the   lobbying group Aipac, had been reaching out to Democratic senators to impress upon them the importance of Mr. Abrams receiving Senate confirmation. Aides to Mr. Trump did not respond to an email seeking comment. The revelation that Michael T. Flynn, President Trump?s national security adviser, apparently discussed sanctions with Russia?s ambassador to the United States in the weeks before the inauguration has given Democrats a new cudgel to revive discussions of Mr. Trump?s ties to Russian President Vladimir V. Putin. And they are swinging it. Representative Eric Swalwell of California, the ranking Democrat on the C. I. A. subcommittee of the House Intelligence Committee, called it ?a crime for someone outside of our government to negotiate with foreign entities on our nation?s behalf. ? Senators Christopher S. Murphy of Connecticut and Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, both Democrats, were similarly scathing in a joint statement. Said Mr. Murphy: With the legal fight over President Trump?s travel ban apparently headed for the Supreme Court, a leading contender for the job of arguing the government?s cases before the highest court has dropped out of consideration. The candidate, Charles J. Cooper, said he was withdrawing as a possible nominee for solicitor general of the United States ?after witnessing the treatment of my friend Jeff Sessions,? who was approved as attorney general Wednesday evening after bruising attacks by Senate Democrats over his civil rights record. Mr. Cooper, a conservative Washington lawyer who argued against gay marriage in an important California case, said that after what Mr. Sessions ?had to endure at the hands of a partisan opposition that will say anything and do anything to advance their political interests, I am unwilling to subject myself, my family, and my friends to such a process. ? His withdrawal appears to leave George T. Conway, a New York lawyer who is married to Kellyanne Conway, a top White House aide, as the leading contender for solicitor general. Mr. Trump said Thursday that he expected to select a new nominee in about a week. Whoever gets confirmed for the job could end up arguing the legality of Mr. Trump?s travel ban before the Supreme Court. No wonder Mr. Trump wants the Mexicans to pay for it. The wall on the southern border  ?   really a set of fences and walls  ?   would take three and a half years to build and would cost $21. 6 billion, according to an internal report by the Department of Homeland Security that was seen by Reuters. That?s well over the $12 billion estimated by Mr. Trump during the campaign, and the upper bound of $15 billion cited by Republican leaders in Congress. At a time when federal deficits are again expected to grow, the amount is not pocket change. As the population ages and draws on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, the Congressional Budget Office is already expecting the government to heap nearly $10 trillion onto the federal debt over the coming decade  ?   and that is with statutory caps on domestic and military spending. Mr. Trump has already vowed to bust through those caps on the military side of the ledger, something that would take an act of Congress. Now he?ll have to pay extra for his promised wall  ?   either out of existing domestic programs or above the nondefense caps. Mr. Trump is still pretty miffed that a   panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously upheld a restraining order against his travel ban from seven   countries. We can also deduce what he was watching on television: MSNBC?s Morning Joe. Wonder why it took 12 minutes to compose that post on Twitter. On Thursday night, The New York Times published a scoop: the president of the United States had not spoken to the president of China, Xi Jinping, who was icing him out over his unorthodox call with the leader of Taiwan during his transition to power, and his suggestion that just maybe, Washington would no longer follow the ?One China? policy (which affirms that Taiwan is a province of the mainland). Hours later, the White House issued a statement that, hey, not only had Mr. Trump just spoken to Mr. Xi, he had also expressed support for the One China policy after all  ?   something Mr. Trump had said he would do only in return for concessions. The Times story was rewritten accordingly, capturing the news. But Mr. Trump does not accept the chronology  ?   at least not publicly. Hillary Clinton has been slow to emerge after her November defeat. But there she was on social media Thursday night, praising the unanimous decision by a   panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to uphold a nationwide restraining order against Mr. Trump?s travel ban for seven   countries. To which Kellyanne Conway, the Trump     House adviser, had a reply. Winning is everything. First came the video of Representative Mike Coffman of Colorado sneaking out a back door to avoid the angry crowd gathered for his town hall meeting  ?   but his suburban Denver district is swingy. Then Representative Tom McClintock of California had to flee under guard as constituents in Roseville demanded to know why he was so bent on repealing the Affordable Care Act. But hey, it?s California  ?   even though his turf outside Sacramento isn?t exactly Berkeley. But Utah? On Wednesday, it was Representative Jason Chaffetz?s turn  ?   in the reddest of states, in the Salt Lake City suburb Cottonwood Heights. It?s getting ugly out there."
17973,Nate Cohn,27/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"There isn?t any evidence to support President Trump?s assertion that three to five million illegal votes were cast in the 2016 presidential election. But there is one study that has been interpreted to suggest it is at least possible. It found that between 32, 000 and 2. 8 million noncitizen voters might have fraudulently cast ballots in the 2008 presidential election. The study, based on a survey of 38, 000 people after that election, has been under fire since it was published in 2014. Now even its authors concede that it probably overstated the amount of noncitizen voting. ?The   estimates are likely incorrect,? Jesse Richman, one of the   of the study and a political science professor at Old Dominion University, said in an email exchange on Wednesday. In a post online, he also said that the findings do not support Mr. Trump?s contention that millions cast ballots illegally. Mr. Richman still maintains that some small percentage of noncitizens vote in American elections. But the debate over this study has moved on. It?s no longer about whether millions of illegal votes were cast, but whether there?s any evidence for noncitizen voting at all. The study?s bold claims fell apart because of something called response error: the possibility that people taking a survey don?t answer a question correctly  ?   in this case, a question about being American citizens. There is always a tiny amount of response error in surveys. Respondents might not understand the question. Or they might understand it, but mark the wrong answer by mistake, if the survey is  . An interviewer, if there is one, could accidentally record the wrong answer. Such errors usually aren?t a problem large enough to change the results of a survey. But both the survey and the question posed by researchers were unusual. The survey  ?   the Cooperative Congressional Election Study  ?   was huge, with 38, 000 respondents in 2008. And the group in question  ?   noncitizens  ?   was very small, just 339 of those respondents. The problem is that even a tiny amount of response error among the 38, 000 respondents could have been enough to contaminate the results of the tiny group of noncitizens. Imagine, for instance, that 99. 9 percent of people respond to the survey?s citizenship question correctly. In such a big survey, even that high success rate would still imply that there were 38 respondents who answered incorrectly  ?   enough to make up a big chunk of the tiny pool of 339 noncitizen respondents. If those 38 misreported noncitizens had indeed voted, then suddenly it would look as if 10 percent of noncitizens voted. This critique could explain all of the noncitizen voting observed in the study. Critics of the study  ?   Stephen Ansolabehere, a Harvard political scientist, Samantha Luks, a statistician at YouGov, and Brian  Schaffner, a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst  ?   were able to marshal evidence strongly consistent with that possibility, because of the survey?s unusual design: Thousands of voters are   in subsequent elections. That allowed the study?s critics to check whether people were consistent about their answer on the citizenship answer from year to year. If the people were consistent, they were probably noncitizens. If voters were inconsistent, it would be a sign that the category was contaminated by the tiny number of voters who misreported their citizenship. There was not much consistency. Between 2010 and 2012, 20 voters switched from being citizens to noncitizens (an extremely unlikely transition) and 36 others switched from noncitizens to citizens (a more common transition, but one reported at a far greater rate than typically occurs). These shifting answers strongly bolster the theory that many of the respondents logged as noncitizens had responded in error. But most important, among the 85 respondents who said they were noncitizens in both 2010 and 2012  ?   those most likely to really be noncitizens  ?   none had voted in the 2010 midterm elections. The critics concluded that ?the likely percent of noncitizen voters in recent U. S. elections is 0. ? In a response published in October, Mr. Richman and his colleagues did not contest the finding that measurement error probably exaggerated the number of noncitizen voters. ?The response error issues they focus on may have biased our numbers,? Mr. Richman said in an email to The New York Times on Wednesday. Mr. Richman and his colleagues have not estimated a new range of possible noncitizen voting. Instead, the October response sought only to rebut the notion that there was no noncitizen voting. They argued that measurement error couldn?t explain all of the people who said they were noncitizens and voted. When it came to hard evidence immune to the measurement error critique, Mr. Richman and his   found one validated 2012 voter who had indicated not being a citizen in both the 2010 and 2012 surveys. But the same noncitizen had indicated in the survey that he or she was not registered to vote. The determination that he or she was a voter was based on voter records: The respondents to the survey were matched to a voter registration file. It is possible that this noncitizen was erroneously matched to the voter file. The matching process is good but imperfect, and becomes harder with less information  ?   like the absence of a specific address or date of birth. That the respondent said he or she wasn?t registered certainly raises the possibility that the match was wrong. ?I haven?t seen any evidence that I would say shows that any noncitizens vote,? Mr. Schaffner said. ?That doesn?t mean that the rate is exactly zero. But it does mean that it?s   frequency that we can?t even measure it with traditional methods. ?"
17717,Robert Pear,19/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"WASHINGTON  ?     Donald J. Trump and congressional Republicans appear to have accomplished a feat that President Obama, with all the power at his disposal, could not in the past seven years: They have galvanized outspoken support for the Affordable Care Act. People who benefit from the law are flooding Congress with testimonials. Angry consumers are confronting Republican lawmakers. And Democrats who saw the law as a political liability in recent elections have suddenly found their voice, proudly defending the law now that it is in trouble. Thousands of people across the country held rallies over the weekend to save the health care law, which Republicans moved last week to repeal with a first but crucial legislative step. A widely circulated video showed Representative Mike Coffman, Republican of Colorado, eluding constituents who had wanted to meet with him to express their concerns on Saturday at a community event in Aurora, Colo. Rallies on Sunday to save the health law drew robust crowds around the country. ?We are here today  ?   thousands strong in Boston, and at more rallies all across this country  ?   because we will make our voices heard,? Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, told a crowd outside Faneuil Hall in Boston. ?If Republicans try to rip health care out of the hands of millions of Americans, we will fight them every step of the way. ? And progressive groups are planning a     bus tour to fight the repeal effort, starting Tuesday. With their quick strike on the law in the first days of the new Congress, Republicans had hoped to begin the repeal process before a backlash could develop or opposition could be organized. But congressional Republicans are at risk of losing the message war, especially since they are fighting on two fronts. On one side, the   has repeatedly lobbed disruptive demands at them, such as his insistence that they prepare a replacement health bill almost immediately. To that, he added a new promise over the weekend: that the Republican version would provide ?insurance for everybody. ? On the other front, Democratic lawmakers have taken to quoting grateful constituents to personalize what can be an arcane legislative fight: Bryce in Seattle Randy in Rhinelander, Wis. Nicole in Hockessin, Del. and many more. The focus of public attention appears to be shifting from the   defects of the health care law to the plaintive pleas of people terrified of losing insurance if the law is repealed. ?I want to thank President Obama from the bottom of my heart because I would be dead if it weren?t for him,? Jeff Jeans, a   man from Sedona, Ariz. who described himself as a lifelong Republican, told Speaker Paul D. Ryan on Thursday at a    meeting televised on CNN. Republicans acknowledge their constituents? concerns, but they say supporters of the health law are manufacturing them. Representative Rob Woodall, Republican of Georgia, blamed Democrats for ?amping up anxiety? with ?fear mongering. ? ?The anxiety is real,? Mr. Woodall said, ?but it?s real based on the failures of the president?s health care law. ? Republicans will soon face a new challenge: maintaining anger at ?Obamacare? without Mr. Obama in the White House to stir their passions. Regardless of its provenance, the law?s support has until now received less attention. Appearing on the NBC News program ?Meet the Press? five days after Mr. Obama signed the Affordable Care Act in 2010, Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, predicted that as people learned about the law, ?it?s going to become more and more popular. ? Around 20 million Americans have gained coverage through the Affordable Care Act?s online insurance marketplaces or through its expansion of Medicaid, and enrollment has continued to grow. About 11. 5 million people have signed up for marketplace plans or had their coverage automatically renewed for this year, nearly 300, 000 more than at this time last year, the Obama administration said this month. But the popularity bounce never came. Public opinion remains deeply divided, with the law no more popular today than when it was passed. In December, according to a monthly tracking poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, 46 percent of Americans had unfavorable views of the law, up from 40 percent in April 2010. The share with favorable views slipped to 43 percent, from 46 percent in April 2010. ?In the short term, the A. C. A. has been a political disaster for President Obama and the Democrats,? Dr. Ezekiel J. Emanuel, a health policy adviser in the Obama White House from 2009 to 2011, said in a 2014 book. As Congress took a first step last week toward rolling back Mr. Obama?s signature domestic achievement, Mr. Trump celebrated. ?The ?Unaffordable? Care Act will soon be history!? he said on Twitter. Some Democrats distanced themselves from the Obama administration after HealthCare. gov crashed on its debut in 2013. More recently, with premiums soaring and insurers defecting from the Affordable Care Act marketplace in many states, Democrats were hard put to defend the law, which was passed without any Republican votes. But as Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans race to repeal the law, Democrats are taking a more aggressive stance. Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, told the story of Sonja L. Podjan, a    blueberry farmer in Watervliet, Mich. who was in pain for several years until she got insurance under the Affordable Care Act, which covered the cost of surgery to repair a severe tear in the meniscus of her right knee. In an interview, Ms. Podjan said she ?started freaking out? after the election and sent an email to Ms. Stabenow. She said she was ?flabbergasted? when she heard back from the senator?s office. Ms. Podjan said that the premium for an insurance policy covering her and her husband was about $1, 000 a month, but that they paid just $62 after receiving government subsidies provided under the law. ?I am scared to death we will lose our insurance, and what happens then?? said Ms. Podjan, who reported that she and her husband had medical expenses totaling $41, 000 in the past two years. Senator Tom Udall, Democrat of New Mexico, told the story of a constituent, Kevin Kargacin, whose daughter Amber takes drugs costing more than $60, 000 a year for multiple sclerosis. ?Kevin is scared because the cost of treating Amber?s disease is so high,? Mr. Udall said. In an interview, Mr. Kargacin said he wrote to Mr. Udall because ?we are terrified that without the Affordable Care Act, Amber could be denied insurance or run into lifetime caps on expenditures for her treatment. ? Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, said: ?Many Minnesotans have contacted me in the last few months, frightened about the future of their health care coverage. I heard from a man in Orono. His wife was diagnosed with cancer this year. On top of everything his family is now dealing with, he is terrified that his family will lose coverage if there is a repeal. ? Whether such concerns reflect a change in public opinion is difficult to say. Over the past six years, Republicans have collected stories from hundreds of constituents complaining that their insurance policies were canceled, their premiums have shot up and their deductibles are so high that the insurance is nearly worthless. ?Scott from Hickory has had his health insurance canceled three times now, disrupting his continuity of care,? said Representative Virginia Foxx, Republican of North Carolina. ?Patricia from Kernersville now has a whopping $6, 550 deductible. ? Representative Pat Tiberi, Republican of Ohio, reported that a constituent named Kimberly had difficulty obtaining treatment for a brain tumor because, she said, ?virtually no doctors take the marketplace insurance. ? The differing accounts are not necessarily in contradiction. Some people have benefited from the law while others have seen their coverage disrupted. Republicans said the Obama administration had been slow to recognize and acknowledge problems with the Affordable Care Act. Administration officials said insurance rate increases of 25 percent or more were not a significant problem because   people could get subsidies to help defray the cost  ?   even though millions of people buying insurance on their own do not receive subsidies. The administration insisted that insurance markets were ?stable and vibrant? even as large insurers pulled out of Affordable Care Act exchanges where they were losing hundreds of millions of dollars. In 2015, the administration said that ?claims data show healthier consumers? in the exchanges, but some insurers disputed that assessment, saying they had not seen an influx of healthy people to help cover the costs of sick people."
17611,Michael D. Shear,13/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"WASHINGTON  ?   President Obama surprised Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Thursday by bestowing the Presidential Medal of Freedom on him, calling Mr. Biden ?my brother? in a tearful goodbye in the East Room of the White House. Having called Mr. Biden and his wife, Jill, to the White House for a private farewell, the president instead brought him into a room filled with his friends, family and colleagues to present him with the honor, the nation?s highest. For the first time, Mr. Obama awarded the medal with distinction, an added level of veneration that previous presidents had reserved for recipients like Pope John Paul II and Colin L. Powell, the former secretary of state. ?To know Joe Biden is to know love without pretense, service without   and to live life fully,? Mr. Obama said during the televised ceremony, as Mr. Biden wiped tears from his eyes and dabbed at his nose with a handkerchief. Moments later, as the president called up a military aide to read the proclamation, Mr. Biden appeared to break down, turning his back to the audience to compose himself. After Mr. Obama hung the medal around his neck, the vice president cried openly. ?Ricchetti, you?re fired,? Mr. Biden joked to his chief of staff, Steve Ricchetti. ?I had no inkling. ? Addressing Mr. Obama, who stood to his side, Mr. Biden said that he had never met anyone who had ?the integrity and the decency and the sense of other people?s needs like you do. ? The ceremony was an emotional conclusion to an improbable partnership that began in 2008 when Mr. Obama asked his former presidential rival to be his running mate. The two men became close during eight years in the White House. ?Mr. President, you got right the part about my leaning on Jill,? Mr. Biden said, referring to the president?s remarks about the couple?s love. ?But I?ve also leaned on you and a lot of people in this room. ? It was not always clear that the   pairing would work, either politically or personally. Mr. Obama brought a cool and disciplined approach to politics, while his vice president was the hotheaded, passionate one. Gaffes by Mr. Biden during the early part of the Obama administration annoyed the president and his aides. And the relationship between the two men was strained when Mr. Biden endorsed   marriage in 2012, forcing the president?s hand on the issue. But their bond strengthened through the difficult   campaign and a second term in which they confronted several mass killings. And Mr. Biden?s personal tragedy  ?   the loss of his son Beau to cancer  ?   brought them even closer together. Last year, Mr. Biden seriously considered another run for president. But he concluded that his son?s death had left him emotionally unable to mount an effective campaign. The citation with the medal noted Mr. Biden?s ?charm, candor, unabashed optimism and deep and abiding patriotism,? as well as his ?strength and grace to overcome great personal adversity. ? It called him one of the most ?consequential vice presidents in American history. ? Mr. Obama spoke emotionally about the relationship between his own family and the extended Biden clan, many of whom had gathered for the ceremony. ?My family is so proud to call ourselves honorary Bidens,? he said. Mr. Biden sought to return the compliment. He noted that the Constitution did not grant the vice president any inherent powers  ?   ?for good reason,? he said. But he said that Mr. Obama had made good on a pledge to make sure that Mr. Biden had a job that mattered. ?You have more than kept your commitment to me by saying you wanted me to help govern,? Mr. Biden said, adding that he hoped the history books would record that he was an asterisk in Mr. Obama?s historic presidency. ?I can say I was part of a journey of a remarkable man who did remarkable things for this country,? Mr. Biden said."
18041,Caitlin Dickerson,9/02/2017,2017,2,crime,"Type the word refugees into Facebook and some alarming ?news? will appear about a refugee rape crisis, a refugee   disease epidemic and a   risk of female genital mutilation  ?   none of it true. For the months leading up to the presidential election, and in the days since President Trump took office, ultraconservative websites like Breitbart News and Infowars have published a cycle of   stories with misleading claims about refugees. And it is beginning to influence public perception, experts say. That shift was evident on Friday, as many Americans heralded the news that the Trump administration intended to temporarily curb all refugee resettlement and increase the vetting of Syrians. ?There really is a kind of cultural battle going on,? said Cecillia Wang, the deputy legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union. ?There?s no question that kind of xenophobic or   bias is infecting our political discourse about refugees. ? In speaking to pollsters about refugee resettlement, Americans tend to cite concerns about the country?s national security and economic health as their biggest worries, but they have also begun to point to disease or rape, experts say. ?This is something where the fear outruns the fact by a factor of 100 to 1 or even 1, 000 to 1,? said William Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who has tracked American sentiment about refugee resettlement over years. Mr. Galston said the reaction to misleading coverage of refugees was reminiscent of the wave of measures introduced in state legislatures in recent years to stop the spread of Islamic law, despite scant evidence that it has been promoted anywhere. And while he doubted that alarmist stories about refugees were powerful enough to change people?s minds, he said the coverage played to existing fears and pushed mere differences of opinion into hyperpartisan outrage. ?I think their opinions are being intensified because the intensification of contrary sentiments is increasing polarization,? Mr. Galston said. Outside his job as a police officer in Kansas, Okla. Mike Eason begins and ends his day with the television news  ?   first CBS, then Fox, but never CNN, which he hates. Then, he scrolls through Facebook, where he?s read stories about refugees who commit violent crimes against women. ?It?s one of them Facebook things where you see Muslim men are attacking women, and stuff like that, and having no respect for them at all. I?ve got a real issue with that,? he said. ?I see story after story after story, and I don?t know how true it is. ? Mr. Eason said he was skeptical of stories by unfamiliar websites like American News, but he reads them anyway. He commented on one that was posted to Facebook: The post, which was shared 14, 000 times, linked to a story about a case in which the authorities have not described the immigration status of the suspect, or said that he was a noncitizen. They have also discredited the claim that the man yelled ?Allahu akbar? during the episode. Nevertheless, the comment that Mr. Eason posted on the site, which he later said he could not remember making, garnered 87 likes. ?If Muslims are taught hate by their religion,? he wrote, ?then all Muslims are potential terrorists and should be treated accordingly. TRUMP will stop this kind of stuff. ? Sgt. Timothy Briggeman of the Cass County Sheriff?s Office in North Dakota, which is investigating the case, said such stories and responses often appeared on social media when a person in his jurisdiction with an   name is charged with a crime. ?To be honest,? he said, ?it?s embarrassing and it?s disheartening when anyone with a name of such ends up in the news  ?   the comments that get thrown around. That seems to be the No. 1 remark: ?Send them back and get rid of them,? and, ?We don?t need them. ?? Worries that refugees might be radicalized have also been amplified on the internet. This story was shared at least 1, 400 times: And this one, posted by The Daily Caller, was shared more than 3, 000 times, despite linking to a story with no evidence of a  : The actual number of refugees who have become extremists in the United States has been estimated at between three and 12  ?   out of the more than 800, 000 who have resettled here since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. The online stories about refugees range from outright fake news to those based on a grain of truth and then stretched out of proportion. For example, the Breitbart article about genital mutilation was based on a study that estimated that a   women currently living in the United States have had their genitals mutilated. But most of them were immigrants who had fled here because of such treatment in their home countries. Mr. Eason, the police officer in Oklahoma, said that part of the challenge for him in evaluating stories on the internet is that many are written with headlines that appeal to common sense. He pointed to the vetting of Syrian refugees, for example, which is currently under review as part of Mr. Trump?s executive order. As The New York Times has reported, the process involves dozens of layers of evaluation and can last up to two years. But Mr. Eason has read stories that suggest the conditions in Syria are so bad that it is impossible to verify refugees? stories, which has made him worry that no level of scrutiny will be sufficient. ?They were saying with them coming from these areas, it?s hard to vet them,? Mr. Eason said. ?And it makes sense. ?"
18012,Jack Healy,29/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"MOUNT GILEAD, Ohio  ?   The challenge Annette Cottrell pondered was how to grade President Trump?s stormy first full week on the job. A trade war bubbling up with Mexico. A divisive border wall. A ban on refugees from   countries. Brawls with the news media and national parks. ?I?d give him an ? Ms. Cottrell, 38, said from her salon, Mane Attraction, on Main Street here in the seat of a conservative Ohio county of pastures and maple groves where Mr. Trump won 70 percent of the vote. ?He?s doing what he said he was going to be doing. ? So, about that   week. Mr. Trump drew a torrent of criticism after pressing a series of falsehoods about voter fraud, the size of the crowd at his inauguration and his attacks on the intelligence community. His   executive actions reversing years of policy on immigration, abortion and the environment left his critics seething and fearful and liberal opponents preparing a volley of legal challenges to blunt them. But in more than two dozen interviews this week, voters who helped hand Mr. Trump the presidency  ?     and reluctant supporters alike  ?   were cheering from their living rooms, offices and diners across America as they saw the outlines of a new conservative era in government fast taking shape, even if they were still a little uneasy about the man doing the shaping. Yes, they said, Mr. Trump should tone down his tweets and rein in what they gently called his impulse toward ?exaggeration. ? ?Honestly, he sometimes needs to shut up,? said Joshua Wade, 24, of Ann Arbor, Mich. a state that had not supported a Republican for president since George Bush in 1988. ?Just do what we elected you to do. We won. Drop the inauguration stuff. It?s fine. ? Gun rights top Mr. Wade?s wish list for the new administration. He wants Supreme Court nominees friendly to gun owners and laws that extend   rights across state lines. He said he had been encouraged that Mr. Trump took swift action on some campaign promises during his early days in office. ?There?s no doubt: He?s good at showmanship,? said Mr. Wade, a registered Republican. ?But I think this first week is proving he?s capable of following through on that with real action. ? But what appeals to supporters may be turning off independents. A Quinnipiac University poll released on Thursday gave Mr. Trump only a 36 percent job approval rating and found that majorities of people surveyed said he was neither honest nor levelheaded. Still, Trump voters interviewed said they cared little if the president spouted off on Twitter because he was issuing the kind of executive actions many had long craved  ?   freezing federal grant money for environmental research, banning foreign aid for groups that give abortion counseling and cutting off immigration from several   nations. ?Trump?s done more in five days than Obama did in eight years,? said Doug Cooperrider, 58, who works in construction repairing bridges and roads around central Ohio. The bar at Boondocks, where Mr. Cooperrider dug into a B. L. T. sandwich on a sleety morning, sits about 1, 900 miles from the Arizona deserts where sections of the   border wall may rise. The Hispanic population is tiny in this overwhelmingly white county of 35, 000, and it has grown only 0. 3 percent in the past five years. Still, people here said they felt as if immigration had undercut wages for construction workers in the area. One man said he was uneasy about the longstanding Somali community in Columbus, about an hour?s drive south. Several embraced Mr. Trump?s directives that limited new refugees, ordered up the border wall and cut off federal grant money to cities labeled sanctuaries for immigrants. ?I?m 100 percent behind the wall,? said Ms. Cottrell, the salon owner. ?If he asked me to lay the first brick, I?d sign up. I?m tired of them being here illegally and cutthroating the rest of us. ? She and her husband, Andrew, a Navy veteran, said their views of government had been colored by years spent struggling to get a disability claim approved for him by the Department of Veterans Affairs. They were early and enthusiastic Trump supporters, and when they went on road trips this year, they gauged their candidate?s support by counting up his yard signs and Hillary Clinton?s. Mr. Cottrell, 34, said he supported aid to feed and shelter refugees  ?   but he blanched at welcoming them here. ?It should be about America first,? Mr. Cottrell said. ?We see way too many vets waiting in line, homeless, while we?re helping refugees and immigrants. ? Mr. Cottrell said he had wanted Mr. Trump to gut the   staff of the V. A. and was disappointed when he instead kept on an Obama administration official to oversee the agency. But he said that did not affect his support for Mr. Trump. ?I have never seen someone make promises and immediately start keeping them,? he said. Most of those promises are a long way from fulfilled. The Affordable Care Act remains the law of the land. Efforts to build the Keystone XL pipeline or finish the Dakota Access pipeline could become mired in years of litigation. There is no agreement on how to pay for a $20 billion Mexican border wall. But moves like banning funding for overseas health providers who discuss abortion have a more rapid effect. Laura Alexandria, the director of operations for Grand Rapids Right to Life in Michigan, said she hoped to see the federal government soon remove financing for Planned Parenthood in the United States. ?We have a   president back in the White House, and that is very encouraging,? she said. Ms. Alexandria said she had been in Washington for the inauguration, and she was back there this week for Friday?s March for Life by abortion opponents. She said her organization had organized 12 buses to take people from Michigan to the march. If President Obama was a   ?Rorschach test? for voters in 2008, Mr. Trump?s actions calling for curbing regulations and repealing Obamacare were   sketches. He roughed them out, and his supporters filled in the details. Robert Kersey, 82, the president of an   foundry in Muncie, Ind. said he hoped Mr. Trump would pull back a recent announcement from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration addressing silica dust, which can lead to debilitating and fatal lung diseases. Mr. Kersey said he sees the rule as a burden and does not believe it will make his employees safer. Inside a gift shop in Mount Gilead?s   downtown, Amanda Abdon, 28, said she was eager for a repeal of the health care tax penalty her boyfriend had to pay this year. Eddie Lou Meimer, 70, walking through her family farm south of town, said she wanted the federal government to ease the kind of   regulations that she said had forced her to build a $40, 000 canning room for her   business. ?He?s a    person,? Ms. Meimer said of the president. ?I wish somebody would grab his phone. But it seems to take the press?s mind off what he?s really doing. ?"

President Trump?s aggressive moves on security and immigration drew strong responses both domestically and internationally. Tensions with Mexico are particularly high. Its president, Enrique Pe?a Nieto, above, canceled a meeting with Mr. Trump, and the two feuded  ?   largely over Twitter  ?   as reports emerged that Mr. Trump could consider a 20 percent tax on imports to pay for a border wall. Mexico said its 50 consulates in the United States would work to protect the rights of Mexican immigrants, while America?s   sanctuary cities, including New York, Boston and Los Angeles, vowed to resist   immigration enforcement. _____ 2. Mr. Trump told Republican leaders at a policy retreat in Philadelphia that this Congress would be the busiest ?in decades, maybe ever. ? His adviser Steve Bannon deepened tensions with the news media, saying it had been humiliated by election missteps and should ?keep its mouth shut. ? He added: ?I want you to quote this. The media here is the opposition party. ? This may not come as a surprise: Sales of dystopian novels, most notably George Orwell?s ?1984,? are spiking. Our literary critic offers a reappraisal.

Vice President Mike Pence will speak at the   March for Life on the National Mall on Friday. Organizers have ramped up attendance efforts, not wanting to be embarrassed by a poorer turnout than the women?s marches last weekend. And health clinics across the developing world are bracing for cuts because of Mr. Trump?s revival of a policy prohibiting foreign aid to groups that discuss abortion, a rule that often curtails broader health services. Above, a woman who suffered complications from a botched abortion in the Democratic Republic of Congo. _____ 4. The Doomsday Clock has moved nearer to midnight than it?s been in more than 60 years. Devised by the nonprofit Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, it?s meant to convey ?how close we are to destroying our civilization with dangerous technologies of our own making. ? It debuted in 1947. Two of the group?s scientists cited alarm over Mr. Trump?s positions on nuclear weapons and climate change. _____ 5. In China, hundreds of millions of people are traveling from industrial regions to their hometowns to celebrate the start of Lunar New Year on Saturday. Some cities have restricted the use of fireworks over pollution concerns. _____ 6. For the first time, biologists have succeeded in growing human stem cells in pig embryos. The advance brings scientists closer to developing human organs in animals for later transplant. Since the organ would be made of a patient?s own cells, there would be little risk of immune rejection. _____ 7. Tributes to Mary Tyler Moore, the iconic actress who died on Wednesday at 80, continue to pour in. The TV journalist Jane Pauley, above, said the character of the single,   news producer Mary Richards was a role model and more. She even mimicked her fashion and home d?cor choices.

17526,Mike McPhate,10/01/2017,2017,1,entertainment,"Good morning.  (Want to get California Today by email? Here?s the  .) Let?s turn it over to Thomas Fuller, our San Francisco bureau chief, for today?s introduction. The titans of Silicon Valley like to claim that they?re inventing technology to change the world, and their philanthropic efforts often mirror those big global goals and dreams, with initiatives to end hunger and fight diseases. But the arts in San Francisco haven?t always felt their generosity. Even as total philanthropic spending in the Bay Area has more than doubled over the past decade to around $5 billion, according to the Foundation Center, it?s been difficult for some arts groups to find support with so many organizations competing for attention and funding. Last year, for example, with social inequality such a   issue, one heavyweight charitable organization, the James Irvine Foundation, chose to stop spending on the arts and switch all of its future giving toward addressing poverty. The move has important repercussions: In 2015 the Irvine Foundation gave $15. 45 million to the arts, more than a fifth of the foundation?s total grants. So on Tuesday culture fans were given a reason to cheer when the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation announced a plan to spend $8 million on performing arts projects in the Bay Area over the next five years. A panel of experts convened by the foundation will help select 50 works from artists in the Bay Area. The performances will include dance, theater, music and performance art. ?There?s much more of a demand for arts than we can hope to fulfill,? said Larry Kramer, the president of the foundation, which gets its funding from the fortune made from one of the founders of   the pioneering computer company. ?It?s hard to raise money for the arts,? said Ben Mangan, the executive director of the Center for Social Sector Leadership at the University of California, Berkeley?s Haas School of Business. ?The arts don?t fall neatly into a category of a problem to solve. ? Giving money away is fraught with difficult choices, Mr. Kramer said. ?The thing about philanthropy is that there are a million problems that are worth addressing and you can?t address all of them,? he said.

But now, a richly detailed Google map has been published that includes not just their locations, but also images of the works and the names of the artists behind them. The project is the brainchild of Nathaniel Miller, an interactivity editor at The Sacramento Bee. In an interview, Mr. Miller said he used his free time outside of work to research the murals over much of 2016. He portrayed himself as an art novice who was simply in the mood for a project that he thought would be of use. The murals range from the handiwork of elementary school children to interpretations by established artists. All told, Mr. Miller cataloged 420 murals, but he expects that number to grow. Sacramento officials have been embracing public art as a way to enliven the city. During the Sacramento Mural Festival last August, artists were invited to bring blank walls to life at about a dozen places across the city center. Some of the works stretched several stories high.

17850,Salman Masood and Ismail Khan,21/01/2017,2017,1,crime,"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan  ?   A bombing killed at least 20 people on Saturday during an auction at a vegetable market in a mostly Shiite town in northwestern Pakistan, ending a long lull in militant violence there, officials said. At least 43 people were wounded in the morning bombing in Parachinar, capital of the Kurram tribal region, which borders Afghanistan. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. ?I was in my shop when a deafening blast shook the market,? a Parachinar resident, Hussain Ali Tori, said by telephone. ?I have seen dozens of shattered bodies lying on the ground. Some were dead, and many were crying for help. ? A Taliban spokesman, Muhammad Khurasani, said a suicide bomber had carried out the attack, but a Kurram official, Nasrullah Khan, said the bomb appeared to have been planted in a crate. ?The place is always crowded,? said Mr. Khan, a deputy administrator. Parachinar has been a center of resistance to the Taliban, specifically the Haqqani network, which is one of the movement?s most violent factions, and it has been the site of numerous bombings in the past. But there had been none since December 2015, when another market bombing killed 23 people. On Saturday, local television news channels broadcast images of people crying for help as others moved through scattered crates of tomatoes to help the wounded. A senior health official in Kurram, Dr. Sabir Hussain, said that many of the wounded were in critical condition and that the death toll could rise. The blast was the first terrorist attack of 2017 in Pakistan, which has been racked by Taliban violence in recent years. Militant attacks have decreased significantly since the military began an offensive in North Waziristan, a focal point for Taliban and foreign militants, in 2014. Much of the militant violence last year was concentrated in the southwestern province of Baluchistan."
18126,Jane E. Brody,14/02/2017,2017,2,lifestyle,"Most people say ?I?m sorry? many times a day for a host of trivial affronts  ?   accidentally bumping into someone or failing to hold open a door. These apologies are easy and usually readily accepted, often with a response like, ?No problem. ? But when ?I?m sorry? are the words needed to right truly hurtful words, acts or inaction, they can be the hardest ones to utter. And even when an apology is offered with the best of intentions, it can be seriously undermined by the way in which it is worded. Instead of eradicating the emotional pain the affront caused, a poorly worded apology can result in lasting anger and antagonism, and undermine an important relationship. I admit to a lifetime of challenges when it comes to apologizing, especially when I thought I was right or misunderstood or that the offended party was being overly sensitive. But I recently discovered that the need for an apology is less about me than the person who, for whatever reason, is offended by something I said or did or failed to do, regardless of my intentions. I also learned that a sincere apology can be powerful medicine with surprising value for the giver as well as the recipient. After learning that a neighbor who had assaulted me verbally was furious about an oversight I had not known I committed, I wrote a letter in hopes of defusing the hostility. Without offering any excuses, I apologized for my lapse in etiquette and respect. I said I was not asking for or expecting forgiveness, merely that I hoped we could have a civil, if not friendly, relationship going forward, then delivered the letter with a jar of my homemade jam. Expecting nothing in return, I was greatly relieved when my doorbell rang and the neighbor thanked me warmly for what I had said and done. My relief was palpable. I felt as if I?d not only discarded an enemy but made a new friend, which is indeed how it played out in the days that followed. About a week later I learned that, according to the psychologist and author Harriet Lerner, the wording of my apology was just what the ?doctor? would have ordered. In the very first chapter of her new book, ?Why Won?t You Apologize? ,? Dr. Lerner points out that apologies followed by rationalizations are ?never satisfying? and can even be harmful. ?When ?but? is tagged on to an apology,? she wrote, it?s an excuse that counters the sincerity of the original message. The best apologies are short and don?t include explanations that can undo them. Nor should a request for forgiveness be part of an apology. The offended party may accept a sincere apology but still be unready to forgive the transgression. Forgiveness, should it come, may depend on a demonstration going forward that the offense will not be repeated. ?It?s not our place to tell anyone to forgive or not to forgive,? Dr. Lerner said in an interview. She disputes popular thinking that failing to forgive is bad for one?s health and can lead to a life mired in bitterness and hate. ?There is no one path to healing,? she said. ?There are many roads to letting go of corrosive emotions without forgiving, like therapy, meditation, medication, even swimming. ? Hardest of all, Dr. Lerner said, is to forgive a nonapologetic offender, like my aunt whom I had loved dearly and who served as my second mother after mine died. But when I, raised Jewish, married a Christian, she refused to come to the wedding and never apologized for the intense hurt her absence had caused. Although I made several attempts to restore the relationship, she always managed to deflect them, and to this day, more than half a century later, I cannot forgive her. The focus of an apology should be on what the offender has said or done, not on the person?s reaction to it. Saying ?I?m sorry you feel that way? shifts the focus away from the person who is supposedly apologizing and turns ?I?m sorry? into ?I?m not really sorry at all,? the psychologist wrote. As to why many people find it hard to offer a sincere, unfettered apology, Dr. Lerner pointed out that ?humans are   for defensiveness. It?s very difficult to take direct, unequivocal responsibility for our hurtful actions. It takes a great deal of maturity to put a relationship or another person before our need to be right. ? Offering an apology is an admission of guilt that admittedly leaves people vulnerable. There?s no guarantee as to how it will be received. It is the prerogative of the injured party to reject an apology, even when sincerely offered. The person may feel the offense was so enormous  ?   for example, having been sexually abused by a parent  ?   that it is impossible to accept a mea culpa offered by the abusive parent years later. Righting a perceived wrong can be especially challenging when it involves family members, who may be inclined to cite history  ?   he was abused by his father, or she was raised by a distant mother  ?   as an excuse for hurtful behavior. ?History can be used as an explanation, not an excuse,? the psychologist said. ?It should involve a conversation that allows the hurt party to express anger and pain if an apology, however sincere, is to heal a broken connection. ? As she wrote: ?Nondefensive listening [to the hurt party] is at the heart of offering a sincere apology. ? She urges the listener not to ?interrupt, argue, refute, or correct facts, or bring up your own criticisms and complaints. ? Even when the offended party is largely at fault, she suggests apologizing for one?s own part in the incident, however small it may be. Dr. Lerner views apology as ?central to health, both physical and emotional. ?I?m sorry? are the two most healing words in the English language,? she said. ?The courage to apologize wisely and well is not just a gift to the injured person, who can then feel soothed and released from obsessive recriminations, bitterness and corrosive anger. It?s also a gift to one?s own health, bestowing   integrity and maturity  ?   an ability to take a cleareyed look at how our behavior affects others and to assume responsibility for acting at another person?s expense. ? Beverly Engel, the author of ?The Power of Apology,? relates how her life was changed by a sincere, effective apology from her mother for years of emotional abuse. ?Almost like magic,? she wrote, ?apology has the power to repair harm, mend relationships, soothe wounds and heal broken hearts. An apology actually affects the bodily functions of the person receiving it  ?   blood pressure decreases, heart rate slows and breathing becomes steadier. ?"
17294,John Schwartz,5/01/2017,2017,1,science,"THOMPSONS, Tex.  ?   Can one of the most promising  ?   and troubled  ?   technologies for fighting global warming survive during the administration of Donald J. Trump? The technology, carbon capture, involves pulling carbon dioxide out of smokestacks and industrial processes before the   gas can make its way into the atmosphere. Mr. Trump?s denial of the overwhelming scientific evidence supporting climate change, a view shared by many of his cabinet nominees, might appear to doom any such environmental initiatives. But the new Petra Nova plant about to start running here, about 30 miles southwest of Houston, is a bright spot for the technology?s supporters. It is being completed essentially on time and within its budget, unlike many previous such projects. When it fires up, the plant, which is attached to one of the power company NRG?s hulking   units, will draw 90 percent of the CO2 from the emissions produced by 240 megawatts of generated power. That is a fraction of the roughly 3, 700 megawatts produced at this gargantuan plant, the largest in the Lone Star State. Still, it is enough to capture 1. 6 million tons of carbon dioxide each year  ?   equivalent to the greenhouse gas produced by driving 3. 5 billion miles, or the CO2 from generating electricity for 214, 338 homes. From a tower hundreds of feet above the Petra Nova operation, the carbon capture system looks like a fever dream of an Erector set fanatic, with mazes of pipes and gleaming tanks set off from the main plant?s skyscraping smokestacks and busy coal conveyors. Petra Nova uses the most common technology for carbon capture. The exhaust stream, pushed down a snaking conduit to the Petra Nova equipment, is exposed to a solution of chemicals known as amines, which bond with the carbon dioxide. That solution is pumped to a regenerator, or stripper, which heats the amine and releases the CO2. The gas is drawn off and compressed for further use, and the amine solution is then cycled back through the system to absorb more CO2. Petra Nova, a   joint venture of NRG and JX Nippon Oil and Gas Exploration, will not just grab the CO2, it will use it, pushing compressed CO2 through a new pipeline 81 miles to an oil field. The gas will be injected into wells, a technique known as enhanced oil recovery, that should increase production to 15, 000 barrels a day from about 300 barrels a day. And since NRG owns a quarter of the oil recovery project, what comes out of the ground will help pay for the carbon capture operation. The plant, which has received $190 million from the federal government, can be economically viable if the price of oil is about $50 a barrel, said David Knox, an NRG spokesman. The company expects to declare the plant operational in January, Mr. Knox said. Aware of problems with carbon capture projects around the country and of the risks of hubris, he said: ?We?re not going to declare victory before it?s time. ? If the price of oil stabilizes or rises, and if tax breaks for developing the technology continue and markets for carbon storage develop, he said, utilities might ask, ?why would I not want to put a carbon capture system on my plant?? But developing   carbon capture has been neither straightforward nor easy. So far, problems have bedeviled major projects, often costing far more than projected and taking longer to complete. The federal government has canceled projects like Future Gen, which was granted more than $1 billion by the Obama administration. Carbon capture systems are not just expensive to build they tend to be   and make the plant less efficient over all  ?   a problem known as ?parasitic load. ? The Petra Nova carbon capture process gets its energy from a separate power plant constructed for the purpose, which NRG says makes the system more efficient than it would otherwise be, and frees up all of the capacity of the main power plant to sell all of the electricity it produces. The company estimates that the next plant it builds could cost 20 percent less, thanks to lessons learned this time around. If Petra Nova succeeds, it means a boost for carbon capture. Despite carbon capture?s problems, its supporters, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the International Energy Agency, call the technology, known as carbon capture sequestration, crucial for meeting emissions standards that can prevent the worst effects of climate change. ?If you don?t have C. C. S. the chance of success goes down, and the cost of success goes up,? said Julio Friedmann, an expert at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratories in California and a former Energy Department official. ?If you do have C. C. S. the chance of success goes up and the cost of success goes down. ? Carbon capture is proving itself, said David Mohler, the deputy assistant secretary for clean coal and carbon management at the federal Energy Department. Developing technologies often involves delay and cost overruns initially, he said. ?You cannot engineer all the bugs out from inside a cubicle  ?   you really have to do this stuff in the real world,? he said. Driving down costs, he noted, is what engineers and businesses do through research, development and production. He cited the plummeting cost of initially expensive technologies like solar power. ?We do figure things out as we go,? he said. What the Trump administration will do with carbon capture is, at this point, anyone?s guess. ?The technology only makes sense in a world where you are seeking to avoid putting CO2 into the atmosphere,? said Mark Brownstein, a vice president for the climate and energy program at the Environmental Defense Fund. But some supporters of the technology see reasons for hope. ?I actually think it?s a moment of optimism,? said Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, who met with Mr. Trump last month as a potential agriculture secretary. Ms. Heitkamp   legislation  with another Democrat, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, to expand and extend tax breaks for carbon capture projects. ?What I saw with the   was a laserlike focus on jobs,? she said. ?I think he was intrigued? about the economic opportunity that carbon capture could provide to keep coal power generation in the national mix, she added. One of the pillars of Mr. Trump?s campaign was his intention to revive the fortunes of the coal industry through support of   clean coal. And while the exact meaning of the   phrase is open to interpretation, it generally includes not just technologies that remove soot and   pollutants, but also carbon dioxide. Ms. Heitkamp said that businesses, too, were likely to continue development of carbon capture technology, since they planned their plant investments on a curve of decades and are loath to change course because of a single election. ?The decision they are making is not, what does the political outlook look like today? What?s it look like over the life of this plant?? Although she concedes that a   revival of coal?s fortunes is unlikely, carbon capture could be a way to extend the life of current facilities while keeping the nation?s energy mix diverse. Jeff Erikson, general manager at the Global C. C. S. Institute, which promotes the technology, said he did not expect to see a great number of new coal plants on the way. ?I wouldn?t say carbon capture is going to rescue the coal industry,? he said, but pointed out that there is great potential for applying carbon capture to diverse natural gas plants and to industrial applications. Captured carbon can be used not just for oil production but a widening range of industrial processes, or can even be pumped into the ground. One of the most innovative approaches to carbon capture is being tried 50 miles east of the Petra Nova plant, in La Porte, Tex. where a consortium of companies is trying an entirely new approach to   power generation. In a $140 million, 50 megawatt demonstration project, the company, Net Power, will use superheated carbon dioxide in much the same way that conventional power plants use steam to drive turbines. This system, invented by a British engineer, Rodney Allam, eliminates the inefficiency inherent in heating water into steam and cooling it again. The power plant produces a stream of very pure, pressurized carbon dioxide that is ready for pipelines without much of the additional processing that conventional carbon capture systems require. The creators say that their technology will produce electric power at a price comparable to   power plants, the efficient   plants that burn gas to power one turbine and then use the excess heat from that process to generate additional power with a steam turbine. That means, in effect, that ?the cost of being green is zero,? said Bill Brown, the chief executive of Net Power. ?The potential to capture CO2 at no additional cost would be a game changer,? said Fatima Maria Ahmad, a fellow at the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, a think tank. Net Power combines the resources of Exelon Generation, a power company, the engineering and construction firm CBI, and 8 Rivers Capital, which developed the technology used in the project. The centerpiece of the project is a special turbine built by Toshiba and designed for the punishingly high pressure used in the process. And while any system that so closely resembles a rocket engine has the potential for what engineers delicately refer to as a RUD  ?   ?rapid unplanned disassembly?  ?   those working directly on the project say they have designed safety features that give them confidence. Even if the United States government shows little interest in reducing the nation?s carbon footprint under Mr. Trump and a Republican Congress, consortium officials say they expect to find ready customers from companies in the United States and around the globe, where the threat of climate change is fully acknowledged. ?We see this very much playing into all parts of the world,? said Daniel McCarthy, executive vice president for CBI?s technology operating group. Environmentalists remain divided on the issue of carbon capture, said John Coequyt, global climate policy director for Sierra Club. ?This is the issue where the biggest range of positions exists within the environmental community,? he said. Groups like the Clean Air Task Force favor it strongly. Other factions call clean coal a fig leaf to keep coal, with all of its environmental baggage, in the energy mix. And many suggest the billions of dollars spent on trying to capture carbon would be better directed to the technologies that don?t pollute the atmosphere in the first place. Dr. Friedmann, the former energy official, predicted that the technology would prove its usefulness. ?It?s convenient to just say ?Keep it in the ground,? ? he said, referring to an   slogan. ?What I prefer to say is ?Keep it from the air. ??"
17601,Thomas Kaplan and Robert Pear,19/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"WASHINGTON  ?   Senate Republicans took their first major step toward repealing the Affordable Care Act on Thursday, approving a budget blueprint that would allow them to gut the health care law without the threat of a Democratic filibuster. The vote was 51 to 48. During the roll call, Democrats staged a highly unusual protest on the Senate floor to express their dismay and anger at the prospect that millions of Americans could lose health insurance coverage. One by one, Democrats rose to voice their objections. Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington said that Republicans were ?stealing health care from Americans. ? Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon said he was voting no ?because health care should not just be for the healthy and wealthy. ? The presiding officer, Senator Cory Gardner, Republican of Colorado, repeatedly banged his gavel and said the Democrats were out of order because ?debate is not allowed during a vote. ? The final vote, which ended just before 1:30 a. m. followed a marathon session in which senators took    roll call votes on numerous amendments, an arduous exercise known as a   . The approval of the budget blueprint, coming even before   Donald J. Trump is inaugurated, shows the speed with which Republican leaders are moving to fulfill their promise to repeal President Obama?s signature domestic policy achievement  ?   a goal they believe can now be accomplished after Mr. Trump?s election. The action by the Senate is essentially procedural, setting the stage for a special kind of legislation called a reconciliation bill. Such a bill can be used to repeal significant parts of the health law and, critically, is immune from being filibustered. Congress appears to be at least weeks away from voting on legislation repealing the law. Republicans say the 2016 elections gave them a mandate to roll back the health care law. ?The Obamacare bridge is collapsing, and we?re sending in a rescue team,? said Senator Michael B. Enzi, Republican of Wyoming and the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. ?Then we?ll build new bridges to better health care, and finally, when these new bridges are finished, we?ll close the old bridge. ? Republican leaders say they will work closely with Mr. Trump developing legislation to repeal and replace the health care law, but it is unclear exactly how his team will participate in that effort. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he would offer his own plan to repeal and replace the law ?essentially simultaneously. ? He said he would put forth the plan as soon as his nominee for secretary of health and human services, Representative Tom Price, Republican of Georgia, is confirmed. The Affordable Care Act has become ingrained in the American health care system, and unwinding it will be a formidable challenge for Republicans. More than 20 million people have gained coverage under the law, though premiums have risen sharply in many states and some insurers have fled the law?s health exchanges. The budget blueprint instructs House and Senate committees to come up with repeal legislation by Jan. 27. Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, and four other Republicans had sought to extend that deadline by five weeks, to March 3. But late Wednesday night, Mr. Corker withdrew an amendment that would have changed the date. ?We understand that everyone here understands the importance of doing it right,? he said. He described the Jan. 27 date in the budget blueprint as a placeholder. Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, another Republican who sought to delay the deadline, said: ?This date is not a date that is set in stone. In fact, it is the earliest we could do it. But it could take longer, and we believe that it might. ? The House was planning to take up the budget blueprint once the Senate approved it, though some House Republicans have expressed discomfort with voting on the blueprint this week because of lingering questions over how and when the health care law would be replaced. A vote on the measure in the House could come on Friday. In its lengthy series of votes, the Senate rejected amendments proposed by Democrats that were intended to allow imports of prescription drugs from Canada, protect rural hospitals and ensure continued access to coverage for people with   conditions, among other causes. In the parlance of Capitol Hill, many of the Democrats? proposals were ?messaging amendments,? intended to put Republicans on record as opposing popular provisions of the Affordable Care Act. The budget blueprint is for the guidance of Congress it is not presented to the president for a signature or veto and does not become law. As the Senate plowed through its work on Wednesday, Republicans explained why they were determined to dismantle the health care law, and they tried to assuage concerns about the future of coverage for millions of Americans. ?This is our opportunity to keep our campaign promise,? said Senator Roger Wicker, Republican of Mississippi. ?This is our opportunity to help the   and the vice   keep their campaign promises and show to the American people that elections have consequences. ? Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, said that while working to repeal the health care law, ?we must also talk about what we replace it with, because repealing it without a replacement is an unacceptable solution. ? Republicans do not have an agreement even among themselves on the content of legislation to replace the Affordable Care Act, the timetable for votes on such legislation or its effective date. Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said on Wednesday that she agreed with Mr. Trump that Congress should repeal the health law and adopt a replacement plan at about the same time. ?But I don?t see any possibility of our being able to come up with a comprehensive reform bill that would replace Obamacare by the end of this month,? she said. ?I just don?t see that as being feasible. ? (Ms. Collins also supported pushing back the deadline to come up with repeal legislation.) As Republicans pursue repealing the law, Democrats contend that Republicans are trying to rip insurance away from millions of Americans with no idea of what to do next. The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, called the Republicans? repeal plan ?irresponsible and rushed? and urged them to halt their push to unravel the law. ?Don?t put chaos in place of affordable care,? he said."
17780,Jonah Engel Bromwich,19/01/2017,2017,1,lifestyle,"On Saturday, hundreds of thousands of women are expected to march in Washington after Donald J. Trump is sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. This past Tuesday, the   Fiona Apple gave those preparing to protest a signature chant. The chant is on a new   track called ?Tiny Hands,? which repeats 10 words recorded by Ms. Apple on a phone: ?We don?t want your tiny   near our underpants. ? The track includes a sample of Mr. Trump?s comments from a 2005 leaked ?Access Hollywood? recording with Billy Bush in which he brags of grabbing of women?s body parts whenever he wanted. The track was produced by the composer Michael Whalen, who released the song on SoundCloud, where some commenters did not think that the chant went far enough. ?A reference to male rhetoric?? said one SoundCloud critic, arguing that Ms. Apple should have included more substantive complaints. ?If that?s the worst we can complain about him, then maybe we should have all voted for him. ? Mr. Whalen responded that Ms. Apple?s goal had simply been to create a chant for the march. A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. Online, the song met with a scattering of criticisms from Mr. Trump?s supporters, who pointed out that those who normally denounce bullying were embracing derogatory and demeaning language about the future president. Ms. Apple, who began her music career in the 1990s, has become something of a recluse. A New York Magazine article from 2012 labeled Ms. Apple a ?musical hermit. ? But her albums continue to be critically acclaimed. Her last L. P. released that year, received a high aggregate score, 89, on the website Metacritic, and was her     effort to date. Ms. Apple?s new song is not the first time that Mr. Trump?s comments from the incendiary recording have been repurposed by his opponents. A group of knitters united online to form ?The Pussyhat Project,? dedicated to creating 1. 1 million hats for protesters to wear at the march on Saturday. ?Tiny Hands? is also not the indie singer?s first protest song aimed at Mr. Trump. Last year, Ms. Apple released a Christmas tune on Tumblr that made such ferocious use of a double entendre that its title can?t be published in The New York Times. Ms. Apple has spoken publicly about being sexually assaulted at the age of 12 and has a history of airing her perspective on serious matters in her music. Accepting an MTV award for best new artist in 1997, she railed against the artificiality of the music industry, referred to Maya Angelou as an inspiration and implored her fans to think for themselves. Other artists, however, are celebrating Mr. Trump?s imminent assumption of the presidency. A relatively obscure American poet, Joseph Charles MacKenzie, wrote a poem praising the   and his Scottish heritage. The poem refers to Mr. Trump as ?the Domhnall,? the Scottish form of his first name. It reads in part: When crippling corruption polluted our nation And plunged our economy into stagnation, As   rogues took the opulent office And plump politicians reneged on their promise, The forgotten continued to form a great crowd That defended the Domhnall, the best of MacLeod!"
17871,Tyler Kepner,23/01/2017,2017,1,sports,"When Yordano Ventura won Game 6 of the 2014 World Series for the Kansas City Royals, he wore the initials of Oscar Taveras on his cap. Taveras, an outfielder for the St. Louis Cardinals, had just been killed in a car accident in the Dominican Republic, the homeland they shared. Early Sunday morning, Ventura was killed in a car accident there at 25. Andy Marte, 33, a former infielder who spent parts of seven seasons with Atlanta, Cleveland and Arizona, was killed in another car crash Sunday in the Dominican Republic. Major League Baseball announced the deaths on its social media accounts. The traffic authorities in the Dominican Republic said that it was not clear whether Ventura had been driving when he died on a highway about 40 miles northwest of the capital, Santo Domingo. Marte died when the   he was driving hit a house about 95 miles north of Santo Domingo, the authorities said. Ventura was a     who reached the majors in September 2013 and seemed destined to stay for many years. He had a record of   with a 3. 89 earned run average, and he was part of the team?s core, with a $23 million contract that could have bound him to Kansas City through 2021. ?I love you my brother,? Royals first baseman Eric Hosmer wrote on Instagram, sharing a photograph of himself with Ventura. ?I?m in disbelief and don?t know what to say. I love you ACE. ? Only one qualified starting pitcher, the Mets? Noah Syndergaard, had a harder average fastball last season than Ventura?s Syndergaard?s averaged 97. 9 miles per hour, Ventura?s 96. 1 m. p. h. Ventura made three World Series starts, two in 2014 against the San Francisco Giants, and then a loss to the Mets at Citi Field in 2015. He gained a measure of notoriety last season when he was suspended for eight games for hitting Baltimore?s Manny Machado in the back with a fastball, inciting a brawl. Ventura was   with a 4. 45 E. R. A. in his final season. Marte spent the past two seasons playing professionally in South Korea. Once a promising prospect for the Braves, he was traded to Boston for Edgar Renteria in 2005, and he was then quickly sent to Cleveland in a multiplayer deal that brought Coco Crisp to the Red Sox. Marte played 278 of his 308 career games with the Indians, and batted . 218, with 21 homers and 99 runs batted in, over all. ?He was a genuine person who always greeted you with a warm smile,? the Indians wrote on Twitter. Tony Clark, the executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association, said in a statement: ?It?s never easy to lose a member of our fraternity, and there are no words to describe the feeling of losing two young men in the prime of their lives. Our thoughts and prayers go out to their families, friends, teammates and fans throughout the United States and Latin America. ? The Dominican Republic?s president, Danilo Medina, posted on Twitter that the nation ?is dressed in mourning with the deaths of Andy Marte and Yordano Ventura, great sportsmen who raised high our national banner. ? Fans began arriving at Kansas City?s Kauffman Stadium shortly after Ventura?s death was announced, leaving flowers, hats and other mementos outside. Flags at the ballpark were lowered to  . A 2015 study by the World Health Organization found that the Dominican Republic had the highest traffic accident death rate in the Americas, 29. 3 per 100, 000 inhabitants.

18075,David Zucchino,31/01/2017,2017,1,sports,"New York Times journalists are in the field in central and northern Iraq to assess the humanitarian impact of battles between the government and Islamic State fighters. TIKRIT, Iraq  ?   Udbais Musa says he punched his son and threatened to disown him when the    announced last year that he was leaving home to join the Islamic State. Ultimately, Mr. Musa lost both his son and his house. To punish the son, Iraqi security forces evicted Mr. Musa and his family from their home on Tikrit?s outskirts on Jan. 4. He said they had been transported by military truck to a windswept displaced persons camp with only the clothes they were wearing and a few tattered personal papers. Under a new collective punishment policy by the provincial government here, at least 345 families accused of ties to the Islamic State have been evicted and confined to Al Shahama camp outside Tikrit this month, according to provincial leaders. Officials said about 200 other families had been evicted and held in a school and at a separate camp called Rubaidha. Mr. Musa, 60, now shares a    tent with nine family members whose only crime was to have a relative who had joined the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh. Several women evicted from their homes and trucked to the Shahama camp said Iraqi security forces demolished their houses with explosives after accusing their sons or husbands of joining the terrorist group. The authorities of Salahuddin Province say the punishment against the families of ISIS members is intended to force the group?s recruits to pay a painful personal price. ?Our aim is to defy the terrorists and send a stern message to the families,? Amar Hekmat, the deputy governor, said inside the barricaded provincial government center. But the evictions have set off a rancorous dispute between officials in Tikrit and politicians in Baghdad. Prime Minister Haider   in a letter to the provincial governor last week, sharply criticized the removals and ordered provincial and Baghdad officials to resolve the issue. The tensions raised by the Salahuddin officials? actions cut to the heart of sectarian grievances across the whole country, where tens of thousands of Sunni families have been displaced either by the Islamic State or by government offensives against the group. Even as Mr. Abadi?s national government has tried to address reports of abuses by the   security forces and their militia allies, deep distrust persists in Iraq?s Sunni communities. In an interview, Mishan   a member of Parliament from Salahuddin Province, accused the provincial security commander of human rights violations against ?the innocent and the repressed. ? The Salahuddin operations commander, Brig. Gen. Juma Enad Sadoon, called critics like Mr. Jiboori ?barking dogs and mercenaries? and said they should not interfere in security matters in Tikrit. In an interview, General Sadoon did not indicate whether the removals would be halted. The evictions have evoked unwelcome comparisons to collective punishments, including home demolitions, imposed by Israel against families of Palestinians accused of attacks. Collective punishment is prohibited under the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions and is generally considered illegal under international law. Officials in Tikrit cited extraordinary security concerns for the evictions. ?This is a very difficult situation for us because of the terrible suffering caused by Daesh,? Mr. Hekmat said. ?We are under great pressure to rebuild our city and impose civil order? after almost a year under Islamic State occupation in 2014 and 2015, he said. Khazhal Hamad, the province?s first deputy governor, said the removals protected families from retaliation by neighbors who lost family members to ISIS attacks. ?There are hostile feelings toward these people, and these feelings can affect the civil peace we are trying to achieve,? Mr. Hamad said. The Tikrit evictions are perhaps a prelude to postcombat frictions in the city of Mosul, 140 miles north, if government forces can uproot Islamic State forces there. Tikrit is a potent symbol of Sunni dominion in central Iraq. Saddam Hussein was born in Awja, just outside Tikrit, and his palaces still tower over the landscape here. Yet Shiite Muslim militias, backed by Iran and known as popular mobilization forces, led the charge to evict the Islamic State from the city in April 2015. The main highway into Tikrit is now festooned with posters featuring the faces of Shiite militiamen killed in battle and images of the revered Shiite imams Hussein and Ali. Some of the posters are mounted next to Iraqi government military compounds. But local Sunni militiamen, along with Iraqi security forces, have themselves carried out some of the evictions  ?   all targeting Sunnis. Thousands of Sunni tribal fighters had joined the fight against ISIS in Tikrit. Today, pockets of Islamic State fighters remain in Tikrit districts west of the Tigris River. Security officials said the small militant cells occasionally fired mortars from Sunni neighborhoods where many of the evictions have occurred. Hussein Ahmed Khalaf, director of the Shahama camp, said none of the 345 evicted families  ?   1, 111 people  ?   had been permitted to return home. All will undergo security screenings to determine their fates, he said. Several of those evicted said security forces had confiscated their cellphones and interrogated them about family members? ties to the Islamic State. They said they had not been told when, or whether, they would be allowed to return home. Several acknowledged that fathers or sons had joined ISIS, but they insisted that they supported the Iraqi government. They said their children had been removed from school and compelled to endure a harsh existence in the forlorn Shahama camp. ?What is the guilt of my children? They don?t know anything about Daesh,? said Eman Khalil Hamad, 34. She said she and her seven children had been evicted and their   home demolished to punish her husband, an Islamic State fighter she said she had not seen for months. Ms. Hamad said the family had suffered under the Islamic State?s harsh social codes. But now, she said, she was abused by security forces who slapped and insulted her as she was forced onto a military truck this month. Hussein   55, a Sunni Muslim tribal sheikh and a commander of a Sunni militia force that helped restore Tikrit to government control, said collective punishment was counterproductive. ?It will only turn people away from the government and strengthen Daesh,? said Mr. Gibory, who wore combat fatigues with military insignia of the popular mobilization forces  ?   the collective name for militia forces in Iraq. He said authorities should use ?social rehabilitation? to convince families of Islamic State members that ?Daesh is more dangerous than a nuclear bomb. ? ?We are tribal people,? Mr. Gibory said. ?We should turn to dialogue rather than dragging women and children from their homes. ? Mr. Musa, the father of the ISIS fighter, said he felt betrayed by his government. He said he had alerted the tribal sheikh in his village, on Tikrit?s west side, after his son joined the group, and disavowed both his son and the Islamic State. The sheikh signed and stamped a letter attesting to Mr. Musa?s innocence. But the security forces who evicted him refused to read the document, Mr. Musa said, clutching the worn letter inside his camp tent. Hadia Ibrahim, 44, a mother of 11 children, said two of her sons  ?   one an Iraqi police officer  ?   had been killed by the Islamic State. But she said she and her four daughters were now confined to the Shahama camp after her husband joined ISIS in 2014, she said. When security forces descended on her home three weeks ago, Ms. Ibrahim said, they told her, ?You are the family of Daesh  ?   leave!? Mr. Hamad, the first deputy governor, said evicted families ultimately might be moved to other areas, or even other provinces. ?That is to be determined by security agencies,? he said. Some families with Islamic State relatives have fled Salahuddin Province altogether to avoid evictions, Mr. Hamad said. ?Those people,? he said, ?will never be allowed to come back. ?"
18033,Laird Hunt,6/02/2017,2017,2,lifestyle,"My grandmother, F. Helen Hunt, was tough. I learned this when I was 13, the year I moved alone from London to Clinton County, Ind. to live with her on her   farm. I sailed in amid the wreckage of my parents? marriage. Maybe I should say as part of the wreckage. Upon my arrival, my grandmother took one look at furious, hurt, young me and prescribed hugs  ?   she was never stingy with them  ?   and what felt to me, lately prowling the streets of South Kensington and St. John?s Wood, like outrageous amounts of manual labor. These weren?t chores: She paid me, not unfairly, for what I did. But it wasn?t quite voluntary either. I hauled wood, I mowed her enormous lawn with a little push mower, I cleared fallen branches, I raked, I burned, I strung and tested electric fences, I dug holes, I ran a rototiller, I pulled weeds, I knocked down derelict buildings with a crowbar and sledgehammer, I washed windows, I worked a scythe. One of my early jobs was learning how to drive my late  ?s temperamental 1951 Farmall Cub tractor so that I could tear out a vineyard, relic of a winemaking project started by my aunt and uncle that had by that time, in the early 1980s, run its course. It turned out the Cub had a functioning mowing element, and when I had finished tearing out the rows of Foch grapevines, I regularly used it to shear the grass and weeds of my grandmother?s east and west woods. Even if from time to time I also found myself detasseling corn in hot fields or baling and stacking hay in even hotter barns for neighboring farmers, the core of what I did was always for my grandmother. And I didn?t do it alone. My grandmother stood a smidgen over five feet tall in her Sunday heels, was a retired teacher of Latin who knew all the declensions and had once interviewed Thomas Wolfe?s brother and traveled the world, but man, could she get to it. After school and church duties were done  ?   and there was no monkeying around about either  ?   we went out rain or shine, cold or heat. It didn?t matter if I was walking with a limp or had sore muscles from playing football or basketball the night before. If it wasn?t torn or broken, you worked on it. That first year, on a day when we were shifting old    from one spot to another for no clear  ?   to me  ?   reason in a cold, steady springtime drizzle, I let one I was supposed to be holding steady slip, and it smacked her hard in the mouth. I already stood a foot taller than her and outweighed her by 50 pounds and that blow would have laid me out. But my grandmother just spat, instructed me through her swelling lip to get a tighter grip, and we went back to it, got it done. On those occasions when we worked independently  ?   say my grandmother in her greenhouse and me at the woodpile  ?   she was never loath to raise a steely eyebrow in the face of my highball estimates about how many chunks of wood I had carried. I?m painting a picture of a    taskmaster here  ?   the older   who runs everyone else into the ground  ?   but she also remained generous with those hugs. There were kisses too. My grandmother was, in addition, fond of affectionately grabbing and squeezing my forearm. At the end of a big job, or when I?d done something passable at school or on the field, we would link hands, throw our heads back and spin around together. She would also brag about me to anyone, in any context, within earshot, whether she knew them or not. Much as my teenage self rebelled against the one and sometimes only grudgingly tolerated the other, when I look back on it now, it is clear to me that with these sturdy threads of hard work and fierce affection my grandmother was weaving the torn world back together for me. My grandmother?s admirable grit, which she displayed in just about every aspect of her long life (she variously credited these qualities to having been born breach and not breathing or to having come of age during the Great Depression) not only helped see me through my troubled teens and early adulthood, it has become the subject of my life?s work. Indeed, I recently finished my third novel set in and around rural Indiana, featuring strong women as protagonists. These novels, which take place in the deep well of the past, aren?t studies of my grandmother?s life, but they are absolutely and unapologetically inspired by it. Each character is different, each is admirable and flawed in near equal measure, but they all have in common my grandmother?s   inability to quit in the face of challenge and a thundering capacity for love. When I first went to my grandmother?s, the idea was that I would stay in Indiana for a year. I ended up staying five with her, and nine if you count college in Bloomington, a couple of hours away. In the process, in the company of my outsize, diminutive grandmother, I grew to adulthood. And although she has been gone for years, I keep her close both in my characters and in myself. There is no way to pay off a debt like the one I owe her, but I make regular payments in the only kind of currency she would have accepted: dedication to the task at hand and the ability, when it has been merited, to link hands with those close to me and spin with joy."
17358,Ben Hubbard,5/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"BEIRUT, Lebanon  ?   For millions of Damascus residents,   concerns about the direction of the war in Syria have been replaced by worries about where to get enough water to do the dishes, wash clothes or take a shower. For nearly two weeks, the Syrian capital and its vicinity have been afflicted by a water crisis that has left taps dry, caused long lines at wells and forced people to stretch whatever thin resources they can find. ?When the world gets hard for us, we work something out,? said a woman in a video posted on Facebook showing how she used a   cola bottle to wash teacups. ?When you cut off the water, we dig for water. When you cut off the tap, we make a tap. ? Like most of Syria?s problems, the Damascus water crisis is a symptom of the war, which has killed hundreds of thousands of people, displaced about half the country?s prewar population of 22 million and left its territory divided into zones controlled by the government, armed rebels and jihadist groups. While a   brokered by Russia and Turkey and announced last week has reduced overall violence across the country, it has not stopped the fighting everywhere, nor has it resolved what happens when resources needed by one side are controlled by its enemies, as appears to be the case with Damascus?s water. Historically, most of the water for the capital, which is controlled by the government of President Bashar   has come from the Barada Valley north of the city, which is controlled by rebels who want to oust Mr. Assad. The crisis began on Dec. 22, when the water stopped flowing. Each side has accused the other of damaging infrastructure near the spring, halting the flow. Antigovernment activists have posted photos online, purporting to show structures around the spring that they say were damaged by exploding barrels dropped from government helicopters. The government first accused the rebels of polluting the water, then of damaging the infrastructure. Jens Laerke, a spokesman for the United Nations humanitarian office in Geneva, said by email Tuesday that the ?deliberate targeting of the water infrastructure? had caused the  . ?But we are not in a position to say by whom,? he said. ?The area has been the scene of much fighting, so we have not been able to access it. ? Now, 5. 5 million people in Damascus and the vicinity lack water, which has raised the risk of waterborne disease, especially among children, he said. Fighting near the Barada Valley has continued despite the  . Antigovernment activists say that government forces, and fighters from Lebanon?s Hezbollah organization, have continued to attack the area in an apparent attempt to take it over. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which tracks the conflict from Britain through a network of contacts in Syria, said the government launched 15 airstrikes on the area Monday amid clashes between rebels and   forces. Turkey?s foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, accused the Syrian government and its allies on Wednesday of violating the   saying that the new violence could derail peace talks meant to be held in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan, on Jan. 23. Rebel groups have threatened to boycott the talks if government attacks do not stop. Few Damascus residents expect much from the talks or have time to think about them. While generally safe from the violence that had reduced other parts of the country to rubble, they were struggling through a cold winter of high prices and scarce commodities before the water crisis, making things worse. The Syrian government has sought to ease the crisis by trucking water from wells around the city, and the United Nations has rehabilitated 120 wells to cover about   of the city?s daily needs, Mr. Laerke, the spokesman, said. But many residents said they had received nothing. Some were buying water from men with private tankers, while others took advantage of whatever they could get. A    shopkeeper said he had not had a shower in 10 days but that he and his sons went to the mosque every day to wash their hands, feet and faces, an option not available to the women of the house. At home, he said, they used plastic utensils because they could not wash dishes. One    woman said she had not had running water in her home for 10 days. Her two sons have spent hours each day lining up to fill jugs from the well at their mosque. They use that to drink and to wash dishes, collecting the runoff to flush the toilet. ?My family?s dream is to get a warm shower,? she said, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions for communicating with a foreign news outlet without government permission. ?It has become our ultimate hope in Damascus to have enough water to take showers and wash clothes in the automatic washing machine. ? She expressed anger that Syria?s   news media had said little about the water crisis, instead focusing on the military?s battles with rebels. ?We are fed up with the news of military operations,? she said. ?We want news about water and water supply schedules. ? Despite the water crisis, conditions in Damascus are far better than those in Aleppo, the northern city and former commercial epicenter of the country, where Syrian and Russian forces prevailed last month after prolonged bombardments of its eastern side. While the   appears to be holding there, the formerly   eastern quarters are abandoned wastelands, United Nations relief officials said. ?Nothing prepared us for what we saw,? Sajjad Malik, the United Nations acting humanitarian coordinator for Syria, told reporters Wednesday in a telephone briefing from Aleppo. ?The infrastructure was destroyed in almost every neighborhood. ? Mr. Malik said more than 100 United Nations relief workers from several agencies were helping civil defense teams remove debris and provide emergency food, water, shelter and medical care in the city, where four million people once lived. He estimated that 1. 5 million people remain in Aleppo, mostly on the western side, including roughly 400, 000 Syrians displaced from other areas. He also said thousands of displaced residents from the eastern side were starting to return, even if their homes and businesses were badly damaged or destroyed. ?They?re beginning to talk about rebuilding their lives and livelihoods,? Mr. Malik said. But he cautioned that ?Aleppo?s reconstruction is going to take a much longer time and way more resources than we have right now. ?"
17469,Kevin Sack and Alan Blinder,9/01/2017,2017,1,crime,"CHARLESTON, S. C.  ?   The federal trial to determine whether Dylann S. Roof will receive the death penalty for his murderous rampage at an   church has become a delicate balancing act, pitting the desire of prosecutors to convey the fullness of grief for the nine devout victims against the due process rights of an unrepentant white supremacist who largely declines to defend himself. In three days of   testimony last week, prosecutors questioned 20 spouses, children, grandchildren and friends of the victims to draw painfully poignant portraits of men and women who were pillars of their church, families and community. Jurors heard not only the tributes of the bereaved but in some cases the voices of the dead  ?   recordings of the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney lecturing proudly about the   history of Emanuel A. M. E. Church, the Rev. DePayne Middleton Doctor booming a soulful a cappella solo, the Rev. Sharonda   praying in a crescendo at the funeral of a friend. The government?s lawyers called two or three witnesses to render a portrait of each victim testimony about one of the deceased  ?   the youngest,    Tywanza Sanders  ?   remains for Monday. The prosecution plans to rest its case that day, and Mr. Roof, who is representing himself, has said he will not call any witnesses. Closing arguments are expected on Tuesday. Mr. Roof, 22, stared straight ahead or down at the defense table, avoiding eye contact with witnesses who lost composure on the stand and jurors who sometimes dabbed away tears. When a prosecutor would conclude his gentle questioning, which could draw on for more than an hour, Judge Richard M. Gergel of Federal District Court would call for  . Mr. Roof, dressed in a   sweater and slacks, would rise slightly from his seat and announce: ?No questions. ? That dynamic has prompted a series of challenges by Mr. Roof, and pointed exchanges between Judge Gergel and David I. Bruck, the veteran,   capital defender whom Mr. Roof has sidelined, about how much is too much. ?It is not fair to allow that much testimony to be heard by the jury when I am not presenting any evidence  ?   from my family or anyone else  ?   in mitigation,? Mr. Roof argued on Wednesday in a motion that Judge Gergel denied. ?If I don?t present any mitigation evidence, the   evidence will take over the whole sentencing trial and guarantee that I get the death penalty. ? Found guilty in December on 33 counts, including 18 that carry a potential death sentence, Mr. Roof has rejected Mr. Bruck?s strategy of presenting evidence about his background and mental health that might mitigate against his execution. The lawyer has been relegated to the role of standby counsel, allowed to sit beside Mr. Roof and offer guidance but not to question witnesses or to object to the government?s evidence. The usually   Mr. Bruck has not been able to contain his frustration. At several points last week, with the jury out of the courtroom, he pleaded with Judge Gergel to rein in the prosecution and to empower him to object to testimony. ?This is sentencing it is not a memorial service,? said Mr. Bruck, who has often expressed his admiration for the victims and his sorrow for their families. ?It has become a runaway freight train. ? Mr. Bruck told Judge Gergel that Mr. Roof did not have the capacity or courage to offer objections and consistently ignored the suggestions he passed along in notes. He said he had advised Mr. Roof to move for a mistrial. Judge Gergel has had none of it. He lectured Mr. Bruck that he had twice held competency hearings and determined that Mr. Roof met the legal thresholds to stand trial and represent himself, a constitutional right. ?I have not noticed the bashfulness to make an objection any time he feels it appropriate,? the judge told Mr. Bruck on Friday. He asked Mr. Roof if he felt uncomfortable doing so. ?No,? Mr. Roof replied, saying no more. The judge has, however, cautioned Julius N. Richardson, an assistant United States attorney, to restrict the number of victim impact witnesses and the length of their testimony. ?At some point it?s too much,? Judge Gergel said. ?I?m worried about the cumulative effect. ? Yet, he also acknowledged the emotion of the memories offered from the stand. ?There is no antiseptic way to do this,? he said. Although they gradually acceded to Judge Gergel?s suggestion to ?streamline? their case, prosecutors have argued that the scale of the massacre justified a large number of witnesses. ?He is the one who chose to kill nine people,? Mr. Richardson said of Mr. Roof, who, according to testimony, wore shoes to a closed hearing last week bearing a   symbol of white supremacy. ?He is the one who chose to go into a church to do it, and he?s the one who chose to do it to particularly good people. ? Impact statements at capital trials  ?   and the legal questions surrounding them  ?   rose to prominence in the 1980s as victims? rights advocates won public support, including the passage of a law that altered the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. But in 1987, the United States Supreme Court ruled that such evidence in capital cases was a ?constitutionally unacceptable risk. ? Four years later, it reversed that position when it ruled in Payne v. Tennessee. ?Victim impact evidence is simply another form or method of informing the sentencing authority about the specific harm caused by the crime in question,? Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote for the    majority. Such evidence has become a staple of capital proceedings. Before Timothy McVeigh was sentenced to death for the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, which killed 168 people, prosecutors called 38 victim impact witnesses, Mr. Roof noted in a motion. More than a dozen testified at the 2015 trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who received the death penalty for the Boston Marathon attack that left three people dead and more than 250 wounded. Researchers have repeatedly found that such evidence has substantial effects on jurors who are weighing capital punishment. Mr. Roof?s choice to not call witnesses means that jurors will ?not hear that evidence which tends to dampen the emotional effect? of grieving relatives, said Scott E. Sundby, a law professor at the University of Miami who has studied juror behavior in capital cases. Victim impact witnesses cannot, by law, opine about the penalty they prefer. But the jurors in Charleston have heard stories of intense suffering and loss, one after another. Prosecutors began by eliciting heartfelt reminiscences of family gatherings and final conversations, then pivoted to the excruciating moments of discovery after the killings of June 17, 2015. ?I dropped the phone and just started jumping and fell on the floor and stayed there for two hours,? recalled Bethane Middleton Brown, Ms. Doctor?s sister. ?I couldn?t move. ? Jurors saw an affecting video of Chris Singleton, the son of Ms.   rapping a tribute to his charismatic mother: ?Took your life in the middle of the church, and I just pray, Mama, that you weren?t hurt. ? They heard Malcolm R. Graham, a former North Carolina state senator, describe the deep void left by the death of his sister, Cynthia Hurd, a longtime county librarian who served as his mentor and political guide. ?I?m alive, I?m fit, but something is missing,? he said. ?I can?t go to the store and replace it. I can?t reinvent it. ? Walter Jackson Jr. seemed to find cruel irony in his grandmother Susie Jackson?s being taken in a hate crime. ?She was 87 when she passed, and that?s someone who?s gone through racism, discrimination, segregation,? he said. ?Yet she was still that kind of person who still had that unconditional love for everyone. ? Daniel L. Simmons Jr. told of his initial bewilderment that his father, the Rev. Daniel Simmons Sr. a    Vietnam veteran with a license to carry a concealed weapon, had not done more to protect the churchgoers as he always had his family. He got his answer after receiving the keys to his father?s car from the coroner and finding the gun inside. ?When I opened the car, it was sitting on the front seat,? Mr. Simmons said. ?He took it off before he went to church. ? Death penalty critics complain that the testimony here has traded on the inherent nobility of the victims to advance what they consider the most ignoble of punishments, one that many members of the families say they oppose. They note the paradox that a death sentence for Mr. Roof may bolster support for maintaining a penalty that has been inflicted disproportionately on  . Some said the impact evidence may produce grounds for an appeal. Henderson Hill, a lawyer who founded the Center for Death Penalty Litigation and who attended the proceedings last week, said the tenor amounted to ?a whistle for a life for a life. ? ?This is so far past the pale of what is acceptable practice that I find it just unrecognizable as a capital sentencing proceeding,? he said. ?I?ve never seen this kind of celebration of life, even in black churches where the traditions are that services go on forever. ?"
18029,Niraj Chokshi,27/01/2017,2017,1,business,"A mishandled handoff between foremen may have played a role in an Amtrak crash last April in which two workers were killed when a train slammed into construction equipment that was on the tracks near Chester, Pa. according to documents released on Thursday. The documents, part of a continuing investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board, also revealed the train?s operator tested positive for marijuana, and show a supervisor?s distress upon hearing that the track had been cleared for use. ?Oh my gosh you?ve got to be kidding me,? John Yaeger, an Amtrak day shift foreman whose shift had just begun, told a dispatcher, according to a transcript of radio communications from that morning. ?Oh man. The backhoe got plowed. I can?t believe it. ? The documents released on Thursday do not draw conclusions about what caused the crash, though possible factors are cited. The crash occurred around 7:50 a. m. on April 3, when the train struck a backhoe that was being used during a multiday maintenance operation on a neighboring track, according to the documents. During an interview with investigators, Mr. Yaeger suggested there had been confusion in the handoff from a night foreman about whether the track had been cleared for traffic. The backhoe operator, Joseph Carter Jr. 61, and his supervisor, Peter Adamovich, 59, died.   people were taken to hospitals. The preliminary N. T. S. B. documents consist of hundreds of pages of interviews, transcripts and reports, and include the revelation that the train?s operator, Alexander Hunter, tested positive for marijuana that day. Efforts to reach Mr. Hunter on Thursday evening were not immediately successful. The train was traveling south at 106 miles per hour  ?   within the authorized limit of 110 m. p. h.  ?   when Mr. Hunter applied the emergency brakes after ?seeing something? on Main Track 3, according to the documents. He was able to slow the train to only 88 m. p. h. before striking the backhoe. ?The collision obliterated the backhoe, sending pieces of the equipment throughout the area and into the west side of the first passenger coach,? according to an analysis report. Amtrak estimated the damage at $2. 5 million."
18334,Mike McPhate,6/02/2017,2017,2,science,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here?s the  .) More than 1, 300 lives are cut short each year in the Los Angeles area because of air pollution, scientists say. Now, after years of work, regulators are getting ready to adopt their most substantial plan in more than a decade to do something about it. The proposal is outlined in   pages from the South Coast Air Quality Management District, whose jurisdiction extends across Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino Counties. Not surprisingly, it has set off debate, as critics have called the plan too lenient on industry. ?California has made clear that it intends to be a leader on environmental issues,? said Angela Johnson Meszaros, a staff attorney with Earthjustice, an environmental law group. ?And here we?ve got the Los Angeles air agency not doing all that it can. ? All sides recognize that industries under the agency?s regulatory power  ?   including refineries, ports and warehouses  ?   must adopt cleaner technologies. The agreement breaks down over how to get there. The draft blueprint would adopt some tougher emissions rules. But it also calls for a carrot approach: roughly $15 billion in handouts over the next 15 years to encourage polluters to clean up. Some community leaders have portrayed the incentives  ?   which would surely involve tax increases  ?   as a form of corporate welfare at the expense of   families. But supporters of the plan have argued that they are needed to avoid stifling business. Smaller operators, for example, may not be able to afford a new, cleaner truck. ?Obviously you can?t make everybody happy,? said Philip M. Fine, deputy executive officer for the air district. ?But we think we?ve developed a sensible, comprehensive and regulatory approach. ? At a public meeting last Friday, the air agency?s board was supposed to vote on a final version of the plan. Hundreds of people showed up, filling overflow rooms. Testimony included stories of the personal toll that asthma is taking on young Californians. Business leaders warned of job losses if the plan were amended to add new rules. In the end, the board postponed the vote, citing the unexpected absence of a member. They?ll try again next month.

17676,Katie Thomas,22/03/2017,2017,3,entertainment,"SAN FRANCISCO  ?   Innate Immunotherapeutics is a tiny pharmaceutical company from Australia that has no approved drugs and no backing from flashy venture capital firms, and trades for just over a dollar a share on the Australian Stock Exchange. More than once, the company has run out of money and nearly closed its doors. But despite its unremarkable profile, Innate has some surprisingly influential boosters in Washington. The congressional liaison to   Donald J. Trump?s transition team, Representative Chris Collins, Republican of New York, is the company?s largest shareholder and sits on the board. Representative Tom Price of Georgia, Mr. Trump?s nominee to be secretary of health and human services, purchased shares of Innate four times in 2015 and 2016, according to congressional financial disclosures, totaling between $60, 000 and $110, 000. Other Washington power players with investments in the company include Michael Hook, Mr. Collins?s chief of staff, who is a top shareholder, and Bill Paxon, a Washington lobbyist and former congressman, according to company filings and congressional financial disclosures. Last summer, Mr. Price, Mr. Hook and Mr. Paxon bought the stock at a discount as part of a private offering organized by Innate aimed at ?sophisticated U. S. investors. ? They have since quintupled their money, at least on paper. Mr. Price?s investments in health care companies, including Innate, are almost certain to be a focus of questioning during his confirmation hearings next week. Some prominent Democrats are already asking whether he may have crossed ethical lines by investing in companies that stood to benefit from legislation he helped shape. Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Louise Slaughter of New York and other Democrats have called for investigations into Mr. Price?s trades. On Wednesday, Mr. Price, who as health secretary would oversee the Food and Drug Administration, filed papers with the federal government saying he would divest himself of interests in several health care companies, including Innate. Phillip J. Blando, a spokesman for the presidential transition, said that Mr. Price took ?his obligation to uphold the public trust very seriously,? and that the Office of Government Ethics had completed an ?exhaustive? review of his financial holdings. Representatives of Mr. Price and Mr. Collins say they have not broken any rules, but what has puzzled Washington and industry insiders alike is how a   Australian biotech, with only one experimental multiple sclerosis drug under development, attracted a coterie of Washington investors, including the man who is likely to become the next health secretary. ?Maybe Chris is just a cheerleader for the company and Tom Price jumped in head over heels,? said Craig Holman, the government affairs lobbyist for Public Citizen, a consumer group, which has asked for an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. ?But it?s got to be taken a look at. It?s just so suspicious, someone?s got to ask, ?What just happened? ?? Mr. Collins and Mr. Price have both been active in shaping health care legislation, and both voted in favor of the 21st Century Cures Act, which was backed by the pharmaceutical industry and included measures that would allow the F. D. A. to approve drugs more quickly. Mr. Price is a member of the House Ways and Means Committee?s subcommittee on health, and Mr. Collins serves on the health panel of the Energy and Commerce Committee. A spokesman for Mr. Collins said the congressman had followed all ethical guidelines and said Innate was one of many companies he had been involved in. ?He is very proud of the progress the company has made over the years and hopeful it will be able to develop a potentially lifesaving treatment for the millions of individuals suffering from secondary progressive multiple sclerosis,? said the spokesman, Michael McAdams. In an interview this week in San Francisco, Innate?s chief executive, Simon Wilkinson, seemed amused at all of the attention now being paid to what he described as his ?little biotech at the wrong end of the world. ? Mr. Wilkinson and Michael Quinn, Innate?s chairman, said they had never heard of many of the company?s more prominent investors, and said they first learned that Mr. Price had invested in the company from an article in The Wall Street Journal, which first reported his investment. They also said they had not heard of Mr. Hook, the   shareholder, or Mr. Paxon and said they had little interest in gaining the ear of powerful Washington players. Their goal, they said, is to sell the company to a larger pharmaceutical company. ?It won?t be up to us to seek approval for the drug,? Mr. Wilkinson said in the interview, which took place at his hotel on a rundown block in San Francisco, where he was pitching the company to potential buyers at the JPMorgan Health Care Conference. Like many biotech   Innate has had ups and downs, Mr. Wilkinson said. ?But sometimes, things happen,? he added. In his case, he said, ?I met Chris. ? Mr. Wilkinson said he was on a   trip to the United States in 2005 when the two met, and he made his pitch to Mr. Collins, who was then a businessman with a reputation for turning around struggling companies. Mr. Collins decided to invest in the company, eventually joining its board. In 2007, Mr. Collins was elected county executive of Erie County, which includes Buffalo, and in 2012, he won election to Congress. He remained on Innate?s board, and Mr. Wilkinson and Mr. Quinn said his new political career has had little impact. ?If anything, I suspect it?s probably a negative,? Mr. Quinn said. ?Because he?s a bit harder to access  ?   he?s just busy. ? Mr. Collins remained one of the company?s top cheerleaders, enlisting many of his associates as investors and even lending the company money a handful of times when it was at risk of going out of business. Today, many of Innate?s biggest shareholders have ties to Mr. Collins. They include two of his adult children, Caitlin and Cameron, who are the company?s   and   shareholders, as well as several Buffalo businessmen who have donated to his political campaigns, according to company filings and campaign finance disclosures. Lindy Ruff, the head coach of the Dallas Stars hockey team and a former player and coach for the Buffalo Sabres, is also an investor. Innate?s sole drug in development, MIS416, is in clinical trials in Australia and New Zealand to evaluate whether it works in people with an advanced form of multiple sclerosis. A midlevel trial is underway, and results are due in the middle of this year. Experts in congressional ethics and trading rules said there did not appear to be evidence that Mr. Collins or Mr. Price used nonpublic information to steer their investment activities, a practice that would violate what is known as the Stock Act, which bans insider trading by members of Congress. But, said Donna M. Nagy, a law professor at Indiana University who has written on the financial investments by members of Congress, ?One needs facts in order to get answers to those questions, and coming up with the facts for that is going to be difficult. ? Mr. Holman of Public Citizen said Mr. Collins?s recruiting efforts among Washington power players created the opportunity for ?influence peddling. ? For example, Mr. Paxon, who represented Mr. Collins?s congressional district in the 1990s, could appear before Mr. Collins as both a lobbyist and a fellow investor in Innate. ?It?s a very effective means of buying access and hopefully influencing politicians,? Mr. Holman said. Mr. Collins?s spokesman said Mr. Paxon and Mr. Collins had never discussed Innate and noted that, because they are both from the Buffalo area, he might have become aware of Innate through other investors in the region. Mr. Paxon did not respond to emails and a call for comment. Last summer, Innate offered a select opportunity to United States investors, one that Mr. Collins?s friends and associates appear to have benefited from. Under what is known as a private placement, Innate sold a limited number of shares at a discount in an effort to raise capital. In company filings, Innate said one offering of the shares would be sold to ?sophisticated U. S. investors? and would be used, among other things, to finance a clinical trial and to gain permission from the F. D. A. to start a process that could lead to applying for approval of the drug in the United States. Last summer, Mr. Price, Mr. Hook and Mr. Paxon were among 16 entities that took part in the private American placement, as did several other of Mr. Collins?s associates and donors, according to the company filing. Mr. Price and Mr. Hook also participated in a second offering in the summer, the filings show. Mr. Price purchased between $50, 000 and $100, 000 in Innate shares in August, which was among the largest stock buys he had made since 2012, according to congressional financial disclosures. The investment was larger than his trades in more established pharmaceutical stocks like Pfizer and Merck. With his discount from the private placements, Mr. Price would have purchased some stock at 25 Australian cents per share in August and some at 34 cents. The stock closed on Friday at $1. 31. Mr. McAdams, Mr. Collins?s spokesman, said the private placement was available to qualified American investors and said Mr. Hook had previously invested in a private placement with the company in 2009, before Mr. Collins was a congressman. Several other investors were longtime friends of Mr. Collins, Mr. McAdams said, and their investment predates his time in Congress. Mr. Quinn dismissed questions about whether anyone engaged in insider trading and said the company?s stock had been rising in anticipation of the results of the clinical trial later this year. The outcome of such trials is typically kept secret from investors and even company executives. ?Right now the whole value of this thing swings on a bet on the study results,? he said. In San Francisco this week, Mr. Wilkinson said he had received interest in a possible acquisition from about 20 ?high grade? pharmaceutical companies. The drug, if approved, would be the first to treat a progressive form of multiple sclerosis. But he was also   noting wryly that Innate was such a ?bottom feeder? at the JPMorgan conference that the company had not even qualified for an invitation to attend the main event."
17409,Margaret Lyons,6/01/2017,2017,1,entertainment,"Perhaps the documentary ?Bright Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds? would seem less poignant and compelling had its subjects not just died, or had they not died, stunningly, within a day of each other. But the movie?s plucky intimacy shines through that fog. It?s a portrait, not a tribute  ?   though as the documentary reminds us, every portrait is in some way a tribute to something. The film, directed by the actor Fisher Stevens and Alexis Bloom, debuts on HBO Saturday night after the cable network moved up its premiere from March. That decision is hard to begrudge. As this movie makes evident, these two were no strangers to making headlines. Ms. Reynolds was well known to one generation for, in part, the tabloid bonanza surrounding her when her husband Eddie Fisher skipped out with her best friend, Elizabeth Taylor. Several other generations have grown up surrounded by all things Princess Leia, memorably played by Ms. Fisher in the ?Star Wars? films. ?Bright Lights? finds mother and daughter living in separate houses in what they call ?the compound. ? Ms. Fisher takes a souffl? out of her oven and carries it on a tray down the path to her mother?s house. ?I usually come to her,? Ms. Fisher says. She pauses. ?I always come to her. ? Who wouldn?t? She?s Debbie Reynolds, movie star and cabaret performer. Ms. Reynolds rose to fame with cheery, wholesome roles, and even in her 80s could turn on that pert sunniness in a split second, so smoothly you?d never know it was an act  ?   except that this is a documentary, and it includes the footage of just before this light clicks on. ?It?s not my best day,? she sighs, sounding weary and a little   as she and Mr. Stevens discuss where exactly the camera will be. And then  ?   bing!  ?   there she is, as perky as a kindergarten teacher. Because the gently quirky celebrity documentary is an enjoyable if standardized format, the potency of ?Bright Lights? sneaks up on you. If it were just about its subjects? huge, starry lives, that really would be enough for a documentary. But it also smartly, and subtly, pushes its audience to ask two of modern pop society?s central, uncomfortable questions: First, are famous people ?real? people? And second, am I becoming my mother? By the time Mr. Stevens and Ms. Bloom start filming, this almost cosmic   between mother and daughter seems to have resolved itself to a wry but balanced mutual orbit. Though both women seem a little reluctant to admit it, the similarities between them abound. Ms. Fisher?s house is decorated eclectically, with memorabilia and silly knickknacks everywhere. Ms. Reynolds?s collection is far more orderly: She was among Hollywood?s great archivists and had hoped to open a museum, but instead is resigned to auctioning off many of her pieces, including Marilyn Monroe?s famous   dress from ?The Seven Year Itch? and a pair of Judy Garland?s   shoes from ?The Wizard of Oz. ? ?I like my ghosts,? she tells her daughter. Ms. Fisher is brainy and salty and hilarious, and she?s frank and eloquent in describing being bipolar. We see both archival and    footage of Ms. Fisher in manic phases, and she?s articulate, artful even, about her  . ?One mood is the meal the next mood is the check,? she says. But she too knows how to flip the switch. She refers to her appearances at fan conventions as ?the lap dance,? but engages with her fans nonetheless. A woman cries. Little girls in their Princess Leia costumes beam. Their heroine gamely poses for photo after photo, signing every manner of memorabilia. It?s not so different, really, from her mother?s cabaret act. That nightclub act comes up several times in ?Bright Lights,? including footage of a    Carrie being summoned to the stage to sing ?Bridge Over Troubled Water. ? Her bold alto voice and sassy   almost, but don?t quite, belie that she?s a barely cooperative teenager desperate to rebel. Ms. Fisher says she rejected singing more or less to spite her mother. Six or so years after that nightclub performance, she married Paul Simon. You know. The guy who wrote ?Bridge Over Troubled Water. ? It?s all so Hollywood, so poetic, so dramatic. Despite their extraordinary circumstances, much of the family banter among Ms. Reynolds her son, Todd Fisher and Ms. Fisher seems like ordinary talk. Adult siblings agonize over an aging parent?s finances and  . Mother and daughter have the same shoes. Brother and sister exchange knowing ?well, that?s Mom? shrugs. There?s no people like show people, but Hollywood families are, somehow, still just families."

17397,Bill Vlasic,5/01/2017,2017,1,entertainment,"DETROIT  ?   Unexpectedly strong sales of new vehicles in the United States in December propelled the industry to another record figure in 2016: 17. 55 million sold. That is the good news. The bad news, though, is that the late push to beat the previous record, 17. 47 million vehicles sold in 2015, came at a steep cost, as companies piled on higher sales incentives to lure consumers to their showrooms. And with the American market tilting more than ever toward sales of pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, companies are cutting production of passenger cars to reduce big inventories of   models. As a result, there is little expectation that the sales will continue on this upward trajectory  ?   at least not without cutting deep into profits. That means the numbers released Wednesday could be the   mark for the industry?s impressive comeback from the depths of the recession, when annual sales fell below 11 million vehicles and General Motors and Chrysler needed government bailouts to survive. Adding to the challenge is the potential for major changes in federal regulatory and trade policies by the Trump administration, setting up an uncertain year for an industry that has been barreling along. ?One of the problems with predicting 2017 is it is the year of unknowns,? said Michelle Krebs, an analyst with the   site Autotrader. ?We are hearing a lot of different things about border tariffs and regulatory policies, but we don?t know what the whole picture looks like. ? Most major automakers are making big profits these days, as consumers replace aging cars and trucks with new models, loaded with technology, that last year sold for an average sticker price above $35, 000. Yet companies face a new set of challenges posed by slower growth, and industry executives are bracing for potential tariffs on vehicles imported into the United States from Mexico, or other adjustments in trade policies that could upset the global pipeline of parts to vehicle assembly plants. The uncertainty extends to the market itself, which has steadily grown year after year as consumers took advantage of easy credit and better economic conditions to replace aging vehicles. Demand, however, has leveled off, and companies are falling back on old habits to move excess inventories. Analysts reported that sales incentives were about 25 percent higher in the fourth quarter of 2016 than in the same period a year earlier, even though overall sales were flat. That is partly because of a sustained slump in sales of small and midsize cars, which has offset the increased demand for trucks and S. U. V. s. But it forces automakers to rely on discounts to sell less popular models, adjust production plans on the fly and lay off workers at some of their factories. General Motors, the nation?s largest automaker, has announced plans to cut shifts of workers at three assembly plants that build cars in Michigan and Ohio, and analysts expect more adjustments across the industry as companies try to better match supply with demand. ?We do expect production will likely be cut, particularly in the compact and midsize segments,? said Alec Gutierrez, an analyst with the research firm Kelley Blue Book. The industry sold 1. 69 million vehicles during the month of December, an increase of about 3 percent from the same period a year earlier, according to the research firm Autodata. The 17. 55 million sold over the year was a gain of 0. 4 percent. Sales of trucks and S. U. V.s accounted for nearly   of the sales volume during December as consumers continue to turn to the larger vehicles over cars. Analysts expect the trend toward larger vehicles to continue as long as gas prices remain low. Over all, the industry forecasts sales exceeding 17 million vehicles in the United States in the coming year, although how automakers manage shifts in demand will affect their profitability. ?The most successful automakers in the long term will be able to prioritize profitability over market share and be willing to pull back artificial support for unprofitable volume,? said Stephanie Brinkley, an analyst at the firm IHS Markit. G. M. said its sales in December increased 10 percent, to 319, 000 vehicles, although its annual sales for all of 2016 fell 1. 3 percent, to 3. 04 million vehicles. The company benefited from strong demand for pickups and its biggest S. U. V. s, such as the Chevrolet Tahoe, whose sales rose nearly 17 percent last year. But G. M. exemplified the market?s split personality, as several of its smaller cars experienced sharp declines. G. M. is expanding its S. U. V. lineup and will unveil new models at the coming Detroit auto show. Moreover, the company expects the industry to achieve   levels again in 2017. ?Key economic indicators, especially consumer confidence, continue to reflect optimism about the U. S. economy,? said Mustafa Mohatarem, G. M.?s chief economist. Ford Motor, the   American automaker, said it sold 237, 000 vehicles in December, a slight gain from the same month in 2015. For the year, Ford reported sales of 2. 61 million vehicles in the United States  ?   essentially the same total as in 2015. The company?s cornerstone product, the   pickup, was once again the   vehicle in the American market, with 820, 000 trucks sold last year. But sales of Ford?s car models fell about 12 percent in 2016 from a year earlier, with products like the Focus and the Fusion posting   declines. The third major American automaker, Fiat Chrysler, reported one of its weaker months in December, as sales fell 10 percent, to 192, 000 vehicles. For the full year, the company said it sold 2. 24 million vehicles, a decline of less than 1 percent from the previous year. Fiat Chrysler has substantially reduced its production of passenger cars and is busy converting car factories into truck plants. Last year, sales of its cars such as the Dodge Dart and the Chrysler 200 dropped precipitously as the company concentrated on beefing up its lineup of S. U. V. s, particularly its   Jeep models. Foreign automakers generally reported solid months in December. Toyota, for example, said its sales increased 2 percent during the month, although it ended 2016 with a 2 percent decrease for the full year. While the industry?s health appears closely tied to the continued demand for larger vehicles, some automakers have placed big bets on electric cars, which remain a tiny niche in the market. In one of the most closely watched introductions in the segment, G. M. said it sold 579 Chevrolet Bolts, a new   sedan, in December, its first month of sales. By contrast, the company sold more than 54, 000 Silverado pickups, its most popular product."
18315,Andrew Higgins,12/02/2017,2017,2,politics,"NICOSIA, Cyprus  ?   As the United Nations geared up for negotiations that it declared the ?best and last chance? to unite Cyprus after more than four decades of acrimonious division, Russia?s ambassador attended a seminar dedicated to derailing any prospect of an agreement between Greek and Turkish Cypriots. The presence of the ambassador, Stanislav Osadchiy, delighted   Greek Cypriot politicians in Nicosia, the capital of the   south of the divided island. They had helped torpedo a 2004 reunification plan supported by the United States and have now rallied together to defeat a new push for a settlement that began on Jan. 12 with an international conference in Geneva. But Mr. Osadchiy?s attendance at the seminar, which Western and other diplomats shunned, angered Nicos Anastasiades, the   president of the Republic of Cyprus and a strong supporter of efforts to resolve an interethnic dispute as intractable and nearly as protracted as the   conflict. In an interview in Nicosia, Mr. Anastasiades said that, when questioned, the ambassador had apologized and said he had misunderstood the nature of the seminar, despite its clear   agenda and the fact that it had been organized by five small political parties all bitterly opposed to a compromise deal in Geneva. The president said he accepted the ambassador?s explanation and his insistence that he had not meant to endorse the   rejectionists by attending. But, Mr. Anastasiades added, ?I consider any intervention by any third country as not what we are looking for. ? Like countless previous diplomatic efforts to reunite Cyprus since Turkey invaded in 1974 and split the country in two, the recent Geneva talks failed to achieve a breakthrough, though they did make some progress. Mr. Anastasiades said the two sides were ?halfway? to an agreement but still had deep divisions, notably on the issue of whether Turkey, Greece and Britain, the former colonial master, should retain their status as ?guarantors? of the island?s security, a setup that Russia rejects. Bound to Russia by a shared Orthodox Christian faith and its role as a financial and banking center for Russian business, the Republic of Cyprus, the   nation in the south of the island, has long looked to Moscow as a protector rather than a troublemaker. But accusations that Moscow intervened to skew the United States presidential election and supported   forces across Europe have stirred a wave of alarm about Russia in the European Union, of which the Republic of Cyprus is a member. This alarm, which Russia dismisses as Russophobic hysteria, has given new force to voices in Cyprus warning that Russia?s geopolitical interests have made it determined to upset a Cyprus settlement. Makarios Drousiotis, a   researcher who has long bucked   sentiment in Cyprus and sought to expose what he sees as Russian meddling, said events in the United States and Europe were shaking his compatriots? view that Moscow had only their best interests at heart. ?What they have been doing in America and Europe they have been doing for 50 years in Cyprus,? said Mr. Drousiotis, who in 2014 published a book, ?The Cyprus Crisis and the Cold War,? that demolished what he called a   ?myth? that the West is to blame for Turkey?s 1974 invasion of the island and the decades of division that followed. The book, denounced by Russia?s diplomatic mission in Nicosia as ?politically unacceptable,? portrayed Moscow as a duplicitous partner that had for decades used disinformation, front organizations and other tools of subterfuge to woo support among   while working behind the scenes to stoke tensions to ensure that Cyprus never aligned too firmly with the West or became a NATO member. To Moscow?s fury, this once taboo view that Russia wants to block a settlement has in recent weeks been discussed openly in some Cypriot media outlets. The Cyprus Mail, for example, described Russia?s ambassador, Mr. Osadchiy, as ?the darling? of   forces ?because he regularly says things aimed at undermining the talks or making the pursuit of a deal more difficult. ? Maria Zakharova, Russia?s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, said Moscow was ?surprised by the   comments in the Cyprus media? and accused the media of creating ?a smoke screen for the real problems that need to be tackled as part of the Cypriot settlement. ? Mr. Drousiotis said the Russian ambassador?s apparent support for   rejectionist politicians ahead of the Geneva talks fit a long, but previously mostly ignored, pattern. ?Every time there has been an attempt to solve the Cyprus issue, the Russians have jumped in to block a settlement,? Mr. Drousiotis said. A solution in Cyprus would end a deep rift within NATO between Turkey and Greece, both members, and open the way to the development of large gas reserves in the eastern Mediterranean that could upset the grip of Gazprom, Russia?s   energy giant, on the Turkish market. Turkey imports nearly 99 percent of its natural gas, more than half from Russia, its biggest supplier by far. Gas from Egyptian, Israeli and Cypriot fields in the Mediterranean would be cheaper than supplies from Gazprom, but it has little chance of reaching Turkish consumers so long as arguments over territorial waters and other matters between Greek and Turkish Cypriots obstruct the development of pipelines. In 2004, ahead of a referendum in Cyprus on whether to accept a reunification plan proposed by Kofi Annan, who was the secretary general of the United Nations at the time, Russia vetoed a Security Council resolution relating to security arrangements on the island that all other Council members supported. Hopes for the   Annan plan then took another big blow when AKEL, the influential   communist party in southern Cyprus, dropped its previous support and, on the eve of the referendum, urged voters to reject the plan, as did the Orthodox Church. In the end, the north voted to accept the plan, while voters in the south rejected it. Yet another international effort collapsed after hackers penetrated the United Nations computer system and, in 2009, leaked emails and documents to a   Cypriot newspaper. Some of the documents were doctored in a way that inflamed   fears of any settlement. The United Nations concluded that only a foreign intelligence service could have orchestrated such an operation. Mr. Anastasiades, speaking at the presidential palace in Nicosia, said that his country counted Russia as a friend, but that it had to take care not to give fuel to those who questioned Russia?s intentions, as the ambassador did by attending the seminar. Russia has responded angrily to accusations that it has been working against its own stated policy in favor of a Cyprus solution. Vladimir A. Chizhov, Russia?s ambassador to the European Union, issued a scathing statement on Jan. 13 to denounce what he called ?preposterous? reports that Russia wanted to block a settlement. ?Evidently,   hysteria is becoming contagious. Overzealous fighters of the (dis) information front are working day and night trying to implicate Russia in all sorts of problems, including those that are the direct result of shortsighted and arrogant policies of others,? Mr. Chizhov, a veteran diplomat who earlier served at the embassy in Nicosia, said in the statement. Harry Tzimitras, director of the Nicosia branch of the Peace Research Institute Oslo, said many obstacles blocked a settlement irrespective of Russia, notably the gulf between Greek and Turkish Cypriots on the issue of whether the Turkish military should be allowed to keep troops on the island after reunification. ?The fundamental mistrust? between the two sides, Mr. Tzimitras said, is the main reason for the failure of decades of diplomatic efforts to reach a settlement. ?In Cyprus, you rarely fight facts,? he said. ?You fight perceptions and ghosts. ? All the same, he added, some think that Russia has many reasons, despite its public position, to want the island to stay divided. ?In this view, the status quo is working very well for Russia,? Mr. Tzimitras said. ?They don?t want it disrupted. ? Aside from strengthening NATO and damaging Gazprom, a reunification deal would deliver a success to the United States, whose diplomats have been particularly active in trying to prod Greece, Turkey and their ethnic kin in Cyprus toward an agreement. Mr. Anastasiades said the main obstacle to a solution was Turkey, whose increasingly autocratic president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, recently said Turkish troops must be allowed to stay in Cyprus ?forever. ? Mr. Anastasiades has forged good relations with the leader of   northern Cyprus, Mustafa Akinci, but, he said, ?the solution does not depend on the Turkish Cypriots but on Ankara?s will. ? The issue of troops is tightly connected with another big hurdle  ?   demands by Mr. Anastasiades, urged on by Russia, that Turkey, Greece and Britain be stripped of their role as guarantors. Moscow has long wanted to scrap this system, continuing a   policy that was based in part on its desire to weaken the role of Britain, a NATO member that has military bases and a listening post in Cyprus. Mr. Anastasiades said it was up to Mr. Erdogan to decide what he wanted. ?His rhetoric is that he is in favor, but what remains to be seen is whether in practice he is supporting a solution,? Mr. Anastasiades said. As for Russia and the United States, Mr. Anastasiades said, Cyprus understands ?the games superpowers play. ? ?We want the support of everyone who can give support,? he added. ?It is a matter of survival. ?"
17376,Reuters,3/01/2017,2017,1,entertainment,"The nation?s consumer watchdog agency on Tuesday ordered the   agencies TransUnion and Equifax to pay more than $23. 2 million in fines and restitution for deceiving customers about the usefulness of credit scores and the cost of obtaining them. The watchdog agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, said the payments would resolve charges that TransUnion and Equifax had lured consumers into enrolling in credit services advertised as free or costing only $1, but which could cost more than $200 a year. TransUnion will reimburse $13. 93 million to consumers and pay a $3 million civil fine, while Equifax will reimburse $3. 8 million and pay a $2. 5 million civil fine, the bureau said. Both companies will also modify their marketing practices. Among the changes, they will obtain customers? consent to enroll them in services in which fees begin after free trials and make it easier for them to cancel services they do not want. The bureau said the wrongful conduct had violated the     law and had occurred at TransUnion since July 2011 and at Equifax between July 2011 and March 2014. Many lenders rely on credit scores from TransUnion, Equifax and their rival Experian when lending money. But TransUnion and Equifax falsely represented the credit scores they sold to consumers as being the same scores that lenders used, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said. ?Credit scores are central to a consumer?s financial life, and people deserve honest and accurate information about them,? Richard Cordray, the bureau?s director, said in a statement. Neither TransUnion, which is based in Chicago, nor Equifax, which is based in Atlanta, admitted or denied wrongdoing. A TransUnion spokesman, David Blumberg, and an Equifax spokeswoman, Ines Gutzmer, said their companies believed that they had complied with the law and were committed to better educating consumers about their credit. Experian was not charged. A spokesman for the bureau did not immediately have additional comment. In 2015, under a separate settlement with 31 state attorneys general, the   agencies agreed to improve how they fixed mistakes and addressed disputes."
17554,John Otis,10/01/2017,2017,1,business,"For Najairee Davis, high school was synonymous with bouts of anger and frustration. She had the hallway fights, suspensions and detention to prove it. Early in Ms. Davis?s high school career, her father was incarcerated on manslaughter charges. ?I was just angry,? Ms. Davis, 18, recalled. ?I wouldn?t talk to anybody. I wasn?t feeling good about anything. ? Academics were no longer a priority she shut everyone out. And if pressed on anything, she said, she would pick fights with classmates. Ms. Davis got a bad reputation at school, and said it was not long before teachers simply assumed she was to blame for any confrontation. Everyone else went unpunished, she said. Her principal at Frederick Douglass Academy in West Harlem suggested she might benefit from transferring to a different school, one designed for students who struggle in more traditional education settings. Her boyfriend had attended such a school, and compared the experience to being surrounded by a supportive family. ?A family at school?? she recalled telling her boyfriend. ?I?m not really into people that much. ? But in September 2015, Ms. Davis took a chance and enrolled at the Brooklyn High School for Leadership and Community Service, a transfer school for students who are falling short of the credits they need to graduate. The school is a joint venture between New York City?s Education Department and Brooklyn Community Services, one of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund?s eight beneficiary organizations. ?I just felt like I wasn?t that excited about school anymore,? Ms. Davis said. ?It wasn?t exciting to me anymore, until I came to Leadership. ? At her new school, she received support from teachers who were compassionate and understanding and knew every student by name. She was also assigned an advocate counselor, who was on call to help with problems Ms. Davis had outside school. It became clear, she said, that Leadership was going to be a different kind of place to learn. ?I have to do better,? Ms. Davis said. ?It can?t be like my old school. It has to be different. ? Her classmates became friends, not targets of fights. After she became pregnant last year and the pregnancy started to show, teachers and students did not judge her as she walked the halls, she said. Instead, they fawned over her baby bump and wanted to know about her baby shower. Ms. Davis gave birth to her son, Kyree Cooper, in July. ?There?s not one day he doesn?t make me happy,? she said. Recently, she moved out of a home in Brownsville, Brooklyn, where she had lived with the grandmother who raised her. She moved in with Kyree?s father and grandfather. It was important that Ms. Davis?s grandmother not feel pressure to raise Kyree, she said. Ms. Davis earns money through a   internship with Educational Video Center, a program run by the Leadership school. ?I don?t want to be depending on anyone,? she said. ?Even if it isn?t the most money in the world, I want to get things for myself that I purchased with my   money. ? Brooklyn Community Services has continued to help. Recently, it used $300 in Neediest Cases funds to buy winter clothing for Ms. Davis and Kyree. Ms. Davis is on track to graduate by March. And she has fixed her sights on a career as an ultrasound technician. ?After becoming pregnant, I felt that job was a good job,? she said. ?I can be part of other people?s milestones, see their baby?s heartbeat for the first time. ? Newfound independence has so far proved more liberating than frightening. Even with the pitfalls of parenting she knows she will encounter, she said, she is determined to evolve and improve with each challenge she surmounts. ?I just want to experience stuff on my own,? Ms. Davis said. ?I want to make mistakes on my own. I know how it is having a parent saying, ?That?s not how you do it.? I want to learn that?s not how you do it. I want to try new things and be different. ? About her son, she said, ?I want to raise him the way I want to raise him. ?"
17572,Liz Alderman,12/01/2017,2017,1,business,"First it was the icy snow. Now comes the freezing rain. An arctic blast that has reached as far south as the Mediterranean is generating perilous conditions for thousands of refugees in overcrowded migrant camps in Greece and prompting the European Union to declare the situation ?untenable. ? On Wednesday, a Greek navy ship docked at Lesbos island to take on as many as 500 refugees. They have been struggling to survive the subzero temperatures in the severely overcrowded main camp in Moria, using pup tents that were supposed to be temporary when they were set up last year in warmer weather. Video and photos taken by migrants inside the camp and posted to social media showed flimsy shelters sagging under a blanket of snow, and people waiting in long lines in the falling snow for food and to use bathrooms. In one video, a man identifying himself as a migrant shows people lifting the flaps of   tents near a slushy pathway. ?Look at how human beings are living,? said the man, speaking French. Imploring officials of the European Union to look at the situation themselves, he said: ?Why can?t people leave here? How is it possible to live in these conditions, my God?? On Tuesday night, the snow turned to freezing rain, forming rivers of muck around the camp and drenching tents and clothing, aid organizations reported. On Samos, another island where the main migrant camp is overflowing, refugees reported freezing conditions with no heat. At refugee camps on the Greek mainland, and especially near the northern border, migrants continued to grapple with living outside under heavy snowfall. ?This is unbearable,? said Roland Schoenbauer, a spokesman for the United Nations high commissioner for refugees, who said he was receiving reports from doctors in camps across Greece warning of rising health risks from the cold and humidity. ?It shows what happens when you try to squeeze too many people into these camps. You can?t stockpile human beings. ? A year after the European Union sealed its borders to large numbers of newcomers, Greece remains Europe?s holding pen for nearly 60, 000 men, women and children. Many have been living for months in a distressing limbo in sordid refugee camps on the mainland and on Greek islands near Turkey, unable to move to countries where they hoped to seek asylum, and with no means or motivation to return to Syria, Iraq or other countries from which they fled war or economic hardship. Eric Kempson, a British citizen who has been living on Lesbos for over a decade, has been documenting the deteriorating conditions in the Moria refugee camp, posting videos of tents collapsing under the weight of snow and migrants slogging through muddy walkways. ?It is now heavy rain and melting snow, which is causing flooding in the camp,? Mr. Kempson wrote to The New York Times, via Facebook, describing the conditions in the camp on Wednesday. ?It?s like we begin the vicious circle again and nothing gets better, only worse. ? On Monday, the European Commission issued a statement saying the Greek refugee situation was the responsibility of Greek authorities. ?The situation has become untenable,? a spokeswoman, Natasha Bertaud, said in Brussels. The United Nations refugee agency and other aid groups have been working to move migrants from camps into better shelters, including hotels. In some cases, however, they have met resistance: Hotel owners on Samos, for example, were generally refusing to house migrants, Mr. Schoenbauer said. But a bigger problem is the extremely slow processing of asylum applications for those in the Greek camps. While the numbers of people streaming across the Aegean Sea from Turkey have slowed to a trickle after Turkey and the European Union signed a deal to resolve the crisis last March, thousands of migrants have yet to be registered for asylum. That is partly because the European Union has sent just a fraction of the assistance it pledged to Greece last year to help clear the backlog. A separate European Union plan to ease Greece?s burden by relocating tens of thousands of asylum seekers has also failed to take off, with European countries taking only a few thousand of the many stuck in Greece. The bottlenecks have overwhelmed many of the camps, especially on the Greek islands, where migrants arriving after the March deal are supposed to be held until being deported to Turkey. The camp at Moria, for instance, run by the Greek police and nongovernmental organizations and designed for about 3, 000 people, was reinforced with small container shelters that can each house up to 30 people. But hundreds of makeshift tents have been set up outside for months to accommodate an overflow of asylum seekers  ?   first under the beating Greek sun, and now under the pelting snow and rain. ?The snow is only the tip of the iceberg,? Mr. Schoenbauer said. ?The bigger problem is the overcrowding of the islands, and one reason for the overcrowding is the fact that the asylum procedure remains far too slow. ?"
18448,David Zucchino,10/02/2017,2017,2,business,"Times journalists are in Iraq?s Sunni heartland to evaluate rebuilding efforts after battles with the Islamic State. FALLUJA, Iraq  ?   Iraqi forces had taken Falluja from the Islamic State months before, and Sabah Rashid was more than ready to return home. But the police warned him not to go. Fleeing Islamic State fighters had rigged bombs all through his south Falluja neighborhood, and these had still not been cleared, they told him. Insurgent corpses were said to lay unrecovered. Mr. Rashid, 30, a determined sort, moved back into his ransacked house anyway  ?   he and his family fled the Islamic State three years ago and did not want to wait. Last week, they were camped out in their sagging house with no heat, electricity or running water. They boiled water on a wood fire. And they waited with mounting frustration for promised government aid. Nearly eight months after the recapture of Falluja showed that Iraq?s government could wrest one of the Islamic State?s major support bases away from it, the victory now seems at risk. The   national government has not yet demonstrated that it can secure and rebuild this shattered Sunni city, soothe sectarian grievances or provide for 250, 000 returning residents. Iraqi and American security officials now fear that if the Sunnis of Falluja are given no reason to trust the government, they may once again embrace the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and ISIL. Local officials say Islamic State sleeper cells remain active, and many residents continue to aid the insurgents. Guerrilla attacks have resumed in one of the most recent episodes, a suicide car bomb on Jan. 28 killed two police officers. The seeds of an incomplete victory were there from the start. Falluja had long been disaffected from the government, and it was the first Iraqi city to fall under Islamic State control. Even with the group mostly driven out, the government faced a widespread lack of trust. Further, the battle relied heavily on Shiite militia forces, many of which are backed by Iran, and reports of sectarian abuses of the Sunni population started almost immediately. In one case, the governor of surrounding Anbar Province said that militia fighters and some of their allies in the security forces had summarily executed 49 Sunnis from Falluja and tortured others. The government tried to keep the militias out of Falluja to avoid antagonizing Sunni residents. But many entered the city dressed as policemen, Sunni lawmakers said. Local officials said Shiite militiamen were now confined to checkpoints on Falluja?s outskirts, about 40 miles west of Baghdad. ?Of course, violations occurred in some places,? by Shiite militiamen, said Salam Ajmi, a Falluja municipal councilman. But now, he said, some Sunni residents were cooperating with security forces to help root out Islamic State sleeper cells. A visit to Falluja by Times journalists showed that last summer?s battle had left some sections of the city relatively unscathed, but had reduced others to rubble. Many streets were littered with crumpled buildings, collapsed roofs and   cars, all coated with gray dust. The skeleton of a crushed Humvee lay near Mr. Rashid?s home. For Mr. Rashid, the satisfaction of returning home was dimmed by resentment toward local Sunni officials charged with rebuilding the city. ?We get nothing from them but promises  ?   we are on our own,? he said as his two young sons fed dry grass to the campfire. The family members survive on food purchased at a newly opened market in a nearby district. Their own Al Alamin neighborhood offered only a bleak panorama of   homes and deserted streets. ?Falluja has had some hard lessons  ?   we hope this will be our last hard lesson,? said Sheikh Talib   the head of Falluja?s local council, who has promised returnees that help is on the way. Mr. Efan spoke in a cold, darkened room, within a building he said had been used as an Islamic State headquarters and was now the council?s makeshift office. The electricity sputtered on and off. Mr. Efan is a returnee himself. His three homes  ?   one for each wife  ?   were destroyed during the Islamic State occupation, he said. He has lived at a friend?s house since returning in August. ?People have to expect delays,? he said. ?They need to be patient. ? The United Nations Development Program said it had made stopgap repairs to the city?s main teaching hospital and to five schools and health centers. The agency has restored rudimentary electricity and water in many areas, cleared debris and hired 300 locals to clean streets. Lise Grande, the United Nations deputy special representative in Iraq, said the agency?s stabilization work was to help patch up Falluja until more permanent repairs could be made. The agency has spent $8. 6 million of $18. 5 million allocated  ?   a small fraction of the amount needed to rebuild the city. Mr. Ajmi, the councilman, said the council had little funding. Depressed oil prices have kept Iraq?s economy floundering. Life is precarious everywhere, he said, not just in Falluja. Hussein Ahmed, 53, who lived in a   camp for three years, said he had lost patience with the council. He returned to Falluja to find his house wrecked  ?   the third he has lost. Two previous homes were destroyed during battles against fighters for Al Qaeda in Iraq, he said. ?We were hurt badly by Daesh,? he said, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State. ?And now we?re being hurt by our own government. ? Mr. Ahmed pointed to an expanse of toppled buildings: ?This area was liberated in June, and it still looks the same now. ? Other returning residents nodded as Mr. Ahmed added, ?I speak for thousands of people when I say the government has forgotten us. ? Falluja has endured tragedy on an epic scale since 2003. The city was pounded during repeated battles  ?   first between the United States and Saddam Hussein?s forces in 2003, then between American Marines and Al Qaeda fighters. Most insurgents were eventually evicted with the help of Sunni tribal fighters. But the insurgency was reborn as the Islamic State. It overran Falluja in December 2013, and the city became an important base for the group?s operations. One reason the government assaulted the city last May, even before turning to the critical campaign for Mosul, to the north, was to curb a devastating car bomb campaign against Baghdad that was being operated from Falluja. Now, the United States military is working with Iraqi forces to prevent Islamic State fighters from rising up in Falluja again, said a spokesman, Col. John L. Dorrian. ?They have proved very resilient,? he said. Falluja is hardly the government?s only worry in a nation with 3. 1 million internally displaced people. The government is pouring resources into the Mosul battle while also trying to rebuild Falluja and Ramadi, in Anbar Province, and to repair the city of Tikrit, farther north. Of the 320, 000 people who fled Falluja for aid camps, about 250, 000 have returned since   the United Nations said. They are desperate to live at home again, whatever the risk. In south Falluja, First Lt. Walid Mohammed of the police shook his head as Mr. Rashid and his children tended their campfire. ?We told them the risk is all theirs,? he said. ?They are responsible if anything happens, not us. ? Elisabeth Koek, of the Norwegian Refugee Council in Iraq, said about letting residents return to dangerous areas deprived of public services: ?This is incredibly worrying. ? Mr. Rashid said he returned even after a   killed a returnee in a supposedly cleared area nearby. After Mr. Rashid moved in, a woman was killed by an explosion on Jan. 31 as she was repairing her home in the same area, police said. Mr. Rashid said he was accustomed to danger. He lifted his shirt to reveal jagged, crimson scars on his belly from an Islamic State bomb that he said blew up the family car in late 2013. The blackened front seat lay in the front yard. A tall,   man suddenly appeared: Mohammed Saeed, 49, a neighbor whom Mr. Rashid had not seen since 2013. Mr. Saed had returned that morning, three years after fleeing. His home was dirty and bereft of electricity or water. But he was moving in. Mr. Saed kissed Mr. Rashid on both cheeks. ?I?m so happy,? he told him. ?It?s a dangerous, terrible place, but we are home. ?"
17764,Choe Sang-Hun,11/03/2017,2017,3,business,"SEOUL, South Korea  ?   A South Korean court on Thursday blocked a prosecutor?s attempt to arrest Jay Y. Lee, the leader of Samsung, saying there was not enough evidence that Mr. Lee had bribed President Park   in a scandal that led to her impeachment. A justice on the Central District Court in Seoul, Cho   rejected the prosecutor?s request to issue an arrest warrant, saying said it was ?difficult to recognize the need? to incarcerate Mr. Lee. Mr. Lee, a   scion and vice chairman of Samsung, one of the world?s biggest conglomerates, was immediately released from a detention center outside Seoul, where he had been waiting for the court to decide whether he should be formally arrested. South Koreans have paid keen attention to the fate of Mr. Lee. Some analysts said his case was a test of whether the country?s relatively youthful democracy and judicial system are ready to crack down on the   crimes of   conglomerates. No Samsung leader has ever been jailed, though the company has been investigated many times for corruption. The court?s decision is likely to anger many South Koreans who have held weekend rallies calling for Ms. Park?s ouster and the arrest of business tycoons on corruption charges. The special prosecutor called the court decision ?very regrettable. ? But he has yet to announce whether he will offer more evidence in a renewed effort to have Mr. Lee arrested. He can also indict Mr. Lee on bribery or lesser charges without arresting him. ?We will take necessary steps and persist in our investigation without wavering,? said Lee   a spokesman for the special prosecutor, without elaborating. Samsung welcomed the court?s decision. For now, the ruling allows Mr. Lee to continue to lead Samsung. It dealt a blow to the special prosecutor who had tried to build a bribery case against Mr. Lee and Ms. Park. Mr. Lee?s father has twice been convicted of bribery and tax evasion but has never spent a day in prison. Each time, he received a presidential pardon and returned to management. Mr. Lee, 48, was accused of paying $36 million to Ms. Park?s secretive confidante, Choi  . The special prosecutor and Mr. Lee?s lawyers have been arguing over how to characterize the money. In November, state prosecutors indicted Ms. Choi on extortion charges, saying she leveraged her connections with Ms. Park to coerce Samsung and scores of other big businesses to contribute tens of millions of dollars to two foundations Ms. Choi controlled or to companies run by her or her associates. They identified Ms. Park as an accomplice, but they brought no charges against the businesses, which they saw as victims of extortion. But the special prosecutor, Park   who took over the investigation from state prosecutors last month, has called Samsung?s contributions bribes that were exchanged for political favors from Ms. Park. That includes government support for a merger of two Samsung affiliates in 2015, which helped Mr. Lee inherit corporate control from his incapacitated father, the chairman, Lee   according to the prosecutor.   groups accused the prosecutor of overreaching in an attempt to find a   scapegoat to soothe a public infuriated over Ms. Park?s corruption scandal and fed up with decades of collusive ties between the government and the chaebol. Mr. Lee was the most prominent businessman to be ensnared in the special prosecutor?s broadening investigation into the corruption scandal that led to Ms. Park?s impeachment by Parliament last month. Ms. Park?s presidential powers remained suspended, while the Constitutional Court is expected to rule in coming weeks whether she should be reinstated or formally removed from office. ?We have been too lenient toward chaebol corruption,? said Moon   an opposition politician who leads in polls on contenders to replace Ms. Park if she is removed. Speaking to a group of foreign reporters hours before the court?s decision, Mr. Moon said Samsung was typical of a chaebol whose top boss wielded ?imperial powers? over his sprawling business group but was ?seldom held accountable? for corruption or managerial failures. Ms. Park denies any wrongdoing. Mr. Lee and Samsung have also denied bribery they argued that the ?donations? Samsung paid out to Ms. Choi were coerced, not meant as a quid pro quo for political favors from Ms. Park."
18408,Ruth La Ferla,8/02/2017,2017,2,entertainment,"Was it just a year ago that Katie Holmes, Jennifer Hudson and Lucy Liu snatched up most of the light and much of the air at Zac Posen?s fall show? A scant six months later, Mr. Posen was host to a somewhat less lustrous contingent, one that included Malin Akerman, Kelly Bensimon and Olivia Culpo. (Who?) Last February, Claire Danes, Laura Linney and Amy Schumer lent their aggregate star power to Narciso Rodriguez?s show. By September, the designer?s paparazzi bait was confined to a lineup highlighted by Jessica Alba and Jessica Seinfeld. So it went. And now, on the eve of another round of New York shows, it seems safe to predict a similar thinning of celebrity ranks, as top film and music personalities disappear from their gilded   perches, their dwindling presence matched only, some say, by their diminishing impact. ?You can still expect to see certain celebrities in the front row,? said Tommy Hilfiger, who began trumpeting his alignment with entertainment world players as far back as the 1980s. But these days, Mr. Hilfiger suggested, designers and major Seventh Avenue brands need to rethink their marketing strategies. In itself, he said, ?a star?s presence does nothing to move the needle. ? That realization, somewhat slow to dawn in fashion circles, accounts in part for a perceptible drop in celebrity attendance. ?In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the shows were really ? said Billy Farrell, who heads BFA, an events photography agency. ?As a house photographer, I used to get a long list of faces. Now at any given show, one or a maximum of five celebrities are guaranteed to go backstage or sit in the front row wearing the designer clothes. ? That paucity of   personalities is ascribed to a string of factors: celebrity overexposure, a generalized fashion fatigue and, chief among them, shrinking fashion budgets. ?People don?t have as much money as they used to, and they?re scared,? said Kelly Cutrone, a fashion publicist. Aware that the payoff may be negligible, many designers are reluctant to part with the thousands, or tens of thousands, of dollars in an effort to ensure the presence of, say, a Jessica Chastain, a Julianne Moore or, for that matter, a Lady Gaga, pop culture luminaries who, once they arrive, may or may not deign to speak to the press. For designers, the topic is a touchy one. Among those who declined to comment were Georgina Chapman and Keren Craig of Marchesa, Carolina Herrera, Marc Jacobs, Mr. Rodriguez, Jeremy Scott, Diane von Furstenberg, Alexander Wang and Vera Wang. But publicists and others strategizing behind the scenes were more voluble, citing, among other causes, a certain jadedness among consumers. ?People can tell it?s a paid front row,? Ms. Cutrone said. ?Does anyone really believe that Drew Barrymore and Diane Kruger are going to Seven jeans because they like Seven jeans?? More troubling, still, is the widening view that fashion itself is losing much of its vaunted cachet. ?The shows are not cool anymore,? said Teri Agins, the author of the 2014 book ?Hijacking the Runway: How Celebrities Are Stealing the Spotlight From Fashion Designers,? which chronicles the evolution of the celebrity front row. European houses may still attract stars of a certain caliber, Ms. Agins noted, some drawn by Europe?s cachet, others compelled by   cosmetic and marketing contracts. But in New York, she said, ?the novelty is gone. ? Oversaturation has played a role. In recent years, invitations were issued, vetted and approved by teams of publicists, Hollywood agents,   stylists and, as often as not, the stars themselves, many of whom are snapped each season hopscotching from show to show, their influence diluted by their ubiquity. ?We sort of cooked our golden goose,? said James LaForce, a veteran fashion publicist. ?At the end of the day, all their pictures seemed to run together. ? ?We?re at the end of that cycle now,? he added. ?It feels   something from another era. ? By most accounts, that era dawned in the early to   when the shows, once scattered in showrooms, galleries and ballrooms all over town, were brought together under the tents at Bryant Park. At the time designer front rows were judiciously seeded with ?friends of the house,? among them society figures, and the occasional television personality, Broadway ing?nue or authentic megastar. ?They were people we dressed, people I often had dinner with, people whose children we knew and sometimes dressed,? the designer Dennis Basso said. At Mr. Basso?s fashion extravaganzas over the years, Diane Sawyer might have been seen rubbing shoulders with Ivana Trump, Martha Stewart spied sitting flank to flank alongside Mary J. Blige. ?The celebrity front row was a form of preshow entertainment,? Mr. Basso recalled. It generated the kind of frisson that a parade of clothes might not in itself provide. In that seemingly innocent era, shows were   trade events, largely the province of store buyers, journalists and a smattering of   ladies who lunched. That picture altered in the   when Uma Thurman wore a   Prada dress to the Oscars. ?It was a sort of milestone,? said Simon Doonan, the creative ambassador for Barneys New York, ?a sign that it was groovy for a designer to dress a celebrity. ? So groovy, in fact, that before long the celebrity front row went from a mildly provocative attraction to fashion?s main event, transforming, as Ms. Agins writes, ?what was once a clubby ritual for fashion insiders into a multiplatform extravaganza showcased in print, on TV and everywhere on the internet. ? In those heady days, she observed, the front row itself became part of the content of fashion show. Today, some argue, that content is debased. ?What constitutes a celebrity now has changed,? said Fern Mallis, a fashion consultant and the former executive director of the Council of Fashion Designers of America. ?It?s no longer necessarily that   Hollywood diva. ? The diva, it seems, has ceded her power to models and social media megastars like Gigi Hadid, Kylie Jenner and Irina Shayk, pop idols who bring to the table a large internet following but lack the gravitas of Ms. Chastain and her rarefied peers. ?The rise of celebrity bloggers, reality stars and others who are famous simply for being famous turns a lot of people off,? said Leslie Sloane, a prominent Hollywood publicist. ?Those girls may be lovely, but they?re not fashion. ? Just as   is the tendency of those who do turn up to stay mum. Lady Gaga appeared last season at the show of Brandon Maxwell, her    posing gamely for photographers but turning away reporters. Also taking no interviews were Ms. Holmes at Zac Posen, and Zo? Kravitz and Ms. Jenner at Alexander Wang, whose show in September was one of the few that attracted marquee names like Madonna and her daughter Lourdes. That kind of drawing power does not come cheap. Hard figures are elusive, but insiders estimate that fees for attendance can range from $25, 000 to more than $100, 000. In the   practice known industrywide as    an   attraction like Angelina Jolie could command close to $1 million, Mr. Hilfiger said. Such sums, which vary according to a celebrity?s clout, are expected to cover the cost of   airfare and hotel accommodations, as well as wardrobe, hair, makeup and other amenities. They are   numbers, for sure. But just two or three years ago, they were routinely factored into many designers? marketing budgets. In distributing funds, Mr. LaForce said, ?we would game the situation. ? It was a little like a commodities market, sums parceled out ?based on who was available and who would take what,? he said, adding, ?Still, in the end we would say it was absolutely worth it. ? For some designers, it still is. ?To have celebrities appear in our clothes adds a sense of heightened reality,? said Michael Kors, whose celebrity turnout last season included Emily Blunt Cynthia Erivo, the   winning Broadway star and Sienna Miller. ?You see the clothes on the runway, then you see our clothes from the last show on the celebrities in the front row, and you get it. The message has come full circle. ? No one would argue that the fame game is entirely played out. But for some designers, attention has shifted from actors and musicians to other kinds of pop stars. ?A handful of supermodels out there have enormous social media followings, Gigi Hadid being the leader,? Mr. Hilfiger said. ?She?s the girl next door with an exotic twist. ? (Ms. Hadid?s mother is Dutch her father is Palestinian.) Mr. Hilfiger was prompt to exploit Ms. Hadid?s growing global appeal, enlisting her to walk his runway, appear in his advertising campaigns and design a capsule collection of her own. The success of those moves was measurable, he said, in 2. 2 million social media impressions, a 900 percent increase in total   over the previous year, and tens of millions in sales of the Hadid line. Plenty of people were impressed, among them designers of an altogether different ilk. ?We understand the power involved in that alignment we won?t pretend that we don?t,? said Ryan Lobo, who, with Ramon Martin, designs Tome, a collection aimed largely at a haute bohemian clientele. Mr. Lobo and Mr. Martin, however, prefer a nuanced approach that takes celebrity marketing back to its roots. At their shows they tend to seat loyalists, prominent clients like the artists Shirin Neshat and Kara Walker, alongside such    personalities as Sandra Bernhard. ?We aim to make the mix intriguing,? Mr. Lobo said, ?like a dinner party with people who don?t normally have access to each other. ? Picking up the analogy, Mr. Martin added: ?These people are our personal icons, and there will be others. You know we?re always going to add a chair to the end of the table. ?"
17887,"Charlie Savage, Eric Lipton, Gardiner Harris and Michael D. Shear",24/01/2017,2017,1,business,"? The federal taxpayer will be defending President Trump in a lawsuit filed against his business ownership. ? Mr. Trump?s new hotel in Washington lost money in its opening months. ? Two major donors to the Trump election effort will get plum ambassadorships. The Justice Department will defend President Trump from a new lawsuit that accuses him of violating the Constitution by allowing his hotels and business operations to accept payments from foreign governments, officials said on Monday. But while Mr. Trump said on Monday that the case was ?without merit,? a Justice Department spokeswoman, Nicole Navas, declined to comment on it, saying only, ?The department is reviewing the complaint and will respond as appropriate. ? The lawsuit, assigned on Monday to Judge Ronnie Abrams, an appointee of President Barack Obama, centers on the Constitution?s ?emoluments? clause, which bars federal officeholders from accepting gifts or payments from foreign governments. Before his inauguration, lawyers hired by Mr. Trump argued that the clause ?does not forbid    transactions with foreign officials,? like paying for hotel rooms. They also said Mr. Trump would donate profits from foreign governments? patronage to the United States Treasury. But the lawsuit, filed by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a liberal government corruption watchdog, contends that the clause bars such transactions, too, and that donating profits does not solve the problem. It wants the judge to stop Mr. Trump?s businesses from accepting such payments. It is not clear that Judge Abrams will resolve the dispute over the clause?s meaning. First, she must decide whether the group has suffered enough injury to bring a court challenge. The group argued that it had standing to sue because keeping track of foreign payments to Mr. Trump?s businesses imposed a ?significant diversion and depletion of its time, resources and effort. ? It cited a 1982 housing discrimination case as precedent for the idea that an advocacy organization can sue over conduct that drains its resources. But several scholars on Monday noted that Congress had enacted a statute that made it easier to challenge housing discrimination, but not emoluments clause violations. Josh Blackman, a conservative law professor at South Texas College of Law Houston, argued in a lengthy blog entry that a ? ? injury  ?   like choosing to track certain conduct  ?   is generally not sufficient to establish court standing. The Trump International Hotel in Washington took in far less revenue in its first two months than it had projected in estimates it had provided to the General Services Administration, which owns the building, meaning that the hotel lost more than $1. 1 million in September and October, according to a letter that House Democrats released on Monday. The revenue totals, and estimates of expected revenue, were released as the four House Democrats pressed the General Services Administration to explain how it would respond to the apparent breach that has taken place in the lease Mr. Trump has with the agency, given that it contains a clause that appears to prohibit federal elected officials from benefiting from the lease. The Trump Hotel, which opened in September, had estimated that it would generate $6. 4 million in revenue in its first two months, but it collected just $4. 1 million, according to the letter, citing information that Mr. Trump?s company provided to the agency as part of the lease agreement. The hotel had expected about $397, 000 in income through the end of October  ?   revenue minus expenses  ?   but actually had $1. 16 million in losses. These losses came as the hotel was just opening, a challenging time for any new hotel. And revenues have clearly surged after Mr. Trump was elected and in the time around the inauguration. The House Democrats, led by Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, the ranking member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, asked the General Services Administration to explain what action, if any, it plans to take regarding the hotel lease, given the provision that appears to bar a federal elected official from holding it. The agency has so far made no public statement on how it will respond to this apparent breach. The Democrats also released a chart showing the corporate ownership arrangement behind the Trump Post Office LLC, the corporate entity set up by the Trump family to run the hotel. It shows that Mr. Trump, at least at the time he submitted the filing to the General Services Administration, controlled 76 percent of the company, while three of his children each had about 7. 5 percent. A representative from the Trump Organization did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Trump is expected to nominate two private equity executives and major campaign   to the plum diplomatic posts of Italy and Japan. Lewis M. Eisenberg has been chosen to be ambassador to Italy, and William F. Hagerty IV will be nominated to become ambassador to Japan, according to senior White House advisers. Mr. Eisenberg began his career at Goldman Sachs and then   Granite Capital International Group. He was the chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey at the time of the Sept. 11 attacks and has long served in top positions in Republican   circles. He led a joint   effort by the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee and served on Mr. Trump?s Presidential Inaugural Committee. Mr. Hagerty served as an economic adviser during the administration of President George Bush and then built a career in private equity. He was Mitt Romney?s national finance chairman in 2008 and supported former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida in the presidential campaign until Mr. Trump clinched the Republican nomination. He later became director of appointments for the Trump transition team. Early in his career, Mr. Hagerty lived in Japan for three years. Ambassadorships to Italy and Japan are normally considered safe places for     since both countries are allies. But relations with both could prove challenging in the coming years as Italy faces crucial national elections and Japan recovers from Mr. Trump?s cancellation of the   Partnership, a top Japanese priority. Sean Spicer, the new White House press secretary, opened his first full daily briefing with a quick joke about his lack of popularity among the press corps and a break with precedent: The first questions went to friendly outlets, not the wire services. After a very contentious exchange with reporters over the weekend, which drew angry condemnation on social media, Mr. Spicer noted that he had sent an email to Josh Earnest, his Democratic predecessor, who had been voted the most popular press secretary among reporters. ?He can rest easy. His title is secure, at least for the next few days,? Mr. Spicer joked. Mr. Spicer largely ignored the longstanding precedent of calling on the wire services, network reporters and major news organizations. Instead, he called on The New York Post first, then the Christian Broadcasting Network. ?Our intention is not to lie to you,? he told reporters, after a shaky start this weekend when he inflated the number of people at the president?s inauguration. Mr. Trump issued a fresh tax warning to corporate America on Monday morning, promising that his administration would introduce a ?substantial? border tax that would make it expensive for businesses to move factories outside the country. ?A company that wants to fire all of its people in the United States and build some factory someplace else, then thinks that product is going to just flow across the border into the United States,? Mr. Trump said  ?   ?that?s just not going to happen. ? How such a tax would work is in question. Would a company like General Motors that already has a plant in Mexico be hit by the tax, or would it affect only companies that move operations overseas once the law passes? What about Apple, which has contracts with manufacturers in China but doesn?t manufacture there itself? Mr. Trump, who plans to withdraw the United States from the   Partnership trade agreement, rejected the notion that he was   but insisted that his first priority as president is to put American workers first on such deals. ?What we want is fair trade? Mr. Trump said. ?We?re going to treat countries fairly, but they have to treat us fairly. ? Trying to ease concerns among American business executives about a border tax, Mr. Trump said that the solution was easy: Stay in the United States. ?If you stay here, there?s no tax,? he said. ?All you have to do is stay. ? Julia Hahn, a young writer for the website Breitbart, is expected to join the White House as an aide working with her former boss, Mr. Bannon, the president?s chief strategist. Ms. Hahn?s exact title and duties are unclear, although one White House official, who was not authorized to speak publicly because Ms. Hahn has not yet been formally hired, said that there were a number of   positions open and she would slide into one. But Ms. Hahn wrote several Breitbart articles savaging House Speaker Paul D. Ryan over his past support for comprehensive immigration reform and his criticism of Mr. Trump during the campaign. ?He?s With Her: Inside Paul Ryan?s   Campaign to Elect Hillary Clinton President,? blared the headline on one piece in October. During the transition period, Mr. Ryan and Mr. Bannon, who was the chairman of Breitbart, are said to have begun to develop a relationship. And aides to Mr. Ryan came away from a meeting on tax reform with Mr. Bannon and other senior advisers to the president describing Mr. Bannon as the only one with a nuanced understanding of policy. Ms. Hahn would represent an expansion of Mr. Bannon?s growing sway within the White House, as he aligns with the president?s    and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, to develop a governing philosophy for the new administration. In the 2016 election cycle, Sheldon Adelson, the megadonor and casino magnate, was the nearly $125 million man. Mr. Adelson had a prime seat at Mr. Trump?s swearing in on the West Front of the Capitol last week. And at a dinner honoring Vice President Mike Pence, the president singled out Mr. Adelson in the crowd. He mocked him for having been late to donate but also said that the total amount he gave to ?super PACs? was roughly $125 million. Two people close to Mr. Adelson described that figure as accurate. Mr. Trump, in his remarks, went on to criticize super PACs and to describe them as vehicles for consultants to get rich. Mr. Adelson is said to have donated through several vehicles, including to groups supporting congressional Republicans. Still, Mr. Adelson?s largess was consequential to Mr. Trump during the campaign. He was one of the earliest donors to support Mr. Trump, a fellow casino developer, once it became clear he would be the nominee. During difficult stretches toward the end Mr. Trump?s race, when Mr. Adelson was pushed to donate more cash, he expressed concern about doing so unless Mr. Trump gave more of his own money to the campaign, according to two people briefed on those discussions. Mr. Adelson?s singular focus is the safety of Israel, and one of his concerns is that the administration follow through with a vow to move the United States Embassy to Jerusalem. Before his rise to Mr. Trump?s White House, Sean Spicer, the press secretary, was known around Washington as the somewhat beleaguered communications chief at the Republican National Committee, and before that, a spokesman around Republican quarters of the House. But his brushes with the news media  ?   and ensuing raw feelings  ?   go further back than that, to his school days at Connecticut College, where he was a student government senator and his relationship with The College Voice was, shall we say, not terribly cordial. He may have even coined the meme ?Sad!? It started in April 1993, when The College Voice?s ?This Week in Assembly? column detailed an amendment to ensure that an antismoking regulation would not affect existing rules for the creation of smoking and nonsmoking rooms for exams, sponsored by one ?Sean Sphincter. ? That May, The College Voice allowed that Mr. Spicer was ?unintentionally misidentified? and that the paper ?regrets the error. ? This did not satisfy Mr. Spicer, who dashed off an angry letter to the editor about the article ?in which my name was ?misspelled. ?? ?While those involved claimed that this was a copy joke that went unnoticed, I believe that it was a malicious and intentional attack. For a paper which claims to be run by ?professional? standards, I find it a bit sad that this type of reporting is explained as a simple part of production. ? The White House press secretary?s emphatic insistence that 1. 5 million people attended Mr. Trump?s inauguration has become quite the national punch line. The Dallas Stars got into the act: So did this guy: Even Steve Kerr, the coach of the Golden State Warriors and former pro player, was having fun with it. Mr. Trump announced that he will nominate former Representative Heather Wilson as secretary of the Air Force, making her the first graduate of the Air Force Academy to serve in the role. Ms. Wilson, a Republican, represented New Mexico in the House from 1998 to 2009 but lost two races for the Senate. Since 2013, she has served as president of the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology. Her name had been floated for other administration positions, including director of national intelligence. The new president is still on Twitter, naturally, but he apparently hasn?t decided where his followers are to look. On his old @realDonaldTrump feed on Monday morning, he offered up a little bit of news for the day ahead. The @POTUS account, intermittently used by President Barack Obama and usually a tad dull, has become a propaganda arm of the Trump White House, with exaltations, quotations and photographs  ?   and a profile pic of the new president that is pure Trump. The White House did move the president?s initial @realDonaldTrump post on Monday morning to the official account, 23 minutes later. Perhaps his advisers can nudge him away from a personal account that technically he shouldn?t be using, according to the same rules that he cited when he blasted Hillary Clinton for her personal email server. A longer look at his daily schedule is here: Separately, Mr. Trump?s    opposition is pushing #MuteMonday, encouraging people to unfollow @realDonaldTrump and @POTUS, find a new leader to follow and share their choice. The bipartisan leadership of the House and Senate are scheduled to go to the White House on Monday for what is billed as a casual reception with Mr. Trump. At the inaugural luncheon after Mr. Trump?s   on Friday, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, spent a good 15 minutes yakking with Mr. Trump, apparently to express displeasure with the president?s cabinet nominees, in particular Representative Tom Price of Georgia, the nominee to be secretary of health and human services. The session will be the president?s first extended opportunity to look for common ground with Democrats, who have denounced his messages and policy priorities, including his executive order on Saturday to pave the way for weakening the requirements of the Affordable Care Act. He will also have a chance to discuss potential bipartisan initiatives, including his $1 trillion infrastructure spending plan. Mr. Trump has high hopes for his relationship with Capitol Hill. He declared on Friday, just minutes after being sworn in, that ?we all want the same thing,? regardless of political party, and, ?we?re going to get along. ? Monday?s   gathering will be a first test. Mr. Schumer is slated to be at the Monday meeting with Senators Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican Mr. Ryan and Representatives Kevin McCarthy of California, the majority leader, Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader, and Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the minority whip. Notably, Mr. Trump is set to meet alone with Mr. Ryan afterward. Nominees are likely to be only one of the topics. Mr. Tillerson appears likely to win Senate confirmation, close relationship with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and all. But senators are still wary of the Russia connections. Mr. Schumer and Senator Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, are introducing legislation that would require a congressional vote to lift the sanctions that were imposed on Russia after its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and proxy war in that former Soviet state. The two senators will emphasize that the legislation will also cover sanctions imposed just weeks ago by Mr. Obama after intelligence agencies concluded that Russia had interfered with the 2016 election in hopes of helping elect Mr. Trump. The measure, modeled after a law that required a congressional vote on the Iran nuclear deal, is expected to have bipartisan support, as that legislation did."
17757,Katie Rogers and Gia Kourlas,10/02/2017,2017,2,politics,"Like hundreds of young dancers before her, Phoebe Pearl dropped everything to become a Rockette. Ms. Pearl was 19 when she quit the Boston Conservatory in 2009 to join the elite group of dancers  ?   strong, athletic and poised  ?   who are as emblematic of New York City as the Empire State Building and the yellow taxi cab. For eight years, she was proud to be a Rockette, and the company treated her well, with generous pay and health insurance. But in   when management announced that the dancers would perform at the inauguration of Donald J. Trump, Ms. Pearl did something that a Rockette is never supposed to do. She stepped out of line, breaking with the silent, smiling solidarity that defines the    institution, to denounce the idea of celebrating a man with a   history of objectifying women. In a rare collision of presidential politics and a venerable arts organization, current and former Rockettes find themselves in a new kind of spotlight  ?   a position both painful and empowering  ?   as they take sides over the inauguration, a split illustrating the cultural divide that   Trump has cleaved through the country. ?We are a group of women that is encouraging young girls to be strong, independent women, to fulfill their dreams, to go for it,? Ms. Pearl, 27, said in her first interview since the inaugural uproar began. ?It?s about women?s rights. ? But Patty DeCarlo Grantham, the president of the Rockette Alumnae Association, which has about 550 members, said that many of them are upset about the furor and support the Rockettes performing at the inauguration, as they did in 2001 and 2005. ?So many people wrote to me and said, ?I feel so ashamed about what?s going on,?? said Ms. Grantham, 76. ?We feel like it?s a great honor to be asked to dance. ? Best known as a Christmastime tourist attraction at Radio City Music Hall, the Rockettes are also regarded in artistic circles as some of the finest dancers in New York City. But the controversy has reignited sensitivities within the corps that they are seen as beauty pageant contestants more than skilled performers and that they are easy to lampoon. On last weekend?s episode of ?Saturday Night Live,? Alec Baldwin, portraying Mr. Trump, said of the inauguration lineup, ?Best of all, we?ve got the one Rockette with the least money in her savings. ? Dottie   a    former Rockette, said, ?Here you have the most sophisticated women that are so well respected in this country. ? She added, ?To put them on the same stage as this man, to me, is reprehensible. ? The individual Rockettes had no say in the inauguration booking: It was ultimately the decision of James L. Dolan, the executive chairman of the Madison Square Garden Company, which manages the Rockettes. Mr. Dolan is a longtime friend of Mr. Trump and donated to his campaign he has supported both Democrats and Republicans in the past. A company spokesman, Barry Watkins, declined requests for interviews with Mr. Dolan and current leaders and members of the Rockettes. Mr. Watkins, in response to written questions about the Rockettes as well as the inauguration performance, wrote by email, ?The New York Times has had an   Trump agenda for quite some time and now the Rockettes are on the receiving end of their bias. ? This article is based on interviews over the last three weeks with Ms. Pearl, who was a Rockette until this month, and nine former Rockettes, as well as others in the extended Rockette organization. Several people spoke anonymously for fear that if they were to speak publicly, the Madison Square Garden Company would take legal action against them. The backlash over the inauguration performance began on Twitter and Facebook after Ms. Pearl wrote a private Instagram post. ?I am speaking for just myself, but please know that after we found out this news, we have been performing with tears in our eyes and heavy hearts,? Ms. Pearl wrote. She believes a friend of hers shared her photo with the celebrity gossip blog Perez Hilton. She and her fellow performers would later learn that their performance at the inauguration would not be mandatory, as some feared, but it was too late to stop criticism from strangers who took to social media to tell her to shut up and dance. Supporters wondered whether she and her fellow dancers were under a gag order. A news crew, Ms. Pearl said, showed up at her Harlem apartment. That sort of attention came as a shock within the world of the Rockettes, which is devoted to a particular kind of   synchronicity, where no one person dominates the stage. A Radio City Rockette is a specialist in precision dance technique, a rare, regimented and intricate style that requires both athleticism and artistry. Rockettes must stand between    and       and uphold a standard of elegance, along with an expertise in tap, modern dance, jazz and ballet. They must hit positions with military exactitude. It?s a style that requires a dancer to step into a line  ?   not to take over and not to be left behind. It takes fortitude and humility. ?You don?t realize how much individuality you have as a dancer until you?re asked to dance like 35 other women,? said Jessica McRoberts, 39, a former Rockette. ?Things down to your pinkie finger. ? Under the leadership of Linda Haberman, who began directing and choreographing touring productions of the ?Christmas Spectacular? in 1993, the Rockettes gained artistic respect and became modernized with more challenging choreography. Ms. Haberman left the organization in 2014 and declined a request for comment. Despite requests, the Madison Square Garden Company did not make the troupe?s current director, Karen Keeler, available for interviews. The rigors of performing and traveling as a company often allow dancers to form close and lasting bonds, according to Ms. Grantham, the alumnae president, who was a Rockette from 1959 until 1970. Ms. Grantham said that the Rockettes have a long history of performing for presidents and at events in New York City hosted by both Republicans and Democrats. ?One time we did benefits for both parties in one night,? she said. ?One was at the Sheraton, and the other was at the Hilton. ? This wouldn?t be the first time the Rockettes performed for a controversial president, but the volatile media climate surrounding Mr. Trump?s inauguration is unusual. Rhonda Malkin, a former Rockette who worked as a personal trainer to Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner for two years, said that the Trump and Kushner families were supportive of her career as a Rockette. Once, they attended a performance to see her dance. ?I think they would like to see the Rockettes perform at the inauguration,? she said of the Trump family. ?Whether or not that causes a rift throughout the brand is yet to be seen. ? Ms. Malkin, 38, said that several of the current Rockettes she knows are upset that a crew of 13   Rockettes were initially told by their union, the American Guild of Variety Artists, that they would be forced to perform. ?There are some career Rockettes who are very upset about this,? Ms. Malkin said of the inauguration plans. ?I?ve also heard the women of color are very upset. From what I have heard, it has just caused a real rift in the company. ? Ms. Malkin, who was a Rockette for 12 years, said Ms. Pearl ?took a real risk? for speaking out, but she doubts that the controversy surrounding the inauguration has caused any lasting damage to the brand. ?I would honestly say that the majority of our audience members are white Christian conservative people,? Ms. Malkin said. ?And those folks probably supported Trump. ? Of Mr. Dolan, the Madison Square Garden chairman, she added, ?He knows those are the people who buy tickets to those shows. ? While the Rockettes are an American symbol  ?   as much as Radio City Music Hall or Mr. Trump and his branded buildings  ?   the group?s individual dancers remain fairly anonymous. They don?t speak unless deemed   by the Madison Square Garden Company, which has fiercely protected them against criticism surrounding the inauguration. ?For a while we weren?t allowed to say, ?I?m going to be on the ?Today? show with the Rockettes tomorrow morning,?? said Naomi Kakuk, 40, a former Rockette. ?You?d say: ?Watch the ?Today? show tomorrow  ?   you might see a familiar face.? We couldn?t even say we were on a show that was promoting the show. ? Mr. Dolan has been criticized for making the inauguration deal and guarding the Rockettes from media requests, but several former dancers praised his management style, which include generous benefits. Being a Rockette is among the most lucrative jobs a dancer can get in New York, complete with   health insurance even though the company performs on a seasonal basis. Ms. Kakuk, who loved her time as a Rockette, said, ?You get six months of pay for three months of work, and it is six months? worth of work in three months because it?s so incredibly intense. ? She added that some of the dancers live in New York during the Christmas show and then go home to Wisconsin or Florida to teach. ?You have insurance for the year, you have a great paycheck, you do all these fun gigs and side things, and you?re doing the show and dancing on the great stage,? Ms. Kakuk said. ?You?re skinny as hell when you get out. You?re bikini ready in January. It?s amazing. ? Cheryl Cutlip, who danced as a Rockette for 15 years and left the company in 2008, said that benefits were ushered in quickly after the TV company Cablevision bought Radio City Music Hall in 1997. Ms. Cutlip, 45, remembered Mr. Dolan meeting with the Rockettes to go over their basic needs. She said he gave them his personal email address. Soon, Rockettes no longer had to rush out of the door to find coffee and a bagel in the   space between performance preparations. ?He started bringing food in,? Ms. Cutlip said of Mr. Dolan. ?Once he saw the practical needs of the Rockettes, he started meeting them. ? For other former Rockettes, the current controversy reminded them of clashes between the dancers, their union and their corporate employer. Lora Pavilack, a former Rockette, said she had been locked out of the building twice, once for talking to the news media and, another time, during contentious negotiations over a union contract. ?That?s the culture,? she said, ?and that?s why they?ve lined up with the  . ? Ms. Malkin said that she was also locked out with Ms. Pavilack during contract negotiations in 2005. Madison Square Garden officials declined to comment for this article, but they have said in the past that no one had been locked out during contract negotiations. More than enough Rockettes wanted to perform at the inaugural, but Ms. Kakuk also knows some who are not participating. ?I think some of them are done anyway,? she said, ?and they were like, ?This is the last straw, I?m out. ?? Ms. Pearl is one of them. On a recent evening, she ended weeks of silence by taking part in a toast to the First Amendment presented by the Bessies, or the New York Dance and Performance Awards. ?People have been calling me courageous,? Ms. Pearl said at the toast, her voice cracking. ?But I don?t see it that way. I?m just standing up for human rights. ? Many in the dance world, including Yvonne Rainer, the postmodern giant who was part of the toast, and several former Rockettes, including Ms. Kakuk, have voiced enthusiasm for Ms. Pearl?s action and her talent as a dancer. ?When you see her onstage as a Rockette, you watch her,? Ms. Kakuk said. ?She?s outspoken but less so than others. It was a bit of a surprise. ? With the latest holiday season behind her, Ms. Pearl has decided to leave the organization and forge a path in film and television. She found inspiration in the actress Meryl Streep, who spoke out against Mr. Trump at the Golden Globes. ?She can speak freely,? Ms. Pearl said. ?I wish to have the opportunity to speak as freely as I can, without any repercussion. ? But stepping out of the line is just not the Rockettes? way. ?Usually artists are more outspoken,? Ms. Kakuk said, ?but Rockettes as a brand is not very outspoken. You work for a giant corporation, and a lot of girls don?t realize that. They just think they?re dancing. ?"
17295,Maggie Haberman,2/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.  ?   When   Donald J. Trump rang in the new year this weekend, he did it in   opulence, joined by the actor Sylvester Stallone, the gossip page fixture Fabio and a crowd of wealthy developers reveling under the swaying palm trees at Mr. Trump?s    resort in Palm Beach. President George W. Bush had his ranch in Crawford, Tex. His father had a compound in Kennebunkport, Me. President Obama has taken frequent vacations in Hawaii, staying at a private home. But Mr. Trump?s   private club in Florida, where he has spent the past two weeks away from his home in New York City, is likely to eclipse them all as the 45th president?s winter White House. And that was always the intention of Marjorie Meriweather Post, the cereal heiress and the property?s original owner, who left    to the federal government when she died in 1973, hoping it would serve as a home for presidents. But the government had no interest in her plan, and Mr. Trump later bought the property for less than $10 million, turning it into a club where membership costs six figures. Mr. Trump?s arrival was greeted with sneers by the Palm Beach elite, and he opened up   ?s membership to Jews and   who had been excluded from other   establishments. He was also the first club owner on the island to admit an openly gay couple. Since Mr. Trump?s victory in November,    has been stuffed with guests attracted by an amenity unique to this club: the chance to rub shoulders with the next president. ?It?s like going to Disneyland and knowing Mickey Mouse will be there all day long,? said Jeff Greene, a developer and unsuccessful Democratic candidate for the Senate from Florida in 2010, who is a    member and was a Hillary Clinton supporter. Instead of hosting major corporate executives and potential cabinet secretaries for interviews inside a boxy transition office at Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan, Mr. Trump has been seated at an ornately designed couch, upholstered in pale fabric laced with gold, beneath a chandelier hanging from the ceiling, a scene resembling a mansion in ?Sunset Boulevard? or ?Citizen Kane,? two of Mr. Trump?s favorite movies. At night, the couches are moved out and tables are added to accommodate the evening cocktail crowd, among whom Mr. Trump moves from one table to the next, the most powerful greeter in the world. At the annual New Year?s Eve party on Saturday night, a   white menu included ?Mr. Trump?s wedge salad,? a wild mushroom and Swiss chard ravioli and a ?breakfast buffet. ? Those in attendance drifted in under a    striped awning, the men dressed in tuxedos, the women in ball gowns, many with their hair swept high. Guests stepped onto a red carpet as they entered the club and wandered over to a poolside cocktail party. Mr. Trump later delivered remarks, according to a guest, who said he thanked his family and the club members for their support over the years. Howie Carr, a conservative radio host who was supportive of Mr. Trump, roamed the crowd, with Mr. Carr posting on Twitter that his daughter asked Mr. Trump if she could be an intern in the White House. Mr. Trump?s two adult sons, Eric and Donald Jr. posed for photographs. Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski from MSNBC?s ?Morning Joe? were also there. Like most aspects of Mr. Trump?s business interests, the party generated controversy as tickets to it were made available to club members and guests for a little more than $500. Mr. Trump?s aides rejected the questions. Mr. Trump returned to New York on Sunday night. But the club will remain an escape for him. His contentious Twitter posts belie his relative calm when he is at    compared with when he is isolated inside Trump Tower. Mr. Trump?s combative public persona  ?   often on display during his campaign  ?   mostly dissolves behind the   walls of his castle. ?   is an environment he can control,? said the historian Douglas Brinkley, who last week attended a    lunch with a longtime club member, Chris Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media. ?I watched him hold court  ?   he was so comfortable in his own skin, and so relaxed. ? Mr. Ruddy has hosted Mr. Carr and Laura Ingraham, another conservative radio host who supported Mr. Trump, at the club and has introduced Mr. Trump to a range of news media figures, politicians and donors. He described the   as ?seeking the   Donald Trump: totally at ease, very positive, very gregarious. ? Mr. Trump appears to feed off contact with the people at the club. Over the Thanksgiving holiday, he queried dinner guests about whether he should appoint Rudolph W. Giuliani or Mitt Romney as his secretary of state (he ended up picking neither). During this trip, he has heaped praise on his ultimate choice for the job, Rex W. Tillerson, the head of Exxon Mobil. (Mr. Trump has called him ?Mr. Exxon. ?) He talks about the work he has done to find a solution for the problems at the Department of Veteran Affairs, which included a recent meeting with a number of executives at   . Mr. Trump told a New York Times reporter that he intended to make Brian Burns, the businessman son of a confidante of Joseph P. Kennedy, the ambassador to Ireland. Isaac Perlmutter, the reclusive head of Marvel Entertainment, is a    member who helped Mr. Trump put that meeting together. Mr. Trump has also held   with Robert K. Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots and a club member, and hosted prominent figures like Carlos Slim, the billionaire who is Mexico?s richest man. Mr. Trump his wife, Melania and their    son, Barron, inhabit a residential area of the club. His adult children and their families usually stay in nearby cabanas on the property. Mr. Trump frequently dines on the patio, a central point of action, where at night a singer plays with a small band, sometimes belting out requests from Mr. Trump and other guests. (?My Way,? a song popularized by Frank Sinatra, was one recent choice.) A violinist sometimes moves among tables, plucking tunes like the theme from ?Fiddler on the Roof. ? Mr. Trump has given the cadre of White House reporters who now cover him some access to the club, but grudgingly so  ?   he once again eluded the reporters covering him on Saturday, slipping away without any warning to play golf at another of his clubs nearby in Jupiter. And outside the confines of    old grievances flare up. On the golf course, Mr. Trump spotted Harry Hurt, a biographer who wrote critically of Mr. Trump years ago, preparing to play a round with David H. Koch, a billionaire conservative donor. Mr. Trump ordered club officials to remove Mr. Hurt from the property, according to a Facebook post by Mr. Hurt. Over the years, Mr. Trump has also been perpetually at loggerheads with Palm Beach officials. He has filed lawsuits attempting to keep noisy planes from flying over    and there have been disputes over the height of his oversize flagpole on the grounds. With its owner?s coming new job, the club has had some changes. Guests now go through an elaborate security screen to gain access to the main entrance. Secret Service agents are now sprinkled throughout the property, at night blending into the shrubbery along the grounds. Robin Bernstein, a club member for nearly 25 years, said that some club members might express frustration, but that most thought it was important ?that we keep Donald and his family safe. ? Attendees seem to see a benefit so far in having the   around, and expect it will continue. ?The loser in this game is Camp David,? said Mr. Brinkley, referring to the longtime presidential retreat in Maryland. ?Once you?re at    and it?s so opulent and   the idea of suddenly inserting yourself into Camp David?s Maryland mountains environment seems unlikely. ?"
17932,Jonathan Rauch,12/02/2017,2017,2,business,"EARNING THE ROCKIES How Geography Shapes America?s Role in the World By Robert D. Kaplan 201 pp. Random House. $27. Well over half of American voters, having cast ballots for Hillary Clinton or   candidates, awoke the next morning to a country that seems not only unfamiliar but  . Populists embrace a celebrity billionaire, evangelicals welcome a   Lothario, conservatives accept an opportunist whose only ideological commitment is to himself. The Republican establishment proves helpless against the hijacking of the party, the mainstream media prove ineffectual against the tide of fake news and the political system proves vulnerable to the machinations of a sinister foreign government. Longstanding global alliances are questioned, longstanding political norms are trashed  ?   and then the candidate with the    plurality loses. In what alternative universe does this make any sense? As Karl Marx said, in a very different context: All that is solid melts into air. Or maybe not. Maybe the political air is turbulent but the country?s tectonic fundamentals remain solid. Maybe American politics and geopolitics rest on a foundation as immovable as the rivers and plains of the country itself. For those who feel disoriented, and also (perhaps especially) for those who feel triumphant, Robert D. Kaplan?s small but magisterial new book, ?Earning the Rockies,? is a tonic, because it brings fundamentals back into view. With only 180 uncrowded pages of text, this is a book that can be read on a    flight, but fully digesting it will take much longer. Every page brings a fresh insight, a telling aper?u, a bracing reality check. If you do read the book at 30, 000 feet, it will make you yearn to be down below. To understand the country, Kaplan posits, one must still ?earn the Rockies,? reaching them on terra firma as our ancestors did. ?To fly to California and set your clock back three hours is not to know the ground you have covered, because you haven?t seen all the different mornings and evenings along the way. ? Kaplan is one of America?s most distinguished writers on foreign affairs, with 16 prior books to his name. (He and I are both contributing editors of The Atlantic, though we don?t know each other.) Many will recall his 1994 Atlantic article (then book) ?The Coming Anarchy,? which looks eerily prescient today. In his teens as a hitchhiker and again in middle age as a journalist, Kaplan trekked across the continental United States. Today, perplexed by America?s pivot against the successful global order that Americans built, he repeats the journey, ?for the answers to our dilemmas overseas lie within the continent itself. ? He returns with a musing travelogue, one that seeks, in words as carefully chosen as gemstones, to bring America?s geographic and geopolitical fundamentals back into the picture. He begins in the East, where the landscape is vertical, cluttered with tall trees and taller cities. Walking streets that are thriving and dismal by turns, and overhearing conversations in rural diners and urban coffeehouses, he encounters not one country but two. Wheeling, in West Virginia coal country, is in a shocking state of collapse, but across the bridge in Marietta, Ohio, he finds prosperity fueled by   fracking. In Bloomington, the home of Indiana University, he finds ?a truly global civilization,? demarcated by ?miles and miles of expensive restaurants and   people. ? The new ?universal civilization? is slowly dissolving local distinctiveness, but only for some: Bloomington?s elites understand their British counterparts better than they do their compatriots in Wheeling. In place after place, Kaplan encounters people who, though friendly and   ?have in some important ways just given up. ? Even in blue states, many ?feel their way of life is being endangered and fear being economically left behind in this new world of slim people on   diets with stylish clothes. ? Then the ?horizontal landscape? of the Great Plains unfurls before him, followed by the great American desert of the West, endless landscapes that forged an independent ethos yet, paradoxically, were built with the aid of enormous government investment. Here he finds the cradle of America?s international ambitions: ?If this unending vastness could be conquered, then, after some fashion, the world could be, too. ? At last, he arrives in San Diego, overlooking the port of the mighty United States Pacific Fleet and peering over the horizon toward Asia, where the fleet?s patrols keep an uneasy peace. What do we learn along the way? For all the turbulent change swirling about us now, America was and remains the product of an exceptional geography. North America has more miles of navigable inland waterways than much of the rest of the world combined. Better still, its rivers run diagonally rather than (as in Russia) north and south, forming an ideal network for internal communication and trade. Moreover, America?s continental span and rich resource base shield it from external threat and dependency. Thus the United States is uniquely blessed by geography to form and sustain a cohesive continental union. Union is not the same as unity, but it?s a good start. America?s geographical and hydrological blessings ramify not only inward but also outward. ?The United States is not a normal country: Its geographic bounty gave it the possibility of becoming a world power, and with that power it has developed longstanding obligations, which, on account of its continued economic and social dynamism relative to other powers, it keeps,? Kaplan writes. ?We are,? he says (his italics) ?fated to lead. ? For a host of reasons, ranging from geography to culture, no other country can play the same role. Kaplan embraces America?s   role but is no imperialist. His book is most challenging, and most valuable, for the layers of paradox it mines. Geography and union make the United States a hegemon whose auspices create the conditions for globalization  ?   but globalization diminishes America?s geographical advantages and erodes American unity. Meanwhile, as globalization uproots local economies and norms, the communications revolution spawns new tribal and ideological identities, everything from jihadism to  . ?It isn?t the clash of civilizations so much as the clash of artificially reconstructed civilizations that is taking place,? Kaplan writes. Finally, globalization, a product of American influence and a bulwark against chaos, erodes American influence and births new disruptions. For all its unrivaled military and economic power, the United States ?now has no possibility of bringing order to the world. ? The best we can hope for is to reduce disorder. Doing that requires projecting power, yes, but with a ?light and subtle footprint. ? It won?t be easy. ?Earning the Rockies? was written before the 2016 election. The name ?Trump? appears only a few times. Yet there is more insight here into the Age of Trump than in bushels of    journalism. George H. W. Bush imagined a new world order and, for a time, built one Bill Clinton embraced soft power and democratic globalization and, for a time, made them work George W. Bush rediscovered history, confrontation, hard power and blowback Barack Obama sought to revive Clinton?s formula but, in the end, left too many behind. And then came Trump, repudiating all of the above for irredentist nationalism, and smashing crockery as none have done since Andrew Jackson. Where are we now? In territory that is uncharted but not altogether unfamiliar. President Trump may try to ignore the paradoxes of geography and globalism, but he cannot escape them. In the long run, Kaplan reminds us, the shape of the river constrains the pilot?s course. America will continue to lead, because it must."
18353,Sam Roberts,10/02/2017,2017,2,entertainment,"Music was not only Walter Hautzig?s vocation. It also won over the young woman who would become his wife. And it saved his life. Mr. Hautzig, a concert pianist who escaped from   Vienna as a teenager armed with a fellowship from the Jerusalem Conservatory and went on to become a touring musical   ambassador, died on Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 95. The cause was congestive heart failure, his daughter, Deborah Hautzig, said. Only five years after he blustered his way into an audition with the conservatory?s director in 1938, the    Mr. Hautzig made his American debut at Town Hall in New York with an ambitious program of Bach, Beethoven and Chopin. A reviewer for The New York Times said it ?augured a brilliant career. ? Years later, Mr. Hautzig recalled, ?My father said I should be a doctor or a lawyer, but after Town Hall, he never left the house without the New York Times review in his pocket. ? Mr. Hautzig (pronounced  ) won the 1943 Town Hall Endowment Series Award for best young artist that year. He later became a cultural ambassador for the United States, performing around the world for three decades. In the 1950s he performed frequently in Japan under State Department sponsorship. In 1979, after relations thawed, he was the first American artist officially delegated to perform in mainland China. ?Beethoven and Chopin are as good for the Asians as for the Europeans as for the Jews as for the gentiles,? he told The Forward in 2007. He refused, however, to perform before a racially segregated audience in Alabama in the 1940s. ?He told the concert manager, ?You?re as bad as the Nazis! ?? Ms. Hautzig, his daughter, recalled in her eulogy at his funeral on Thursday. ?They said, ?Go back where you came from. ?? While music affected Mr. Hautzig profoundly, the instrument that spared him from Nazi persecution and led to his marriage entered his personal life serendipitously. ?His father had had a big success in his business and told my grandmother she had two choices: She could have a fur coat, or she could have a piano,? Ms. Hautzig said in her eulogy. ?She chose the piano. ? Her father began playing it when he was 4. Walter Hautzig was born on Sept. 28, 1921, in Vienna to the former Rosa Zwim and David Hautzig, a bookbinder. He studied at the Vienna Academy of Music until the German annexation of Austria capped a period of growing   there, during which he was arrested at least once and also forced to scrub streets on his knees. ?They made the world believe that they were Hitler?s first victims, but Hitler?s army was received with kisses,? he said of Austrians. When the music academy was shuttered and seized by German soldiers, he practiced the piano on his own at home. ?I said to myself, ?This they can never take away from me,?? he recalled in a documentary filmed by his granddaughter Molly DeVries. Responding to an advertisement in a Jewish newspaper, he arrived at a Vienna hotel at 8 a. m. to audition for Emil Hauser, director of the Jerusalem Conservatory and a founder of the Budapest String Quartet. Mr. Hauser was not just offering fellowships he was also offering exit visas. Mr. Hauser finally surfaced at 2 p. m. and apologized, saying he had had to rush to another appointment. Audaciously, Mr. Hautzig joined him in a taxi, and when they arrived at a private apartment that happened to have a piano, Mr. Hauser pointed to it and said, ?Spiel!? (?Play! ?) Mr. Hautzig performed Beethoven?s ?Waldstein? Sonata. ?When I finished playing,? Mr. Hautzig said, ?he exclaimed, ?No matter what it takes, I will make sure that you come to Jerusalem. ?? A month later he arrived in what was then Palestine, where he studied under Josef Tal and Alfred Schroeder and performed as a soloist with the Jerusalem Academy Orchestra. After a year and a half, he joined his parents and sister, who had fled through Switzerland, in New York. He studied privately with Artur Schnabel and enrolled in the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. He was later a professor of piano at the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore, from 1960 to 1988. He continued to perform until a few years ago. Returning from Scandinavia, where he performed to raise money for war victims of the Nazis, he met Esther Rudomin. She was on her way to New York from Siberia, where her family had been exiled. She was 16 and seasick. ?I played for her the G minor Ballade of Chopin,? Mr. Hautzig said, ?and she said, ?Anybody who plays like that has to be good. ?? They married in 1950. Esther Hautzig, who became an author of children?s books, died in 2009. In addition to his daughter, Mr. Hautzig is survived by a son, David, and three grandchildren. The Hautzigs lived in an Upper West Side apartment building, and Mrs. Hautzig once cited the unique challenges that urban acoustics posed for a professional musician. ?A neighbor called and said, ?Mrs. Hautzig, your husband?s practicing is driving me crazy,?? she recalled. ?I gulped and apologized. The neighbor interrupted my apologies: ?No, what?s he practicing? I know the piece and can?t remember what it is! ??"
18005,Keith Bradsher,28/01/2017,2017,1,law,"Enjoy the guacamole as you watch the Super Bowl on Feb. 5. Some of the ingredients might be a little more expensive next year. House Republicans and President Trump have been talking about imposing a 20 percent tax on imported goods, with a White House spokesman suggesting on Thursday that such a tax might start with goods from Mexico. With the tax, the price for some heavily imported items could go up. But other foods produced mainly in the United States might become slightly cheaper. While many details remain unclear, here are a few indications of how the tax might work and how it would affect prices in the fruit and vegetable aisle at the supermarket. A third of all avocados eaten by Americans are grown in the United States and the rest are imported. More than nine of every 10 imported avocados come from Mexico, while most of the rest come from Chile, Peru and the Dominican Republic. The average retail price of an avocado varies considerably. Prices can creep up toward $1. 50 for the Super Bowl and Fourth of July, the two biggest spikes in demand. The retail price falls toward $1 apiece around Christmas, as demand falters but the trees, grown in mild, subtropical climates, keep producing. Organically grown avocados have been commanding a premium of about 30 percent lately, a premium that has widened over the last few years. The tax would not end up being 20 percent of a $1 to $1. 50 avocado, which would be 20 to 30 cents. That is because the import tax would only be on what is known a the dutiable value  ?   the wholesale price of the avocado assessed when it crosses the border. That does not include the cost of trucking it from the border to a grocery store in the United States, the store?s rent, the store?s bills for   and other utilities, or the wages for the store?s staff. None of these costs would be subject to the tax, but can help determine the retail price of the avocado. For the first 11 months of last year, the average wholesale price of avocados crossing the border was 50 cents apiece. So a 20 percent tax on that wholesale price at the border would only add a dime to the cost of each avocado. It takes four or five years for a newly planted avocado tree to bear fruit. If an import tax were to be imposed on foreign avocados, American farmers could not increase production quickly. That means many Americans might have to pay for taxed avocados imported from Mexico and elsewhere for a few years, or potentially do without. That is right  ?   a good guacamole needs onions, lime juice and a few other ingredients as well. Just look at onions. Seven out of eight onions eaten by Americans are grown in the United States. They also tend to be grown by companies  ?   even the   onion farmers tend to incorporate their farms  ?   so they owe corporate tax. That is notable because various plans being circulated call for a border tax to be used to help reduce the corporate profits tax. Right now, the corporate profits tax is 35 percent. Multinationals like Apple actually pay a lot less, in part because much of their profits are held offshore. That is harder for an onion farmer to do, although there are tax breaks for farmers. With those qualifiers, the introduction of a border tax is expected to produce enough revenue to offset the losses from lowering the tax on corporate profits to 25 percent, 20 percent or even 15 percent, depending on the proposal. That would ultimately help cut the tax bill for onion farmers. The whole idea behind the House Republicans? plan is that companies producing in the United States should pay lower taxes, so those companies can hire more workers. The tax burden would be shifted toward importers, but also toward people who buy imported goods. Companies tend to pass on the cost of taxes to consumers, while pocketing any tax savings, when there are only a few businesses in the industry and limited competition. The opposite can also be true: companies in highly competitive industries tend to pay extra taxes out of their own profits, because raising prices might result in lower market share. In those cases, they tend to pass on tax savings to consumers. Onion farmers might also use their tax savings to hire more workers and export more. The United States imports a few more onions than it exports, but most onion farmers simply grow for the domestic market. A corporate tax cut linked to a border tax might prompt them to expand globally, which is the whole idea behind a border tax. That is tough to predict, and also depends on inflation and other factors, not just the border tax. The odds are that a border tax would drive up the cost of guacamole, because avocados, not onions, account for most of the cost of making it, and most avocados are imported. But the details of the tax, and how markets respond to it, will also make a big difference."
17643,Mark Landler,16/01/2017,2017,1,business,"WASHINGTON  ?   On Friday, Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia, declared that he did not view Donald J. Trump as a ?legitimate president. ? Mr. Lewis, an icon of the civil rights movement, said he planned to boycott the inauguration, the first he will skip in three decades. On Saturday, Mr. Trump hit back. ?Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results,? Mr. Trump said in a pair of early morning Twitter posts. ?All talk, talk, talk  ?   no action or results,? he added. ?Sad!? While some questioned Mr. Lewis?s assertion, many others expressed indignation about Mr. Trump?s outburst, pointing out the unseemliness of attacking a civil rights leader on the eve of Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Mr. Lewis was one of the original Freedom Riders, beaten by police officers while marching from Selma to Montgomery in Alabama. Others ridiculed Mr. Trump?s characterization of Mr. Lewis?s district, which is majority   and encompasses   of Atlanta, as ?horrible,? ?falling apart? and ?crime infested. ? In fact, Georgia?s Fifth Congressional District includes parts of wealthy areas like Buckhead the world?s busiest airport,   the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Georgia Institute of Technology. Some pointed out that fighting with Mr. Lewis distracted attention from a Senate investigation, announced the day before, that will look at possible contacts between Mr. Trump?s campaign team and Russia. In addition, Mr. Trump?s poll numbers have slipped into uncharted depths for an incoming president, with a Gallup poll released on Friday finding that about half of Americans disapprove of Mr. Trump?s transition effort. Mr. Trump?s feud with Mr. Lewis carried echoes of his attacks on Khizr and Ghazala Khan, the   parents of an American soldier killed in Iraq, after Mr. Khan spoke out against Mr. Trump at the Democratic National Convention. Those attacks were widely viewed to have backfired, and Mr. Trump later modulated his words about the Khans. Mr. Trump himself has experience questioning a president?s legitimacy. He was instrumental in sowing doubts about President Obama?s birthplace. Mr. Lewis, who is 76 and was first elected to Congress in 1987, is one of the few genuinely historic figures on Capitol Hill, revered by Democrats and Republicans alike. Allies of Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama and Mr. Trump?s nominee for attorney general, circulated pictures of him linking arms with Mr. Lewis at the 50th anniversary of the Selma march to fend off accusations that Mr. Sessions was a racist. Nevertheless, Mr. Lewis testified against Mr. Sessions, declaring, ?We need someone as attorney general who?s going to look out for all of us, and not just some of us. ? A few critics, including David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to Mr. Obama, said they disagreed with Mr. Lewis?s statement that Mr. Trump was not legitimate, which he made in an interview with Chuck Todd of NBC News and which will be broadcast on ?Meet the Press? on Sunday. Still, Mr. Axelrod said of Mr. Lewis: ?I honor the man he is. Honesty integrity courage  ?   these are qualities you can?t buy. ? In his interview with Mr. Todd, Mr. Lewis said he believed that the Russians had delivered the election to Mr. Trump. ?You know, I believe in forgiveness,? he said. ?I believe in trying to work with people. It will be hard. It?s going to be very difficult. I don?t see this   as a legitimate president. ? Mr. Lewis is one of a handful of Democratic members of Congress who have announced that they will boycott the inauguration on Friday. Others include Barbara Lee of California, Earl Blumenauer of Oregon, Katherine Clark of Massachusetts and Luis Guti?rrez of Illinois."
17715,Peter Baker,19/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"WASHINGTON  ?   In one way at least,   Donald J. Trump has already surpassed all of his recent predecessors. It took Barack Obama 18 months in the White House for his approval rating to slip to 44 percent in Gallup polling, and it took George W. Bush 4® years to fall that far. Mr. Trump got there before even being sworn in. Indeed, Mr. Trump will take office on Friday with less popular support than any new president in modern times, according to an array of surveys, a sign that he has failed to rally Americans behind him, beyond the base that helped him win in November. Rather than a unifying moment, his transition to power has seen a continuation of the polarization of the election last year. Where other presidents used the weeks before their inauguration to put the animosities of the campaign behind them and to try to knit the country together again, Mr. Trump has approached the interregnum as if he were a television wrestling star. He has taken on a civil rights icon, a Hollywood actress, intelligence agencies, defense contractors, European leaders and President Obama. The healing theme common at this stage in the   presidential cycle is absent. ?He seems to want to engage with every windmill that he can find, rather than focus on the large aspect of assuming the most important position on earth,? Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said on CNN on Tuesday. ?And obviously, apparently, according to the polls, many Americans are not happy with that approach when he has not even assumed the presidency. ? Two polls out on Tuesday  ?   one by CNN and ORC and another by The Washington Post and ABC News  ?   found that just 40 percent of Americans approved of Mr. Trump?s performance heading into the inauguration on Friday. NBC News and The Wall Street Journal put his approval rating at 44 percent, calling it the lowest rating ever for an incoming president. By comparison, shortly after their inaugurations, Mr. Obama was at 68 percent and Mr. Bush was at 57 percent in Gallup surveys. Both used the time after their initial victories to preach a message of inclusion and to extend a hand to their opposition, even if it did not ultimately last. Mr. Trump?s advisers said privately that his unexpected rise to power showed that such traditional barometers did not matter as much anymore. If polls were to be believed, he would not have been president, they said. Still, the anemic numbers clearly irritated Mr. Trump, who lashed out on Tuesday. ?The same people who did the phony election polls, and were so wrong, are now doing approval rating polls,? he wrote on Twitter. ?They are rigged just like before. ? Although polling in several Midwest battleground states failed to accurately reflect the actual results on Election Day, national polls generally came within a percentage point of the actual popular vote, which Hillary Clinton won with 48 percent to Mr. Trump?s 46 percent. For Mr. Trump, the worry about approval ratings would be less about what it might mean for the next election, still years away, but about how such numbers are interpreted by members of Congress, who historically have been more deferential to popular presidents than unpopular ones. ?Every president starts off with a   account with Congress that eventually draws down,? said Phil Schiliro, who was Mr. Obama?s White House legislative director in his first term. ?As approval ratings drop, the account sinks very quickly. And that makes it much harder to bring Congress along on the president?s priorities. ? Steve Israel, a Democrat who represented New York in the House, said the biggest challenge for Mr. Trump might be with nervous members of his own party. ?Right now, Trump?s numbers are kryptonite for 21 House Republicans in districts that he lost,? he said. ?So not only does he begin with low poll numbers, he begins with a significant potential bloc of resistance in his own caucus. ? But Mr. Trump has shown that he intends to lead more through force of personality than through the breadth of his coalition. Brash and uninhibited, he seeks out enemies and allows few slights to go unanswered. He has repaired bridges with some critics, like Mitt Romney, but has made only sporadic efforts to reach out to parts of the public that have not supported him. His strongest supporters cheer his pugnacious style, and he argues that it has gotten results, like when House Republicans backed off plans to undercut the authority of the Office of Congressional Ethics, or major employers reversed plans to move jobs overseas after he wrote on Twitter about his disapproval. ?With all of the jobs I am bringing back into the U. S. (even before taking office) with all of the new auto plants coming back into our country and with the massive cost reductions I have negotiated on military purchases and more, I believe the people are seeing ?big stuff,? ? Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Tuesday. For many years, presidents and their advisers quaked at polls that showed a drop in their ratings, fearful that it would hurt their ability to command the stage and to enact their agendas. The last two presidents governed for long stretches with less than majority support, which clearly limited their capacity to advance major legislation. But they both also demonstrated that they could still make at least some progress. Mr. Bush never had the support of more than 50 percent of Americans for nearly his entire second term and fell into the 20s before leaving office. Still, he ignored poll numbers and the opposition of Democrats to send reinforcements to Iraq to turn around a losing war. Mr. Obama never fell as far, but he went for many months below 50 percent and turned to his executive authority to enact policies on immigration and the environment. He rebounded in public standing in the last few months and will leave office at 56 percent in the   poll, near his highest marks. Some Republicans now say Mr. Trump has rewritten the rule book. ?Polling more and more is a false god,? said Ron Kaufman, the White House political director under President George Bush and a longtime Republican strategist. ?We all play to it, but it?s a false god. I just think it?s no longer reliable as a judge. ? Mary Matalin, who was a top counselor to Vice President Dick Cheney, who ignored his own low approval ratings while in office to focus on advancing his national security agenda, said Mr. Trump ?has ushered in a new political paradigm? that has upended   assumptions. ?Trump has exposed the inadequacy and fallibility of   domestic political strategy of governing by polls and contrived expectations,? she said. ?In the new Trump world, it has already been proven prima facie absurd to presume personal approval numbers to be more   than policy approval. ?"
17391,Julie Hirschfeld Davis,6/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"WASHINGTON  ?     Donald J. Trump?s transition staff has issued a blanket edict requiring politically appointed ambassadors to leave their overseas posts by Inauguration Day, according to several American diplomats familiar with the plan, breaking with decades of precedent by declining to provide even the briefest of grace periods. The mandate  ?   issued ?without exceptions,? according to a terse State Department cable sent on Dec. 23, diplomats who saw it said  ?   threatens to leave the United States without   envoys for months in critical nations like Germany, Canada and Britain. In the past, administrations of both parties have often granted extensions on a    basis to allow a handful of ambassadors, particularly those with   children, to remain in place for weeks or months. Mr. Trump, by contrast, has taken a hard line against leaving any of President Obama?s political appointees in place as he prepares to take office on Jan. 20 with a mission of dismantling many of his predecessor?s signature foreign and domestic policy achievements. ?Political? ambassadors, many of them major donors who are nominated by virtue of close ties with the president, almost always leave at the end of his term ambassadors who are career diplomats often remain in their posts. A senior Trump transition official said there was no ill will in the move, describing it as a simple matter of ensuring that Mr. Obama?s overseas appointees leave the government on schedule, just as thousands of political aides at the White House and in federal agencies must do. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity about internal deliberations, said the ambassadors should not be surprised about being held to a hard end date. The directive has nonetheless upended the personal lives of many ambassadors, who are scrambling to secure living arrangements and acquire visas allowing them to remain in their countries so their children can remain in school, the diplomats said. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly on the matter. In Costa Rica, Ambassador Stafford Fitzgerald Haney is hunting for a house or an apartment as his family  ?   which includes four   children and his wife, who has been battling breast cancer  ?   struggles to figure out how to avoid a move back to the United States with five months left in the school year, according to the diplomats. In the Czech Republic, they said, Ambassador Andrew H. Schapiro is seeking housing in Prague as well as lobbying his children?s   school to break with policy and accept them back midyear. In Brussels and Geneva, Denise Bauer, the United States ambassador to Belgium, and Pamela Hamamoto, the permanent representative to the United Nations, are both trying to find a way to keep daughters from having to move just months before their high school graduation. Ronald E. Neumann, the president of the American Academy of Diplomacy, a   nonprofit association for former ambassadors and senior diplomats, said it was reasonable to expect ambassadors to return at the end of a term, given that they are direct representatives of the president with broad grants of authority. But he could not recall an occasion on which such a strict timeline had been applied. ?When you have people out there whose only reason for being an ambassador is their political connection to the outgoing president of a different party, it?s pretty logical to say they should leave,? said Mr. Neumann, a career Foreign Service officer who held ambassadorships in Algeria, Bahrain and Afghanistan. ?But I don?t recollect there was ever a guillotine in January where it was just, ?Everybody out of the pool immediately. ?? W. Robert Pearson, a former ambassador to Turkey and a scholar at the Middle East Institute in Washington, said the rule was ?quite extraordinary,? adding that it could undermine American interests and signal a hasty change in direction that exacerbates jitters among allies about their relationships with the new administration. With the world already primed to be worrying about such an abrupt change, ?this is just a very concrete signal that it is going to happen,? Mr. Pearson said. At a White House farewell reception that Mr. Obama held on Wednesday night for noncareer ambassadors, many of them commiserated, attendees said, comparing notes about how to handle the situation. Some expressed dismay that Mr. Trump, whose wife, Melania, has chosen to stay in New York to avoid moving the couple?s    son, Barron, to a new school midyear, would not ensure that such allowances were made for American ambassadors. They are weighing a direct appeal to Rex W. Tillerson, Mr. Trump?s nominee for secretary of state, or other top transition officials to reconsider the policy. Derek Shearer, a professor of diplomacy at Occidental College who is a former United States ambassador to Finland, said it was difficult to see a rationale for the decision. ?It feels like there?s an element just of spite and payback in it,? he said. ?I don?t see a higher policy motive. ? The State Department informed all politically appointed ambassadors in a letter the day after the election that they were to submit letters of resignation effective Jan. 20. It instructed those who wanted to seek extensions to submit formal requests explaining their justifications. Incoming presidents of both parties have often made exceptions to allow ambassadors to wrap up personal affairs and important diplomatic business while their successors were in the confirmation process, which can take months. Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Mr. Obama all granted extensions for a few politically appointed ambassadors. Former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell offered particularly wide latitude to ambassadors facing family issues, said Marc Grossman, a longtime diplomat and former top State Department official who is vice chairman of the Cohen Group, a Washington consultancy. ?This was something that was important to Secretary Powell because of his own experience living and serving all over the world, so when people asked him, ?Could I stay another couple of weeks, couple of months my kids are finishing school,? he was very accommodating,? Mr. Grossman said, adding that his flexibility was an ?exception? to the general practice. ?He was trying to, I think, send a message that family was important. ?"
18323,Guy Trebay,6/02/2017,2017,2,business,"?An idea is a good thing,? Ken Downing, the fashion director of Neiman Marcus, said on Tuesday, as he bolted in his biker jacket and skinny jeans from one show to another. ?But a theme can scare me running away. ? Despite everyone?s best efforts to shut out the world beyond New York Fashion Week: Men?s, a unifying theme emerged: the parlous state of current politics. It didn?t matter that the visitors to the Skylight Clarkson North event space in Lower Manhattan, where most of the shows were held, tried to drink away their worries at the cozy VIP Amazon Lounge or escaped into chatter about Alejandro Gmez Palomo, a young Spanish designer who shocked the front row with a show featuring men in frilly frocks or talked about the head of Ralph Lauren being unceremoniously shoved into the oubliette. Of the dozens of designers interviewed during a   marathon that ended on Thursday, not one failed to volunteer some expression of concern, anxiety, perplexity or stark anger about the barrage of executive orders, tweets and statements recently issued from the White House. ?It?s hitting people like a dagger in the heart,? the designer John Varvatos said moments before his best men?s wear show in years, at the Diamond Horseshoe nightclub in Midtown. Mr. Varvatos was referring to President Trump?s order banning the entry of citizens from seven   nations and refugees from any country. ?People are in disbelief,? Mr. Varvatos said. ?Half the people in my company are from someplace else. ? So, it would seem, are half the personnel in the industry. Consider the major designers anchoring a men?s wear fashion week now in its fourth iteration and gaining strength in terms of its offerings and the breadth of representation. Mr. Varvatos, for example, is a   American whose parents migrated from Greece and settled in Detroit. The   Ralph Lauren is the son of Askhenazi Jewish immigrants from Belarus. Raised in South Boston, Joseph Abboud was born in the United States to Maronite Christian parents who, seeking greater opportunity, fled Lebanon for America. Even the virtuosic   Raf Simons  ?   whose finely calibrated collection of satiny topcoats, boxy jackets and slouchy woolens was shown on Wednesday night  ?   has only recently transposed his    label to New York, where he also serves as chief creative officer of Calvin Klein. Notably, Mr. Simons chose as the locale for his debut on these shores a Gagosian Gallery, which is run by the   art world powerhouse Larry Gagosian, a California native whose grandparents were immigrants from Armenia. It is not only the big guns who can boast of a hyphenated heritage. The Ovadia twins, Ariel and Shimon, moved to Brooklyn from Israel in the early 1990s. The slick show they presented on Tuesday to an audience peppered with   stars and athletes was inspired, as Ariel said backstage, by a soccer obsession they share with their father, a man who got his start in the garment business selling children?s wear from the back of a   Oldsmobile. A relative newcomer to fashion, Willy Chavarria presented a sublimely deadpan collection on Thursday that he titled ?Brown Power? and showed on a group of   models that included a young trans woman and a Honduran food deliveryman. The clothes were inspired, Mr. Chavarria said, by Chicano youths in California towns like the one in the San Joaquin Valley where he was raised, a son of Mexican immigrants who worked in the agricultural fields. ?The political moment is hard,? Mr. Chavarria said, over the   din of recorded   at his presentation. ?But it?s also a call to action for a generation that maybe got a little lazy. It?s up to us now to be harder ourselves  ?   to love harder, to fight harder, to come hard with our ideas. ? Ideas, as Mr. Downing said, are good things. And, as it happened, the week was rife with them. There were Mr. Chavarria?s supersize denim trousers, his   coats of fur or washable alpaca, his knit caps discreetly embroidered with a rebuke to hate speech too coarse to be printed here and his athletic sweatshirts emblazoned with the timely: ?Gender Bender Super Bawl Champions. ? There were Mr. Simons?s innovative, oversize intarsia sweaters, developed in collaboration with the Woolmark Company, featuring hems that rode up at the back, kangaroo pockets on the chest and, in some cases, a vaguely ambivalent interpretation of Milton Glaser?s ?I ? NY? logo. There was a Ralph Lauren Purple Label collection that gave scant indication that his company is in the midst of what one analyst called ?brand confusion. ? Seldom bested as a conjurer of narrative fantasy during the   he has been in business, Mr. Lauren made it clear that his Gatsbyesque vision still has legs. Here he reimagined a young man of wealth as having humor enough to leave the house wearing a black satin dinner jacket whose subtle jacquard pattern depicts cowboys riding bucking broncos  ?   an image copied from a vintage sleeping bag  ?   and confident enough in his taste to wear a   suit of evening clothes in chocolate corduroy. Barely out of Parsons, Matthew Adams Dolan is already a name to reckon with, largely on the basis of an interest taken in him by a single superfan. ?Rihanna?s team saw my senior thesis and called in some things,? Mr. Dolan, a   native, said modestly on Thursday, as a cluster of models slumped on a dais at the P3 studio at Skylight Clarkson North. ?She gets photographed in them a lot, I guess,? he added, referring to monster denims that resemble the offspring of a Carhartt jacket and a moving blanket. Mr. Dolan?s affection for functional work wear, which he reconfigures in Brobdingnagian proportions, is only half the equation, he said. ?My mom was a big quilter, and that?s been a big influence on me,? he said. That Todd Snyder?s brightest ideas are often not original to him is something of which the designer makes no secret. For years, Mr. Snyder has mined thrift stores and the treasure troves maintained by folks like the   wizard Bob Melet for inspiration. As Mr. Snyder made clear in his Thursday show, his design skill lies in taking the   sports jerseys or the weary,   stadium coats he finds and then  ?   exploiting his savvy way with fabrics and his tailoring background  ?   turning them into covetable stuff like a handsome camel hair overcoat so pilled it looked as though he had skinned a family of teddy bears to create it. The primary idea driving Mr. Varvatos?s latest collection, he said before his show, involved his conviction that millennial men now discovering the suit want something that keeps them from resembling their fathers. ?They want to push out the boundaries,? Mr. Varvatos said. He does, too. With his fall 2017 collection, the designer stuck to a restrained narrow silhouette for taut frock coats, biker jackets, barn coats and     jackets. And he confined his experiments to fabrication. Despite the best efforts of moral philosophers like Peter Singer, fur has been steadily making a comeback. The best designs at the Varvatos show were for things like a lynx print calfskin biker jacket that would make anyone want to become rock star or a flimsy topcoat lined with cropped shearling  ?   just the sort of stuff to give PETA conniptions. It?s easy enough to guess at the outrage triggered in the mind of an   activist by Mr. Varvatos?s wholesale dispatch of livestock. More challenging, perhaps, is imagining what a traditional male might make of the clothes created by Mr. Palomo. Invited to be a guest of the C. F. D. A. the designer  ?   who has generated a lot of press and engendered a small cult following at home  ?   brought with him a group of clothes that seemed relatively tame by his standards. It included trousers, that is, and a few items you might term suits. True, they came in purple satin brocade with   portrait collars or gold lam? with flounces and neck frills or constituted little more than a white satin bustier worn with thigh boots and a pair of   briefs. Of all the many design ideas on display during New York Fashion Week: Men?s, Mr. Palomo?s were by miles the most fantastical and giddy. Yet, as the men?s wear industry has been trudging steadily away from gender fluidity and toward masculinity as historically constituted, the sight of a guy kitted out in Cuban heels, a garter belt, a pair of shiny culottes or a flounced   costume seemed less outrageous than, perhaps, pass?."
18188,JoAnna Klein,7/02/2017,2017,2,lifestyle,"We?re about 600 to 3, 000 feet below the ocean?s surface. It?s cold, it?s dark and it?s slow down here. If you?re lucky, it?s blue in the daytime and black at night. And the deeper we go, the darker it gets. Welcome to the twilight zone, fishies. There?s not much to eat and no green plants growing either. Here, you eat what you can get, and find a way to eat it, or you starve. It?s weird down here, in the mesopelagic zone of the deep sea. Creatures can be sluggish, but they are well adapted. Some use big eyes to find prey. Others make their own flashlights. Big mouths help predators eat big prey. That may be why barbeled dragonfishes have special head joints that allow them to open up their mouths 120 degrees and swallow big prey whole. This flexible head joint, described for the first time in a study published on Wednesday in the journal PLOS One, is unlike any other known to science. Nalani Schnell, a zoologist at the French National Museum of Natural History, had already discovered that different groups of barbeled dragonfishes had an unusual gap between their heads and necks that other fishes don?t have. Some gaps were the result of a missing first vertebrae. Others resulted from the absence of a spine, filled in instead with an elongated notochord, a flexible rod made up of something similar to cartilage. To find out the function of these gaps, Dr. Schnell teamed up with Dave Johnson, a zoologist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. Together, they obtained five divergent groups of the species from museum collections, macerated the flesh from their bodies and stained the bones different colors. This allowed them to actually move the bones around, which led to the discovery that the gap was a functional joint that allows the fish?s head to move up and out. ?In most other fishes, the head has a strong connection to the rest of the body, without much flexibility,? Dr. Schnell wrote in an email, which is a stabilizing force during swimming. But ?the barbeled dragonfishes are    (ambush) predators, and prey items are scarce in the  . ? As the species diverged into different groups, the flexible gaps in the more primitive fish developed into ?an actual folding apparatus that makes this a true joint,? Dr. Johnson said. ?There are no other fishes that have that sort of a directional, complex articulation. ? A joint that allows them to open their mouths wide is advantageous because they can engulf large prey that can sustain them for long periods of no food. Like the moray eel, barbeled dragonfishes use a second set of teeth to pull the large prey into their bodies to digest it. ?Imagine yourself out in the middle of the ocean, and you?re trying to make a living. You?re going to eat anything you can, if you think it isn?t going to kill you,? Dr. Johnson said. ?You don?t bypass this thing because it?s too big to eat, because you don?t know when you?re going to see another meal. ?"
18002,Daisuke Wakabayashi and Mike Isaac,27/01/2017,2017,1,technology,"SAN FRANCISCO  ?   Google and Facebook have been taking steps to curb the number of false news articles propagated across their sites. On Wednesday, the Silicon Valley companies showed that they were still in the early stages of their battle to limit misinformation online. In a blog post, Google said it had permanently banned nearly 200 publishers from its AdSense advertising network near the end of last year, after putting into effect a policy in November to choke off websites that try to deceive users from its online ad service. On the same day, Facebook introduced changes to its Trending Topics feature  ?   a part of the social network that some have blamed for spreading false information  ?   to better promote reliable news articles. Yet taken together, the efforts showed how the fight against fake news remains a work in progress. Google?s bans were a drop in the bucket compared with the almost two million publishers that use AdSense. Facebook?s new measures were part of a continuing series of small experiments by the company to find out what worked best in displaying news to its users. ?We genuinely asked Google and Facebook for ?moonshots,?? said Jason Kint, the chief executive of Digital Content Next, an online publishing industry group. ?We appreciate the work, but based on the numbers, that?s hardly even running in place. ? Google and Facebook have been in something of a   situation in recent months when it comes to fake news. Both companies have been grappling with a widespread backlash over how their sites may have spread rumors on a vast scale, and how little responsibility they take for any of the content that appears on their platforms. The issue came to a head after the American presidential election, when commentators accused Facebook in particular of swaying voters to President Trump through misleading and untrue news articles. In response, both companies have tried various measures to limit fake news. Google in November said it would ban sites that spread misinformation from AdSense as a way to impair how such sites make money. That same month, Facebook updated some of its policy language, which already said it would not display ads on sites that show misleading or illegal content, to include fake news sites. Facebook has since introduced other changes, including consulting   news organizations like The Associated Press and ABC News about the accuracy of articles that users report as being false. Google?s blog post on Wednesday was the first time the company explained the results of its moves against publishers that spread misinformation. The search giant said it reviewed 550 sites ?suspected of misrepresenting content to users, including impersonating news organizations? in November and December. It took action against 340 of those sites and kicked nearly 200 publishers off its network permanently. Google was careful not to say that these were fake news sites, only sites that deceive users by misrepresenting themselves or their content. This month, Media Matters noted that Google changed the language of its advertising policy, removing the words ?fake news. ? Google said the language change noted by Media Matters involved examples that help explain its policy but were not changes to the actual policy. Google declined to identify the sites or publishers it banned. Before taking steps to thwart fake news publishers, Google had an existing policy that outlawed publishers of ?misrepresentative content,? such as websites peddling   schemes or counterfeit goods. It expanded this policy to include sites impersonating news organizations. Google was pulled into the fake news debate when Mediaite reported that, in the days after the election, the top result on a Google search for ?final election vote count 2016? was a link to an article that incorrectly stated that Mr. Trump, who won the Electoral College, was ahead of his Democratic challenger, Hillary Clinton, in the popular vote. Google said that its search algorithms fell short but that the company would continue to work to improve its results. The AdSense system is a major revenue driver for independent web publishers who rely on the network to deliver display advertising on their sites. The publishers are paid when a reader views or clicks on those ads, with a portion of the proceeds going to Google. AdSense is one of the largest advertising networks on the web with nearly two million publishers using the system. Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the number of sites it has banned since November. Trending Topics is a feature on the social network that tells people what popular topics are being discussed on the site. Apart from more transparency around headlines, the changes to the feature on Wednesday included identifying popular topics through the number of publishers posting articles on Facebook about a piece of news, rather than engagement around a single article. ?Today?s update may also help prevent hoaxes and fake news from appearing in Trending because the updated system identifies groups of articles shared on Facebook instead of relying solely on mentions of a topic,? the company said in a blog post. Still, industry watchers remain skeptical about the efficacy of these moves. ?Nothing drives clicks better than when the headline is exactly what people want to hear or believe,? Ian Schafer, the chief executive and founder of Deep Focus, a digital advertising agency, referring specifically to Google. Mr. Schafer said that without significant changes to the economics and technology of online ads, banning individual sites would not produce change in the long run."
17634,Corinna da Fonseca-Wollheim,14/01/2017,2017,1,entertainment,"HAMBURG  ?   Of course there was Beethoven. After all, what better way to conclude the   opening concert of the Elbphilharmonie concert hall here than with the jubilant ?Ode to Joy?? It?s a choral classic, but Wednesday?s scintillating concert, starring the NDR Symphony Orchestra, now renamed the NDR Elbphilharmonie Orchestra, opened with the slender, pliable tone of a single oboe  ?   the instrument to which other players tune in halls around the world. To inaugurate this dazzling hall, nestled inside an $800 million glass structure set atop an old brick warehouse overlooking the port here, the conductor Thomas Hengelbrock assembled a   program. Taking as its motto a line from Wagner?s ?Parsifal?  ?   ?Here time becomes space?  ?   the concert linked fragile chamber performances and flashy orchestral tours de force spanning 400 years of music history into a riveting narrative. Its proud protagonist: the hall itself. Depending on where you sat in the tiered,    auditorium, you had to crane your neck to see where the first sounds were coming from when the oboist Kalev Kuljus, standing on a high balcony, intoned the first rhapsodic phrases of Britten?s ?Pan,? from ?Six Metamorphoses After Ovid. ? His penetrating and clear tone helped to concentrate your ear on the sonic roller coaster that followed, beginning with the metallic aureole of Dutilleux?s ?Myst?re de l?instant. ? From there, early and recent music alternated fluidly, with individual performers placed high in the farthest rows. The countertenor Philippe Jaroussky, elegantly accompanied by the harpist Margret K?ll, sang music written by Emilio de? Cavalieri and Antonio Archilei for a 1589 Florentine court wedding, his zesty voice effortlessly carrying across the   auditorium. The dark, growling rumbles of Bernd Alois Zimmermann?s ?Photoptosis,? in turn, gave way to the   Ensemble Praetorius singing Praetorius?s ?Quam Pulchra Es. ? That work was answered by the searing intensity of Rolf Liebermann?s ?Furioso,? with its   string scales and luscious, broad melodies. Another Baroque aria, ?Amarilli mia bella,? by Giulio Caccini, offered quiet reflection before the jaunty finale from Messiaen?s ?? its crisp rhythms and fluorescent tone colors vivid and clean. The concert?s second half included the Prelude to ?Parsifal? the premiere of an arresting, broody orchestral song cycle, ?Reminiszenz,? by Wolfgang Rihm and the last movement of Beethoven?s Ninth. The soloist in Rihm?s rangy, difficult new work was Pavol Breslik, whose melting tone easily made you forget that the part had initially been intended for the star tenor Jonas Kaufmann. Another cancellation led to the appealing   Mller?s taking on the soprano part in the Beethoven symphony, alongside the alto Wiebke Lehmkuhl and the   Bryn Terfel, sounding somewhat brittle. The combined NDR and Bavarian radio choirs brought home a thrilling ?Ode to Joy. ? If you were seated in different sections of the hall for the two performances (the program was repeated on Thursday night) the sound?s warmth varied. The Wagner could have been helped by a greater sense of mysticism: the acoustics cast a clinical light on occasional imperfections. (It was just as unforgiving of a visitor?s   sneeze.) But on the whole, the NDR Elbphilharmonie Orchestra revealed itself as a   group, possessing a radiantly confident brass section and strings capable of producing a   tone. The man behind the sound is Yasuhisa Toyota, one of the world?s most   acousticians. In Hamburg, his work was prepared for by the building?s architects, the Swiss firm Herzog  de Meuron, which added a   layer around each of the two concert halls to prevent the intrusion of foghorns and other city noise  ?   something New Yorkers, used to the periodic grumble of subway trains below several performance spaces, might appreciate. The Elbphilharmonie?s larger hall is clad with thousands of grooved   panels, the profile of each precisely calculated to optimize resonance. Visually, the effect is stunning, reminiscent of bleached coral or snakeskin, depending on the lighting. On one side of the hall, softly gleaming organ pipes appear like a waterfall. The elegance of this Great Hall finds no reflection in the Small Hall, which opened on Thursday afternoon with a program of chamber music presented by Ensemble Resonanz. Here, too, Mr. Toyota created a minutely modulated acoustic ?skin,? this one carved into sensual waves in oak. The   sound was warm and opulent in works by Georg Friedrich Haas (a premiere, ?Release,? making lavish use of the microtonal shimmies for which this   composer, based in New York, is known) Berg and Bartok. Visually, the rectangular box resembles an oversize sauna. After years of delays and budget increases, which sometimes made it a laughingstock, the Elbphilharmonie is finally open, with music at its center. Judging by the creative zest of the opening events, it is on track to incubate a musical culture as optimistic and striking as the building itself."
17352,Carl Hulse,5/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"WASHINGTON  ?   Majorities in Congress often overreach, but usually not on the very first day. House Republicans, on the verge of a Washington takeover as the new Congress convened Tuesday, couldn?t stop themselves from trying to dilute the power of a despised ethics watchdog as their first order of business. In the process, they created an unsightly spectacle that pretty much ruined an   celebration of unified Republican government, undermined their own leadership and perhaps foretold the shape of things to come. House Republicans take a stand on a contentious issue, Donald J. Trump turns to Twitter to break with House Republicans, then Republicans frantically reverse course. ?Mr. Trump campaigned that he was going to drain the swamp, and here we are on Day 1 trying to fill the swamp,? Representative Walter B. Jones, Republican of North Carolina, said after he and his colleagues hurriedly jettisoned a plan seen as a brazen attempt to weaken an independent ethics office that some felt had been unfair to lawmakers. ?That is not a good way to start. ? Deluged by angry phone calls and bad headlines, chagrined Republican officials say they were well on their way to abandoning the ethics revisions adopted Monday night in a   party meeting before Mr. Trump weighed in via Twitter and suggested that the overhaul shouldn?t be a top priority, urging Republicans to focus instead on taxes and health care. But the final decision did come after the  ?s Twitter posts, underscoring his sway over House Republicans who had moved ahead despite objections and warnings about the optics of the change from Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the majority leader. House Republicans might have amusedly applauded Mr. Trump?s cutting tweets when they were aimed at the news media and other common foes, but they found them measurably less funny when the criticisms were directed their way, raising alarms among Republicans about his power to corral them via social media. Following the decision to reverse course, several lawmakers were quietly fretting that Mr. Trump?s megaphone was much more powerful than they had realized. Other Republicans both on and off Capitol Hill were wondering how the   proposal got as far as it did, given the stated reservations of Mr. Ryan and Mr. McCarthy among others. They said it did not bode well that the rank and file was so willing to ignore leadership on such a potentially critical matter, demonstrating once again how hard it can be to manage the House Republicans even when the party is set to control both Capitol Hill and the White House. Mr. Ryan had already headed off an earlier rules change that was deemed potentially embarrassing: a proposal to let lawmakers resume funding of pet projects through designated ?earmarks? as long as the money went to public entities. Abuse of earmarks was one of the main sources of congressional corruption that led to tighter ethics rules and a ban on such spending, and Mr. Ryan and his allies believed that a quick move to restore them so soon after Mr. Trump?s election would not send the proper signal. But Mr. Ryan has promised to revisit both the earmark issue and the revisions to the Office of Congressional Ethics later this year. The ethics office was created in 2008 at the urging of Representative Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat who was then the House speaker. This was in response to criticism that the Select Committee on Ethics, comprising lawmakers from both parties, was ineffective, given a string of   corruption cases and other breakdowns such as a scandal involving teenage House pages. Lawmakers from both parties were against the office then, as well as now, and would much prefer to be judged by their peers  ?   politicians currently serving in the House who might be more sympathetic  ?   as opposed to a more discrete board and staff. But in moving ahead with the rules change on a strictly partisan basis, Republicans opened the door to Democrats berating them for the proposal, even though a significant number of Democrats are just as unhappy with the ethics office. It was similar to a move House Republicans made in 2005 when they used the   rules package to weaken the ethics committee itself after a series of rebukes against Tom DeLay, the majority leader. That decision sparked an outcry from Democrats and watchdog groups that helped Democrats regain the majority the next year with a message that Republicans were fostering a culture of corruption. ?I think it is always better to do changes to the ethics process in a bipartisan manner,? said John Feehery, a former top Republican aide in the House. ?It protects you from political attacks. ? The tussle over the ethics office is just one illustration of how Mr. Trump and his outsider ideas could clash with his own party in Congress. Mr. Trump has vowed to move forward with a proposal to impose term limits on Congress, and many in the party are not happy with that idea. Other sources of friction are bound to emerge, given his campaign message about shaking up Washington. ?I just could not believe that the Congress does not understand that, if anything, we need to bring sunshine in,? Mr. Jones said. House Republicans may understand that idea a little bit better now."
17885,Dave Itzkoff,24/01/2017,2017,1,business,"Katie Rich, a writer for ?Saturday Night Live,? has been suspended from her position at that show following a widely criticized post she made Friday on her personal Twitter account in which she mocked Barron Trump, the    son of President Donald J. Trump. She was suspended immediately after her tweet, and her suspension is indefinite, according to someone familiar with the plans at ?S. N. L. ,? who was not authorized by NBC to comment on personnel matters. That tweet on Friday, during Mr. Trump?s inauguration ceremony, drew widespread condemnation, and Ms. Rich subsequently deleted the post (which said ?Barron will be this country?s first homeschool shooter?) and deactivated her Twitter account. Her name did not appear in the closing credits of ?Saturday Night Live? in its broadcast on Saturday. On Monday afternoon, Ms. Rich reactivated her account and posted a message that said: ?I sincerely apologize for the insensitive tweet. I deeply regret my actions  offensive words. It was inexcusable  I?m so sorry. ? The suspension of Ms. Rich, who was hired to join ?S. N. L. ? at the end of 2013, comes at a delicate time for the program, when it has felt emboldened to lampoon Mr. Trump but has faced his swift retaliation on Twitter. Following the show?s broadcast of Jan. 14, in which the actor Alec Baldwin played Mr. Trump in a parody of his news conference from earlier that week, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter the following day: ?NBC News is bad but Saturday Night Live is the worst of NBC. Not funny, cast is terrible, always a complete hit job. Really bad television!? Mr. Trump made no public comments about Saturday?s show, in which Mr. Baldwin did not appear. NBC said on Monday that Mr. Baldwin will host ?Saturday Night Live? on Feb. 11 and appear throughout that program."
18243,"Jonathan Weisman, Emmarie Huetteman and Matt Flegenheimer",3/02/2017,2017,2,politics,"? President Trump responded to the failed attack in Paris with his trademark understatement. Europe is not amused. ? The ?Bowling Green massacre? that Kellyanne Conway lamented never happened, but it has triggered another   battle. ? The president?s phone manners apparently have not changed. This time he used them on Uber?s chief executive. A soldier shot and wounded a man wielding a machete near the Louvre museum in Paris, prompting French authorities to open a terrorism investigation. The president of the United States responded: It is difficult to divine Mr. Trump?s thinking at times, but safe to say ?get smart? in this case most likely means accepting his policies. For their part, Europeans aren?t taking well to the new American president. President Fran?ois Hollande of France, in a defense of the European Union that Mr. Trump has disparaged, said on Friday that European countries that wanted to forge bilateral ties with the United States had to ?understand that there is no future with Trump if it is not defined in common. ? Then there are the Germans: When Kellyanne Conway, the White House senior adviser, cited the ?Bowling Green massacre? to justify President Trump?s halt to visas from seven predominantly Muslim countries, America was left scratching its collective head. And social media lit up with delight over the ?massacre? that time forgot. This has not sat well with Ms. Conway, who after all did have a small kernel of truth to back her up, though no killings happened in Bowling Green, Ky. and a ?massacre? does not appear to have ever occurred anywhere. In 2013, the State Department imposed a   freeze on processing Iraqi refugees after two Qaeda members were discovered in Iraq setting roadside bombs targeting American troops. They had been admitted to the United States in 2009 and lived in Bowling Green before they returned to Iraq. The fingerprint that nailed them was on a cellphone detonator tied to a bomb that had not exploded. So ?massacre?? No. In Bowling Green? No. Refugees? Well, yes, sort of. Ms. Conway now says she misspoke. But things got really hot when a Clinton jumped into the fray  ?   Chelsea Clinton. Which only stoked old campaign feuds, and a reminder of the exaggerated claim from Hillary Clinton that, as first lady, she once landed in   Bosnia under fire from hostile Serbs. It never ends. President Trump has taken some heat for his phone manners since it emerged that he pretty much chewed out Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia before hanging up on him. Apparently Mr. Trump is unrepentant. According to the new online newsletter Axios, Mr. Trump had an unpleasant conversation with the chief executive of Uber, Travis Kalanick, after the brash entrepreneur quit  the president?s business council in protest of his executive order banning some foreigners from entering the country. Some in Mr. Trump?s ?inner circle? suggested that Mr. Kalanick was cutting off his access to the White House. Mr. Kalanick might be a little more concerned with all the smartphone users? dropping their Uber app in favor of Lyft, a competitor that was first to protest Mr. Trump?s immigration policies. In an unusual early morning session, the Senate on Friday cleared an important procedural hurdle to approving Betsy DeVos, Mr. Trump?s nominee for education secretary, setting up a final,   confirmation vote next week. The Senate?s    vote along party lines to limit further debate on her nomination is deceptive. Two Republican senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, went along with the procedural vote, but they say they will oppose her on the final vote, expected on Tuesday. Callers have overwhelmed the Capitol?s phone system, many of them expressing angry opposition to Ms. DeVos?s nomination. Senators have heard from all manner of educators in their home states opposing her confirmation  ?   and not just teachers? unions. The opposition from Ms. Collins and Ms. Murkowski raises the prospects of a    tie that Vice President Mike Pence, as president of the Senate, would have to settle. After convening at 6:30 a. m. one of the earliest starts in recent memory, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, urged his colleagues to take stock of their positions on Ms. DeVos?s nomination over the weekend. ?Sometimes loyalty to a president demands a bit too much,? he said on the floor. Why so early? Under Senate rules, a set amount of time had to elapse between the first procedural actions, which took place Wednesday afternoon, and Friday?s vote. Remember Russia? The country that intelligence officials believe interfered in the 2016 presidential election on Mr. Trump?s behalf? Two weeks into Mr. Trump?s presidency, talk of the foreign power?s apparent role has somewhat faded from view, at least temporarily, in the daily avalanche of White House exploits and misadventures. But Capitol Hill will have its say. Two senators are convening an investigation into Russia?s election interference, joining other efforts in Congress to examine what happened. Senators Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, said their investigation would focus on Russian interference both in the United States? election and in other elections around the world. (Mr. Graham is the chairman and Mr. Whitehouse is the ranking member of a subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee that is focused on crime and terrorism.) ?Our goal is simple,? the senators said in a joint statement. ?To the fullest extent possible we want to shine a light on Russian activities to undermine democracy. ? There are already multiple Senate committee examinations into Russia?s role, as well as an inquiry by the House. Dr. Harold N. Bornstein has been President Trump?s personal doctor for more than 35 years. He prescribed Mr. Trump the   drug that keeps the presidential mane flowing, and declared him the healthiest man to hold the highest office in the land. But for now, Mr. Trump will keep the same White House doctor who cared for Barack Obama, Ronny Jackson, a rear admiral in the Navy. The decision, first reported by the online medical journal Stat, raised the possibility that voters might actually get some reliable information on the health of their commander in chief. The meeting of   chief executives at the White House on Friday  ?   people like Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase and Stephen A. Schwarzman of Blackstone  ?   was supposed to prove the bona fides of the new,     . But Mr. Trump?s temporary ban on visas from seven predominantly Muslim countries has complicated the discussion considerably. Travis Kalanick, Uber?s chief executive, told employees he was dropping off Mr. Trump?s economic advisory council in protest of his immigration policies, given the number of immigrant Uber drivers. Bob Iger of Disney is not attending. And Elon Musk let it be known on Twitter that he would object to the ban to the president?s face."
18316,Patrick Kingsley,6/02/2017,2017,2,crime,"ISTANBUL  ?   Several hundred people suspected of being Islamic State operatives were arrested in a series of coordinated raids by the Turkish police on Sunday, in what constitutes one of Turkey?s largest operations against the jihadist group on the country?s soil. Nearly 450 suspects were rounded up in the early hours of Sunday, according to the Anadolu Agency, a   news wire. Independent television reports later said 690 suspects had been held by the end of the day. At least one attack was said to have been thwarted in the process, according to Anadolu. The operation was distinct from crackdowns on those accused of being supporters of last summer?s failed coup, and on members of the country?s political opposition. More than 130, 000 Turks have been arrested or fired from government posts in the past seven months as part of those efforts, according to government data. Sunday?s raids were the latest salvo in a   conflict between Turkey and the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. In the early years of the Syrian revolution, Turkey was accused of turning a blind eye to the movement of thousands of Islamic State fighters over its southern border with Syria, where they joined the war against the forces of the Syrian president, Bashar  . But the Turkish Army is now in direct conflict with the group in northern Syria, where Turkey is leading attempts to expel the Islamic State from the strategically important city of Al Bab. Turkey has suffered numerous attacks linked to the Islamic State since 2014, most recently in the early hours of this year, when a fighter killed 39 people at a nightclub in Istanbul, Turkey?s largest city. The group is also believed to be behind an October 2015 bombing in Ankara, Turkey?s capital, that killed more than 100 people, and was accused of organizing the killing of 45 people at Istanbul?s main airport last summer. This weekend?s raids occurred across an unusually wide area, with suspects seized in 18 provinces. The move is a change in strategy by the Turkish police, who have usually detained only small numbers of jihadists at a time, said Sinan Ulgen, a former Turkish diplomat, and an analyst who focuses on Turkey for Carnegie Europe, a think tank. But the detentions may not necessarily lead to court cases. ?Over all, Turkey?s efforts to combat the influence and network of the Islamic State at home is still handicapped by discrepancies between the different arms of the Turkish state,? Mr. Ulgen said. ?An effort led by law enforcement is sometimes handicapped by the decisions of the Turkish judiciary, which as we have seen in the recent past has let go people associated with the Islamic State. ? Ahmet Yayla, a former counterterrorism chief in Turkey and a critic of the Turkish government, also questioned the effectiveness of such a large raid, which he argued could overwhelm the capacity of the counterterrorism police. Officers may not be able to properly handle the paperwork, interrogations and bureaucracy associated with processing more than 50 suspects, said Dr. Yayla, who headed counterterrorism operations in a southeast Turkish province from 2010 to 2012. ?It is impossible to process that many terrorists in one operation,? said Dr. Yayla, who now lives in the United States, and who began to publicly criticize the Turkish government after his teenage son was jailed on suspicion of a connection to the coup attempt."
17957,Florence Fabricant,26/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"A team of American chefs on Wednesday won the biennial Bocuse d?Or culinary competition  ?   the equivalent of the Olympics for professional cooks  ?   for the first time in the contest?s   history. In the finals in Lyon, France, a group of 10 chefs and helpers from the United States won the gold medal. Norway took the silver medal, and Iceland won the bronze. In 2015 an American team was awarded the silver medal in the competition, which was founded by the French chef Paul Bocuse. Teams from 24 countries competed this year. ?I promised Monsieur Paul 10 years ago that we?d make it to the top of the podium,? said the chef Thomas Keller, who is the president of Team U. S. A. ?We made it in nine. ? The team?s head chef was Mathew Peters, 33, from Meadville, Pa. who was most recently the executive   of Mr. Keller?s New York restaurant, Per Se. His commis, or helper, was Harrison Turone, 21, from Omaha, who also worked at Per Se. Both of the chefs took a year off to prepare for the contest, a fierce competition in which the American team is made up of younger chefs who can spare the time to train. Philip Tessier, a member of the team that won second place in 2015, was the Americans? coach. This year the chefs were required to prepare a meat platter and a vegan dish in 5 hours 35 minutes. ?We had to use two proteins, Bresse chicken and crayfish,? Mr. Peters said. ?And this was the first year there was a vegan dish. ? The teams were required to interpret ?Poulet de Bresse aux crevisses,? a Lyonnaise classic. The American version involved the chicken with morel mushroom sausage, braised wings, a wine glaze and sauce Am?ricaine, a kind of lobster sauce. Alongside were a chicken liver quenelle with foie gras, corn custard,   peas and toasted pistachios, as well as lobster tail with Meyer lemon mousse. The garnishes included preparations using carrots, Vidalia onions, black truffles, carrots, peas and potatoes. They brought some of the ingredients from the United States. For the vegan dish, the chefs prepared California asparagus with cremini mushrooms, potatoes, a custard made of green almonds, Meyer lemon confit, a Bordelaise sauce and a crumble using an almond and vegetable yeast preparation that mimicked Parmesan cheese. The team arrived in Lyon 10 days ago. After the winners were announced at 7:25 p. m. local time, Mr. Peters, who had been cooking since 8:40 a. m. said his energy was starting to come back. An estimated 300 American supporters were in the hall to cheer the team. Unlike some teams, the Americans were supported only by commercial sponsors and contributions, with no government funding. ?I don?t think our government knows who we are,? Mr. Keller said. Mr. Keller said he could not estimate how much participation in the contest cost. But he said that experience was essential. ?We learned along the way,? he said. ?Our win was built on the shoulders of a thousand people. ?"
17924,Mujib Mashal,25/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"KABUL, Afghanistan  ?   The attorney general of Afghanistan has ordered the arrest of nine   bodyguards over accusations of rape and torture made by a political rival, and the vice president himself remains under investigation, officials said on Tuesday. The arrest warrants, confirmed by the attorney general?s office, came after Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, the more senior of Afghanistan?s two vice presidents, and his bodyguards refused to show up for questioning about the allegations, despite repeatedly being summoned by prosecutors. The case is testing the government?s resolve to deliver justice in the face of a potentially dangerous showdown between a powerful former warlord and the shaky coalition administration of which he is a part. Ahmad Ishchi, a    elder from General Dostum?s own Uzbek ethnic group, has accused the vice president of abducting him from a sports stadium in November, personally and repeatedly beating him, and ordering his men to sexually assault him with an assault rifle during five days of captivity in the northern province of Jowzjan. Attorney General Mohammad Farid Hamidi declined to discuss the case in detail on Tuesday but said that his prosecutors were focused on enforcing the law with precision. ?We are following the law in this case hair by hair,? Mr. Hamidi said. President Ashraf Ghani has said that he takes the allegations against General Dostum seriously and that the case will be handled fairly within the judicial system to show that no one is above the law. Mr. Ghani has told Western diplomats that he is tired of officials breaking the law with impunity, and he characterized the Dostum case as a    challenge to his government. But many have said that Mr. Ghani shares the blame for bringing General Dostum onto his ticket in the first place, despite grave concerns about the former warlord?s human rights record. Spokesmen and aides to General Dostum could not be reached for comment about the warrants on Tuesday, but in recent weeks, they have rejected the summons against him as unconstitutional. Bashir Ahmad Tayanj, a spokesman for General Dostum, said last month that the allegations were baseless and that the vice president had constitutional immunity from prosecution as part of the president?s elected ticket. In recent weeks, however, senior government officials say General Dostum?s aides have been in contact with the attorney general?s office, where they have been clearly told that the vice president has no choice but to cooperate. The general?s aides have asked for time, two senior officials said. Mr. Ishchi welcomed the news of the warrants and insisted that the bodyguards be arrested immediately. But he said justice would only be served once General Dostum?s fate had been made clear. ?Dostum committed an obvious crime, and when the crime is evident, the government can arrest the criminal even if he is a very   person,? he said. General Dostum is part of a generation of Afghan warlords who stand accused of human rights violations, mostly during the country?s civil war in the 1990s. But until now, most of those figures have seemed immune to the consequences, remaining in positions of power. Before issuing the summons for General Dostum, the attorney general sought the support of Mr. Ghani and the national security council, which includes all the security ministries. A detailed plan of action was discussed at a meeting of the council, at which all the agencies pledged support for the prosecutors. General Dostum?s supporters have insisted that Mr. Ishchi was not abducted but, rather, arrested by security forces on charges of aiding the Taliban in Jowzjan Province. ?Force, injury, and mistreatment  ?   we cannot deny that, because in the past these accusations have been there against Afghan forces, that they mistreat suspects during arrest and interrogation,? Mr. Tayanj said in the interview last month. But he denied the accusation of sexual assault. Both sides have also made emotional appeals to the public on the nightly news. On one news program, Mr. Tayanj presented a medical document that he said was from a government forensics examination he said it disproved Mr. Ishchi?s assertions of sexual assault but did not go into detail, simply brandishing the paper. A day later, Mr. Tayanj allowed two New York Times reporters to examine the document. It stated that there had been a wound next to Mr. Ishchi?s rectum but that it had been treated, making it difficult to determine what had caused it. Two other medical reports seen by The Times also attest to the presence of a significant wound. One was written by doctors at the United States military air base in Bagram, the other by doctors at the   Wazir Akbar Khan hospital, in Kabul. When the reporters pressed Mr. Tayanj about the wound, he said it was not evidence of sexual assault. ?If someone hits someone with a rifle, no matter where they hit, is that sexual assault? Sexual assault has its own specific meaning,? Mr. Tayanj said. ?They have made it seem as if he was an    girl who was taken and done something wrong to. ? Aides to General Dostum have called for traditional mediation by tribal elders to resolve the issue, flatly rejecting the judicial process. He is also said to have sent a delegation of elders to negotiate with Mr. Ishchi. Baktash Ishchi, one of Mr. Ishchi?s sons, said that they insisted on following the legal process and would not engage in traditional mediation. ?This is not an issue for traditional mediation  ?   it is not like he took our camel, so we accept a horse in return,? he said. ?There is a crime that has taken place. ?"
17557,Nicholas Fandos,12/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"Times reporters provided   analysis and fact checks of   Donald J. Trump?s news conference.   Donald J. Trump made an important concession about Russia. He criticized American intelligence officials. He sparred with reporters and denounced ?fake news. ? And that was all before he arrived at the ostensible reason for holding his first formal news conference since July: his plans to extricate himself from the operations of his vast business holdings. Here are the highlights from the whirling, hourlong news conference inside Trump Tower. ? Mr. Trump said that after his briefing on Friday with American intelligence officials, he now thought Russia was behind the effort to hack his election opponents. ?As far as hacking, I think it was Russia,? Mr. Trump said. ? However, later in the news conference, Mr. Trump wavered slightly when pressed on the matter. ?But you know what, it could have been others also,? he said when asked why he had been so critical of American intelligence officials. ? He harshly criticized the publication of unverified reports that claimed Russia has salacious information about his behavior and finances. ?I think it was disgraceful, disgraceful that the intelligence agencies let any information that turned out to be so false and fake out,? he said. Explaining his Twitter post comparing the United States to Nazi Germany, he said of the leaks: ?That?s something that Nazi Germany would have done and did do. ? Mr. Trump added that BuzzFeed, which published the memos in their entirety, is ?a failing pile of garbage? that would suffer the consequences for publishing the uncorroborated report. ? Mr. Trump said he was untroubled by other intelligence reports that have been made public, which said Russia preferred him over Hillary Clinton and that President Vladimir V. Putin ordered the election meddling to benefit him. ?If Putin likes Donald Trump, guess what, folks: That is called an asset, not a liability,? he said. He added that a strong relationship could allow the two nations to work together on difficult international issues. ? When asked whether he had a message for Mr. Putin, Mr. Trump said: ?He shouldn?t be doing it. He won?t be doing it. Russia will have much greater respect for our country when I am leading it. ? He added: ?There?s no reset button. We?re either going to get along or we?re not. ? But he did not address a question about whether he or anyone on his campaign staff had had contact with Russia during the campaign. ? Mr. Trump swatted away allegations included in the uncorroborated reports. He said that, when traveling, he warns his aides and bodyguards, ?Be very careful, because in your hotel rooms and no matter where you go, you?re gonna probably have cameras. ? He also added, apparently referring to a detail in the report about supposed sex videos with prostitutes, ?I?m also very much of a germaphobe, believe me. ? ? Discussing the topic the news conference was intended to address, Mr. Trump said he would not divest from his vast business holdings as he takes office. Instead, the   will turn over the operations and control of those holdings to a trust controlled by his eldest sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. ? The   said that he had considered letting the Affordable Care Act ?implode? on its own and letting Democrats take the political hit he said would follow. But he said he had decided on a more forthright strategy: repeal and replace ?almost simultaneously. ? Mr. Trump was short on details but clearer in his intention to try to keep Democrats responsible. ?We don?t want to own it politically,? he said. ? Mr. Trump said that he had asked David J. Shulkin, a current under secretary at the Department of Veterans Affairs, to lead that agency after his team had interviewed ?at least 100 people? in the search for a secretary. ? Near the end of the news conference, Mr. Trump got into a shouting match with Jim Acosta of CNN, who tried to press the   into taking a question. ?Since you were attacking our news organization, can you give us a chance?? Mr. Acosta asked. To which Mr. Trump replied: ?Your organization?s terrible,? and ?don?t be rude,? before dismissing the request once and for all: ?You are fake news. ? (CNN was the first to report that Mr. Trump and President Obama had been briefed by intelligence officials on the uncorroborated documents, but the network did not publish them.) ? Sean Spicer, the incoming White House press secretary, spoke first to address the publication of the unverified reports by BuzzFeed on Tuesday. Mr. Spicer called the reports a ?frankly outrageous and highly irresponsible? attack on Mr. Trump and a ?sad, pathetic attempt to get clicks. ? Mr. Spicer said the documents were not an intelligence report and were categorically false. ? Vice   Mike Pence followed Mr. Spicer and amplified his condemnation of news reports by BuzzFeed and other news outlets, which he said were ?irresponsible? and aimed at discrediting Mr. Trump?s legitimate election victory. ? Mr. Trump began by thanking news organizations that did not report what he called ?the nonsense that was released. ? He said he has ?great respect for freedom of the press, and all of that. ? ? Mr. Trump said that the document ?was released by maybe the intelligence agencies, who knows, which would be a tremendous blot on their record. ? ? He went on to cast blame on the Democratic National Committee for the hacking. He praised the Republican National Committee for having better defenses and commended Reince Priebus, his incoming chief of staff, who was the committee chairman. ? Mr. Trump reiterated his description of the report printed by BuzzFeed as ?fake news,? saying he did not think Mr. Putin had compromising information about him or the Republican Party. ?I?ll be honest, if he did have something, he would have released it,? he said. ? He denied that he has any business dealings in Russia: ?I tweeted out that I have no dealings with Russia. I have no deals in Russia. I have no deals that could happen in Russia because we?ve stayed away. And I have no loans with Russia. As a real estate developer, I have very, very little debt. ? ? Mr. Trump said he had requested that the intelligence agencies produce a ?major report? on ?hacking defense? to be delivered 90 days after he takes office, including an examination of ?this situation? with Russia and other incidents of hacking. ? Sheri A. Dillon, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, took the stage to describe how her client would turn over his business assets to a trust. ?  Trump wants there to be no doubt in the minds of the American public that he is completely isolating himself from his business interests,? she said, adding that Mr. Trump?s sons will make all decisions for the company ?without any involvement whatsoever? from Mr. Trump. She said Mr. Trump would resign from all positions he holds with the Trump Organization, as would his daughter Ivanka. ? Ms. Dillon said that the Trump Organization would be allowed to make no new foreign deals during the presidency and that any new domestic deals would be subject to strict restrictions. ?He will only know of a deal if he reads about it in the paper or sees it on TV,? Ms. Dillon said, referring to Mr. Trump. She also said an ethics adviser would be appointed to the management team of the Trump Organization. ? Ms. Dillon argued that selling Mr. Trump?s business would prove more difficult and create more ethical quandaries than the plan that the Trump Organization had chosen. A totally blind trust, she said, would likewise be impossible under the circumstances. And, she added, ?  Trump should not be expected to destroy the company he built. ? ? Ms. Dillon laid out what amounts to the Trump administration?s interpretation of the Constitution?s Emoluments Clause, which prohibits government officials from taking payments or gifts from a foreign government. ?No one would have thought when the Constitution was written, that paying your hotel bill was an emolument,? she said. To avoid any appearances of violations, Ms. Dillon said Mr. Trump had pledged to donate to the United States government all profits made by his hotels from payments by foreign governments. ? Mr. Trump was flanked by a table piled high with manila folders that he said contained paperwork that he had signed turning over control of the Trump Organization to his sons. ? Mr. Trump joked that if his sons failed to do a good job managing the company during his time in office, he would turn to them and say, ?You?re fired. ? ? In other comments about his businesses, Mr. Trump said he had been offered deals worth $2 billion worth in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, ?over the weekend? but had turned them down. ? Asked about his tax returns, Mr. Trump said he was still not releasing them ?because they are under audit. ? He said that the American people did not care about the documents anyway. ?The only one that cares about my tax returns are the reporters,? Mr. Trump said. ? Mr. Trump said he was looking forward to his inauguration. ?It?s going to be a beautiful event,? he said. ?We have great talent, tremendous talent. ? And, he added, ?massive crowds? as well. ? Asked to address criticism that his cabinet choices have presented an abundance of conflicts of interest, Mr. Trump simply praised his appointments. ?I think we have one of the great cabinets ever put together,? he said. ? Mr. Trump said he expected to announce ?big news? in the next few weeks about companies that would build factories in the Midwest. ? Mr. Trump said Carrier?s decision to keep jobs in Indiana sent a clear signal to other companies thinking of moving production overseas. ?The word is now out,? he said, repeating a call for a ?major border tax on these companies that are leaving. ? ? About that wall: ?I don?t feel like waiting a year, a year and a half I want to start building,? he said. He reiterated that Mexico would reimburse the cost, but he added cryptically that it probably wouldn?t be in the form of ?a payment. ? ? Turning to the Supreme Court, Mr. Trump said he expected to announce a nominee to fill the court?s vacant seat two weeks or so after he takes office. ? Mr. Trump was asked how he would reform the news media he criticizes frequently. ?I don?t recommend reforms,? he said. ?I recommend people that have some moral compass. ? He added, ?I will tell you, some of the media outlets that I deal with are fake news, more so than anybody. ?"
18238,"Nicholas Kulish, Caitlin Dickerson and Charlie Savage",4/02/2017,2017,2,law,"A federal judge in Seattle on Friday temporarily blocked President Trump?s   immigration order from being enforced nationwide, reopening America?s door to visa holders from seven predominantly Muslim countries and dealing the administration a humbling defeat. The White House vowed late Friday to fight what it called an ?outrageous? ruling, saying it would seek an emergency halt to the judge?s order as soon as possible and restore the president?s ?lawful and appropriate order. ? ?The president?s order is intended to protect the homeland and he has the constitutional authority and responsibility to protect the American people,? the White House said. A revised statement released later omitted the word ?outrageous. ? And early Saturday morning, Mr. Trump tweeted in defense of his stand. Courts around the country have halted aspects of Mr. Trump?s temporary ban on travel from the seven countries, but the Seattle ruling was the most   to date. Airlines that had been stopping travelers from boarding planes to the United States were told by the government in a conference call Friday night to begin allowing them to fly, according to a person familiar with the call but who declined to be identified because it was a private discussion. The Trump administration, however, could again block the travelers if it were to win an emergency stay. The federal government was ?arguing that we have to protect the U. S. from individuals from these countries, and there?s no support for that,? said the judge, James Robart of Federal District Court for the Western District of Washington, an appointee of President George W. Bush, in a decision delivered from the bench. The judge?s ruling was temporary, putting Mr. Trump?s policy on hold at least until the government and opponents of the order had a chance to make full arguments, or until the administration won a stay. ?What we?re seeing here is the courts standing up to the unconstitutional ban that President Trump imposed,? said Omar Jadwat, director of the Immigrants? Rights Project at the A. C. L. U. ?There?s obviously more litigation to come, but this is truly good news for the many people both in this country and abroad who have been unfairly targeted on the basis of their religion by this ban. ? It is not unusual for district courts to issue nationwide injunctions blocking executive actions, and the federal government must obey such injunctions even when other district courts have declined to issue injunctions in similar cases. Judge Robart temporarily barred the administration from enforcing two parts of Mr. Trump?s order: its   suspension of entry into the United States of people from the seven countries  ?   Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen  ?   and its limits on accepting refugees, including ?any action that prioritizes the refugee claims of certain religious minorities. ? The order had suspended admissions of any refugees for 120 days, and of Syrian refugees indefinitely. The goal, the president said, was to evaluate the process for vetting refugees and other immigrants in order to safeguard the country against terrorism. The order said that when immigration from the seven countries resumed, persecuted religious minorities would be given preference, and in an interview the day of the signing, Mr. Trump said the United States would give Christians from those countries priority because they had suffered ?more so than others. ? Judge Robart made clear that his order applied nationwide, citing a similar nationwide injunction from a federal district court in Texas that had blocked President Barack Obama?s plan to shield some undocumented immigrants from deportation and allow them to legally work in the United States. Since Mr. Trump signed his order on Jan. 27, there has been widespread confusion over the policy and disagreement over how it was being carried out, flummoxing immigration lawyers, government officials and travelers. Shortly before the Seattle ruling, a different federal judge, Nathaniel M. Gorton in Boston, ruled in favor of the government by declining to extend a temporary halt to the order in that jurisdiction. Judge Gorton, who was appointed to the bench by the first President George Bush, said that while the nation?s immigration history was a source of great pride and that the plaintiffs in that case  ?   Iranian nationals who are academics  ?   had compelling stories, ?the public interest in safety and security in this ever more dangerous world is strong as well. ? But that ruling was soon rendered moot, at least for now, by the Seattle ruling. The administration has been criticized for issuing its order without any warning to refugees and visa holders who were on their way to the United States. Some arrived at airports for flights and were turned away. The president?s order allowed for exceptions in the ?national interest,? but lawyers for some travelers had described getting one as a Kafkaesque exercise, with the State Department?s website warning that no emergency applications would be heard, and Customs and Border Protection agents at United States airports all but unreachable because their clients were not being allowed to board planes. ?It?s quite clear it was not all that thought out,? Judge Leonie Brinkema of Federal District Court in Alexandria, Va. said in yet another court hearing held Friday. ?As a result there has been chaos. ? Protests over the policy continued on Friday, including a large group that gathered in a parking lot of Kennedy International Airport in New York for the Friday Prayer. One big question surrounded the number of people who were affected by the travel ban. Besides barring refugees and other visa holders from the seven countries from entering the United States, the administration also revoked, at least temporarily, all visas from the seven countries, including those for people currently living in the United States. The revocations, which were not publicly announced but were revealed during court proceedings, meant that anyone who lost their visa would be unable to   the United States if they left. In the Virginia courtroom, spectators gasped when a lawyer for the government told Judge Brinkema, an appointee of President Bill Clinton, that more than 100, 000 visas had been revoked as part of Mr. Trump?s order. A State Department official later contradicted that number, saying that it mistakenly included diplomatic visas that were untouched by the ban as well as expired visas. The true figure was ?fewer than 60, 000,? said William Cocks, a spokesman for the department?s Bureau of Consular Affairs. ?To put that number in context, we issued over 11 million immigrant and nonimmigrant visas in fiscal year 2015,? he said in a statement. Because the court fights so far have centered on whether judges should impose and keep in place temporary restraining orders, the legal arguments in the last few days have centered on the government?s contention that there is ?no potential irreparable harm? to justify keeping the extraordinary orders in place pending fuller briefing and arguments. But Bob Ferguson, the Washington attorney general, who opposed the Trump administration in the Seattle case, said the decision Friday ?shuts down the executive order nationwide and immediately. ? ?I hope the federal government will understand what they did was unconstitutional and unlawful,? he said."
18339,Jon Pareles,6/02/2017,2017,2,entertainment,"Picking the pain reliever that?s best for you can be a confusing task. Pharmacy and supermarket shelves are lined with a dizzying array of boxes, names and labels describing the symptoms the medications are intended to address. While they all share the same goal, making you feel better, their active ingredients vary, and all have potential drawbacks. Dr. Robert A. Duarte, director of the Pain Center at Northwell Health in Great Neck, N. Y. cautioned that consumers should not be lulled into thinking that    pain relievers are free from potential harm just because they are available on store shelves. Sales of    medications exceeded $30 billion in 2015, with pain relievers ranking near the top, according to industry statistics. Consumers need to be informed about what they are taking, and in what doses. A survey conducted in 2001 for the National Council on Patient Information and Education found that only   of those polled could identify the active ingredient in their pain reliever. A similar fraction of consumers said they had taken more than the recommended dose of nonprescription medication because they believed it would increase its effectiveness. Dr. Sadiah Siddiqui, an anesthesiologist specializing in interventional pain medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine in Manhattan, said consumers need to read the labels of the medications for their active ingredients. Those who take any kind of    pain reliever around the clock for a week or more should see a specialist or their doctor, she added. Here are the major categories of nonprescription pain relievers and some of what you should know about them: Common brand name: Tylenol Recommended to treat: Headaches, pain and fever Potential side effects:The Food and Drug Administration recommends a maximum of 4, 000 milligrams per day. Exceeding that level can mean the liver has to work harder. Clinicians recommend a daily maximum dose of 3, 000 if it is taken for an extended period. What else you should know: Concerns about potential liver damage from taking acetaminophen have been clouded over time, Dr. Duarte said. The warnings surfaced because patients were taking Tylenol with other    medications or prescriptions that also contained acetaminophen. For instance, the prescription painkiller Percocet and    cold and flu remedies have Tylenol in them. When patients take those drugs as well as Tylenol, they can unwittingly get higher doses of acetaminophen than they should, he said. ?You may not think you are taking that much Tylenol, but yes you are,? he said. Common brand names: Advil, Motrin Recommended to treat: Arthritic, joint and dental pain and headaches Potential side effects: Stomach bleeding and kidney problems are risks, particularly for patients who are 60 or older, Dr. Duarte said. What else you should know: Ibuprofen is an   that combats prostaglandins, the chemicals associated with pain such as menstrual cramps, joint pain and headaches that are released in the body. Common brand names: Bayer and St. Joseph. It is also found in Excedrin. Recommended to treat: Headaches and pain from inflammation. It is also used to prevent strokes and promote heart health. Potential side effects: Gastric bleeding and kidney dysfunction children up to their   years should not take aspirin because it is linked to Reye syndrome, which causes brain and liver damage. What else you should know: When it comes to Excedrin and Excedrin for migraines, opt for the less expensive basic product because they both have the same active ingredients, Dr. Duarte said, adding, ?Don?t be fooled by packaging. ? In general, he said, regardless of what product you take, don?t think that if some is good, more is better. If you have an underlying history of headaches and you are regularly taking    pain relievers, you can be at risk of a ?rebound headache? caused by the drugs wearing off and the onset of another headache. Some natural products, such as magnesium (400 to 600 milligrams a day) or riboflavin (400 milligrams a day) or using aromatherapy with peppermint oil can help with migraines and muscle pain, he said. Patients should discuss all the medications they take with their doctor. ?A simple    in fact, has risks just the way a prescription does,? Dr. Duarte said. ?A lot of the patients don?t take these medications seriously. ?"
17908,Karen Zraick and Sandra Stevenson,24/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here?s the  .) Good evening. Here?s the latest. 1. President Trump is quickly dismantling   policies. He revived two blocked pipeline projects: the Keystone XL pipeline, the focus of years of debate over energy needs and climate change and the Dakota Access pipeline, the target of intense Native American protests. Mr. Trump also pressed automakers to increase jobs in the U. S. But a new forecast of a federal budget deficit that could expand to almost $10 trillion over 10 years could complicate his agenda to slash taxes and ramp up spending. And the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, stood by Mr. Trump?s repetition of the false claim that only millions of illegal votes by undocumented immigrants cost him the popular vote. _____  2. On Capitol Hill, Mr. Trump?s pick to be secretary of health and human services, Representative Tom Price of Georgia, defended his investments in an Australian pharmaceutical company. And James Comey, above, told top agents that he?d been asked to remain as head of the F. B. I. averting another potentially bruising confirmation battle. It?s a delicate time for the intelligence community, which is looking into ties between Mr. Trump?s associates  ?   including his former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort  ?   and Russia. Mr. Trump said he?d name his Supreme Court pick next week. The top contenders are conservatives on federal appeals courts: William Pryor Jr. known for his opposition to abortion and gay rights, and Neil Gorsuch, more distinguished by credentials, erudition and relatively muted stances. _____ 3. This year?s Oscar nominations are out. Voters gave ?La La Land? 14 nominations, a tie for the most in Academy Award history. The academy also honored six black actors  ?   a record. They included Denzel Washington and Viola Davis for their roles in ?Fences,? above. Here is the full list of nominees our critics? rundown of surprises and snubs reactions from some of the nominees a form to complete your own ballot and a guide on how to stream the nominated movies. _____ 4. Israel, discarding diplomatic restraint just a few days into the Trump administration, approved the construction of 2, 500 housing units in West Bank settlements. A month ago, the Obama administration declined to veto a Security Council resolution that condemned Israeli settlements as a ?flagrant violation of international law,? and a week ago, a gathering of world leaders warned Israel to stop expanding them. _____ 5. Two days of talks in Kazakhstan on the Syrian war concluded with an agreement by Iran, Russia and Turkey to enforce a partial  . But they didn?t say how, and none of the Syrians at the conference  ?   neither the government, nor the rebels, above  ?   signed the agreement, and the main result was solidifying Russia?s role in the diplomacy. _____ 6. The Manhattan jail holding the notorious drug lord known as El Chapo is said to be tougher than Guantÿnamo. A remarkable figure in the annals of crime history, with two escapes from   Mexican prisons, he was extradited to the U. S. last week. The lights are on almost 24 hours a day, security is extraordinarily stringent, and the most closely guarded prisoners are denied almost all human contact. But it has seen several successful escapes. _____ 7. The expensive wonder drugs approved in recent years to cure hepatitis C, which can lead to liver disease and cancer, offered the hope of resolving a huge public health problem in the U. S. and around the world. But a report coming out Wednesday warns of the possibility of serious side effects, including liver failure, and doctors said the issue warranted further study. The news set off a new round of debate over the risks of expedited approval for badly needed drugs. ?Benefits and side effects evolve over the long term, not over 12 weeks,? an author of the study said. _____ 8. Burning dinner might seem like a mistake. But the art of strategic charring, browning and blackening has deep roots in many cuisines. Exercised with care, it can conjure a world of flavor. Chefs are embracing the technique. Consider moles made with charred and   ingredients, above, blackened avocado and, mmm, lamb heart ashes. _____ 9. Houston is preparing to welcome the Super Bowl on Feb. 5, and its leaders are eager to show off the makeover the city has undergone since it last hosted the game more than a decade ago. A hub for the oil and gas industries and the nation?s   city, Houston is on the upswing, boasting an array of new restaurants,   green space, and cultural and entertainment venues. _____ 10. On the move? Our travel writer reviewed several meditation apps that have sessions for use on planes, trains  ?   even your daily commute. One is called ?OMG. I Can Meditate!? Another offers the affirming reminder: ?The more our mind learns about itself, the stronger it becomes. ? As we?ve said before about mindfulness exercises: Hey, it can?t hurt. _____ 11. Finally, there are many ways to look at history. We?re gauging it through antique lace: our 165 years of wedding reporting. The project?s first installment focuses on the subjects of The Times?s first wedding announcement, on Sept. 18, 1851, Sarah Mullett and John Grant. And, amazingly, generations of their descendants, who gather every year for a family photo with the ancestral portraits. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.
