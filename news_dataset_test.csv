17742,Claire Cain Miller,19/01/2017,2017,1,lifestyle,"To be a woman in the United States is to feel unequal, despite great strides in gender equality, according to a   poll about gender in postelection America released Tuesday. It?s catcalls on the street, disrespect at work and unbalanced responsibilities at home. For girls, it?s being taught, more than boys, to aspire to marriage, and for women, it?s watching positions of power go to men. Men, however, don?t necessarily see it that way. Those are some of the findings from the poll, by PerryUndem, a nonpartisan research and polling firm whose biggest clients are foundations. It surveyed 1, 302 adults in December via the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago?s AmeriSpeak panel.   percent of women said sexism was a problem in society today, and 41 percent of women said they had felt unequal because of their gender. Men underestimated the sexism felt by the women in their lives, the survey found. And while most respondents agreed it?s a better time to be a man than a woman in our society, only Republican men thought it was a better time to be a woman than a man. As women across the nation prepare to march in protest of an election in which gender loomed large, the poll results reveal nearly unanimous support for gender equality and policies that would help women  ?   but deep partisan divides in the perception of inequality and of who?s thriving and who?s losing in society. Many Americans seemed to think others had it better than they did, especially Republican men. Over all, only 37 percent of respondents thought it was a good time to be a woman in the United States. Fewer thought it was a good time to be a minority woman 24 percent said it was a good time to be a Latina, and 11 percent a Muslim woman. Republican men seem to see it differently. Just over half thought it was a good time to be a woman, while only 41 percent of them thought it was a good time to be a man. Donald J. Trump?s rhetoric has appealed to people who feel this way. At his victory rally in Cincinnati last month, he said about women: ?I hate to tell you men, generally speaking, they?re better than you are. Now, if I said it the other way around, I?d be in big trouble. ? Dennis Halaszynski, 81, is a retired police captain in McKeesport, Pa. and a registered Democrat who voted for Mr. Trump. ?It?s easier being a woman today than it is a man,? he said in an interview. ?The white man is a low person on the totem pole. Everybody else is above the white man. ? Women ?should be highly respected,? he said, but they are no longer unequal: ?Everything in general is in favor of a woman. No matter what happens in life, it seems like the man?s always at fault. ? Democrats of both genders were much more likely to have felt unequal because of some aspect of their identity  ?   68 percent, compared with 47 percent of Republicans. Gender, race and religious views were the biggest reasons. The only reasons Republicans were more likely than Democrats to feel unequal were their religious views and military status. There is overwhelming support for gender equality in work, life and politics: 93 percent of respondents said they believed in it. But 43 percent of male Trump voters said it had already been achieved. Only 20 percent of those polled and 12 percent of women agreed. The disparity is partly because people define equality very differently, based on their politics and gender. A majority of respondents said the following things affected women?s rights and equality: unequal responsibilities caring for children violence against women a focus on women?s beauty and sexuality the lack of women in political office and positions of power sexism racism equal opportunities in the workplace and access to birth control and abortion. But in almost every instance, Republican men had a different view. For example, 51 percent of respondents but 24 percent of Republican men said a lack of women in political office affected women?s rights.   percent of respondents over all and 36 percent of Republican men said unequal responsibilities caring for family affected women?s rights. Even men who said women were still treated unequally underestimated the sexism that women experience. While 41 percent of women said they frequently or sometimes heard sexist language in their daily lives, 26 percent of men thought their partners did.   percent of women said they had been touched by a man in an inappropriate way without consent, while 31 percent of men thought their partners had. ?The typical catcalling or comments or inappropriate gestures that men make toward you, I don?t think there?s any women who haven?t experienced that sort of harassment,? said Cristina Hall, 44, who works in customer service in San Diego. But she was not surprised that men didn?t realize it. ?I think when people don?t go through certain experiences, it?s hard for them to understand that it even happens,? Ms. Hall said. ?Maybe they?ve never done it to a woman. Plus as women, we don?t typically say anything because of fear we?re not going to be believed or retaliation or shame. ? About 40 percent of women said acts of sexism would be more likely because Mr. Trump won, including sexual assault and feelings of entitlement among men to treat women as sexual objects. About a third of respondents said they were less tolerant of sexism in their own lives as a result of Mr. Trump?s victory, and 43 percent of parents said it made them teach their children about sexual assault and consent. ?People seem to feel validated in their racist and sexist beliefs right now,? said Tayler Lien, 22, a   college student in Las Vegas who voted for Hillary Clinton. ?It?s a little bit scary. ? There was widespread support among large majorities in both parties for policies that would help women, like equal pay and paid leave. These have been rallying cries for feminists and progressives, and Republicans have traditionally opposed them. Congress failed to act on those policies during the Obama administration, but Mr. Trump has said he would push for them. Ninety percent of the respondents and 86 percent of Republicans supported the idea that the next president and Congress should work on equal pay laws.   percent of respondents supported policies improving access to   affordable child care, and 87 percent supported paid family and medical leave. Policies concerning reproductive rights were the exception to the bipartisan support.   percent of Republicans and 82 percent of Democrats said they supported work toward protecting a woman?s right to abortion from the next president and Congress, and 40 percent of Republicans and 80 percent of Democrats opposed getting rid of the part of Obamacare that offers birth control without a  . Peg Cherry, 83, a lifelong Republican who voted for Mr. Trump, said only     jobs were available when she was young. She worked   in retail and elder care jobs while raising five daughters. All five worked  ?   ?a feather in my cap,? she said  ?   and so she supports policies like equal pay and paid leave. She thinks Mr. Trump will deliver. ?I think he?s going to put his money where his mouth is,? said Ms. Cherry, who lives in Lisbon Falls, Me. ?I think he?s more likely to because, look, he?s had his daughter in charge of a company and he could very well put a man in there. ? Ms. Cherry is not the only one pinning her hopes on Ivanka Trump for   policies.   percent of people, including the majority of Democrats, said they wanted her to help push forward on women?s rights and equality. Despite the widespread support for gender equality and certain feminist policies, only 19 percent of respondents said they considered themselves feminists. There was no clear consensus on who best represented feminism today. The largest shares of people, both women and men, named two black women: Michelle Obama and Oprah Winfrey."
17906,Nicholas Fandos,25/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"WASHINGTON  ?   During a private meeting with congressional leaders on Monday, President Trump asserted that between three million and five million unauthorized immigrants had voted for his Democratic opponent and robbed him of a victory in the national popular vote. There is no evidence to support the claim, which has been discredited repeatedly by numerous  . That did not stop Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, from standing by the president?s words on Tuesday during a briefing with reporters at the White House. ?As I said, I think the president has believed that for a while based on studies and information he has,? Mr. Spicer said. That much appears to be true. Mr. Trump repeatedly raised doubts about the integrity of the American voting system in the period before the election in November and has falsely said since his victory that millions of people voted illegally. Pressed to present the evidence on Tuesday, Mr. Spicer appeared to conflate two different studies that Mr. Trump?s staff had previously cited in defending his claim. ?There?s one that came out of Pew in 2008 that showed 14 percent of people who voted were noncitizens,? Mr. Spicer said. ?There?s other studies that have been presented to him. ? Neither study Mr. Spicer apparently referred to supports Mr. Trump?s claim. The first study was conducted in 2014 by professors at Old Dominion University and discussed on Monkey Cage, a blog hosted by The Washington Post. Using data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, the researchers found that 14 percent of noncitizens who responded to the survey in 2008 and 2010 said they were registered to vote. The problem is that the study relied on flawed data and was roundly criticized by political scientists who said that a more careful examination of the data revealed no evidence that noncitizens had voted in recent elections. The second study, conducted in 2012 by the Pew Center on the States, found that 24 million voter registrations were no longer valid or ?significantly inaccurate? that more than 1. 8 million dead people were still listed on the voter rolls and that almost three million were registered in multiple states, probably because they had moved from one state to another. The study did not find evidence that those errors led to voter fraud, however, simply that they presented avoidable costs and inefficiencies in the electoral process. The primary author of the study, David Becker, made that plain in a Twitter post in November. On Tuesday, he wrote on Twitter that voting integrity in the November election had in fact improved. The absence of studies supporting the claim is not all that is working against Mr. Trump. Election and law enforcement officials all over the country, who monitored reports of voter fraud state by state, have said they found no credible evidence of widespread fraud. Mr. Trump?s assertion likewise found little backing from his Republican colleagues on Capitol Hill. ?I?ve seen no evidence to that effect,? House Speaker Paul D. Ryan told reporters on Monday when asked about the purported voter fraud. In an interview with CNN, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, urged Mr. Trump to ?knock this off. ? ?This is going to erode his ability to govern this country if he does not stop it,? Mr. Graham said, adding that the president needed to present evidence for his beliefs if he was going to continue to profess them. Others simply deflected questions about Mr. Trump?s claims. Asked about the accuracy of the president?s assessment, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, chose to answer a question no one had asked. ?It does occur,? he said of voter fraud, declining to quantify the scope. ?There are always arguments on both sides about how much, how frequent and all the rest. ?"
18285,The Associated Press,5/02/2017,2017,2,sports,"HOUSTON  ?   Atlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan was named the N. F. L. ?s most valuable player on Saturday, 24 hours before he was to try to cap his superb season with Super Bowl glory. Ryan, 31, got his first M. V. P. Award by collecting 25 of the votes while his opposite number in Sunday?s Super Bowl, the New England Patriots? Tom Brady, finished with 10. Brady has won the award twice, for the 2007 and 2010 seasons. Ryan?s award came after a dazzling season for Atlanta?s offense in which he finished with 4, 944 passing yards, 38 touchdowns and only seven interceptions. Super Bowl LI on Sunday will be his first appearance in the title game. Brady, who is chasing his fifth Super Bowl victory, finished the season with 3, 554 passing yards, 28 touchdowns and two interceptions but played in four fewer games than Ryan because of his Deflategate suspension. Unsurprisingly, Ryan also picked up the Offensive Player of the Year Award. Ryan had the best season of his career after spending last summer working intensively on his throwing motion at a Los Angeles training camp. He averaged slightly over nine yards per pass, the highest rate ever for a quarterback with more than 400 completions in a season. The Defensive Player of the Year Award went to the Oakland Raiders? Khalil Mack, whose season included 11 sacks, five forced fumbles, three fumble recoveries and an interception returned for a touchdown as the Raiders reached the playoffs. Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott was a surprise pick, ahead of his teammate Ezekiel Elliott, for offensive rookie of the year. Prescott, who played the entire season for Dallas after Tony Romo injured his back in the preseason, drew 28 of 50 votes, beating out Elliott, who finished as the   with 21 votes. The Cowboys, who were beaten in their opening playoff game by the Green Bay Packers after finishing the regular season at   also saw their coach, Jason Garrett, pick up coach of the year honors."
17557,Nicholas Fandos,12/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"Times reporters provided   analysis and fact checks of   Donald J. Trump?s news conference.   Donald J. Trump made an important concession about Russia. He criticized American intelligence officials. He sparred with reporters and denounced ?fake news. ? And that was all before he arrived at the ostensible reason for holding his first formal news conference since July: his plans to extricate himself from the operations of his vast business holdings. Here are the highlights from the whirling, hourlong news conference inside Trump Tower. ? Mr. Trump said that after his briefing on Friday with American intelligence officials, he now thought Russia was behind the effort to hack his election opponents. ?As far as hacking, I think it was Russia,? Mr. Trump said. ? However, later in the news conference, Mr. Trump wavered slightly when pressed on the matter. ?But you know what, it could have been others also,? he said when asked why he had been so critical of American intelligence officials. ? He harshly criticized the publication of unverified reports that claimed Russia has salacious information about his behavior and finances. ?I think it was disgraceful, disgraceful that the intelligence agencies let any information that turned out to be so false and fake out,? he said. Explaining his Twitter post comparing the United States to Nazi Germany, he said of the leaks: ?That?s something that Nazi Germany would have done and did do. ? Mr. Trump added that BuzzFeed, which published the memos in their entirety, is ?a failing pile of garbage? that would suffer the consequences for publishing the uncorroborated report. ? Mr. Trump said he was untroubled by other intelligence reports that have been made public, which said Russia preferred him over Hillary Clinton and that President Vladimir V. Putin ordered the election meddling to benefit him. ?If Putin likes Donald Trump, guess what, folks: That is called an asset, not a liability,? he said. He added that a strong relationship could allow the two nations to work together on difficult international issues. ? When asked whether he had a message for Mr. Putin, Mr. Trump said: ?He shouldn?t be doing it. He won?t be doing it. Russia will have much greater respect for our country when I am leading it. ? He added: ?There?s no reset button. We?re either going to get along or we?re not. ? But he did not address a question about whether he or anyone on his campaign staff had had contact with Russia during the campaign. ? Mr. Trump swatted away allegations included in the uncorroborated reports. He said that, when traveling, he warns his aides and bodyguards, ?Be very careful, because in your hotel rooms and no matter where you go, you?re gonna probably have cameras. ? He also added, apparently referring to a detail in the report about supposed sex videos with prostitutes, ?I?m also very much of a germaphobe, believe me. ? ? Discussing the topic the news conference was intended to address, Mr. Trump said he would not divest from his vast business holdings as he takes office. Instead, the   will turn over the operations and control of those holdings to a trust controlled by his eldest sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. ? The   said that he had considered letting the Affordable Care Act ?implode? on its own and letting Democrats take the political hit he said would follow. But he said he had decided on a more forthright strategy: repeal and replace ?almost simultaneously. ? Mr. Trump was short on details but clearer in his intention to try to keep Democrats responsible. ?We don?t want to own it politically,? he said. ? Mr. Trump said that he had asked David J. Shulkin, a current under secretary at the Department of Veterans Affairs, to lead that agency after his team had interviewed ?at least 100 people? in the search for a secretary. ? Near the end of the news conference, Mr. Trump got into a shouting match with Jim Acosta of CNN, who tried to press the   into taking a question. ?Since you were attacking our news organization, can you give us a chance?? Mr. Acosta asked. To which Mr. Trump replied: ?Your organization?s terrible,? and ?don?t be rude,? before dismissing the request once and for all: ?You are fake news. ? (CNN was the first to report that Mr. Trump and President Obama had been briefed by intelligence officials on the uncorroborated documents, but the network did not publish them.) ? Sean Spicer, the incoming White House press secretary, spoke first to address the publication of the unverified reports by BuzzFeed on Tuesday. Mr. Spicer called the reports a ?frankly outrageous and highly irresponsible? attack on Mr. Trump and a ?sad, pathetic attempt to get clicks. ? Mr. Spicer said the documents were not an intelligence report and were categorically false. ? Vice   Mike Pence followed Mr. Spicer and amplified his condemnation of news reports by BuzzFeed and other news outlets, which he said were ?irresponsible? and aimed at discrediting Mr. Trump?s legitimate election victory. ? Mr. Trump began by thanking news organizations that did not report what he called ?the nonsense that was released. ? He said he has ?great respect for freedom of the press, and all of that. ? ? Mr. Trump said that the document ?was released by maybe the intelligence agencies, who knows, which would be a tremendous blot on their record. ? ? He went on to cast blame on the Democratic National Committee for the hacking. He praised the Republican National Committee for having better defenses and commended Reince Priebus, his incoming chief of staff, who was the committee chairman. ? Mr. Trump reiterated his description of the report printed by BuzzFeed as ?fake news,? saying he did not think Mr. Putin had compromising information about him or the Republican Party. ?I?ll be honest, if he did have something, he would have released it,? he said. ? He denied that he has any business dealings in Russia: ?I tweeted out that I have no dealings with Russia. I have no deals in Russia. I have no deals that could happen in Russia because we?ve stayed away. And I have no loans with Russia. As a real estate developer, I have very, very little debt. ? ? Mr. Trump said he had requested that the intelligence agencies produce a ?major report? on ?hacking defense? to be delivered 90 days after he takes office, including an examination of ?this situation? with Russia and other incidents of hacking. ? Sheri A. Dillon, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, took the stage to describe how her client would turn over his business assets to a trust. ?  Trump wants there to be no doubt in the minds of the American public that he is completely isolating himself from his business interests,? she said, adding that Mr. Trump?s sons will make all decisions for the company ?without any involvement whatsoever? from Mr. Trump. She said Mr. Trump would resign from all positions he holds with the Trump Organization, as would his daughter Ivanka. ? Ms. Dillon said that the Trump Organization would be allowed to make no new foreign deals during the presidency and that any new domestic deals would be subject to strict restrictions. ?He will only know of a deal if he reads about it in the paper or sees it on TV,? Ms. Dillon said, referring to Mr. Trump. She also said an ethics adviser would be appointed to the management team of the Trump Organization. ? Ms. Dillon argued that selling Mr. Trump?s business would prove more difficult and create more ethical quandaries than the plan that the Trump Organization had chosen. A totally blind trust, she said, would likewise be impossible under the circumstances. And, she added, ?  Trump should not be expected to destroy the company he built. ? ? Ms. Dillon laid out what amounts to the Trump administration?s interpretation of the Constitution?s Emoluments Clause, which prohibits government officials from taking payments or gifts from a foreign government. ?No one would have thought when the Constitution was written, that paying your hotel bill was an emolument,? she said. To avoid any appearances of violations, Ms. Dillon said Mr. Trump had pledged to donate to the United States government all profits made by his hotels from payments by foreign governments. ? Mr. Trump was flanked by a table piled high with manila folders that he said contained paperwork that he had signed turning over control of the Trump Organization to his sons. ? Mr. Trump joked that if his sons failed to do a good job managing the company during his time in office, he would turn to them and say, ?You?re fired. ? ? In other comments about his businesses, Mr. Trump said he had been offered deals worth $2 billion worth in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, ?over the weekend? but had turned them down. ? Asked about his tax returns, Mr. Trump said he was still not releasing them ?because they are under audit. ? He said that the American people did not care about the documents anyway. ?The only one that cares about my tax returns are the reporters,? Mr. Trump said. ? Mr. Trump said he was looking forward to his inauguration. ?It?s going to be a beautiful event,? he said. ?We have great talent, tremendous talent. ? And, he added, ?massive crowds? as well. ? Asked to address criticism that his cabinet choices have presented an abundance of conflicts of interest, Mr. Trump simply praised his appointments. ?I think we have one of the great cabinets ever put together,? he said. ? Mr. Trump said he expected to announce ?big news? in the next few weeks about companies that would build factories in the Midwest. ? Mr. Trump said Carrier?s decision to keep jobs in Indiana sent a clear signal to other companies thinking of moving production overseas. ?The word is now out,? he said, repeating a call for a ?major border tax on these companies that are leaving. ? ? About that wall: ?I don?t feel like waiting a year, a year and a half I want to start building,? he said. He reiterated that Mexico would reimburse the cost, but he added cryptically that it probably wouldn?t be in the form of ?a payment. ? ? Turning to the Supreme Court, Mr. Trump said he expected to announce a nominee to fill the court?s vacant seat two weeks or so after he takes office. ? Mr. Trump was asked how he would reform the news media he criticizes frequently. ?I don?t recommend reforms,? he said. ?I recommend people that have some moral compass. ? He added, ?I will tell you, some of the media outlets that I deal with are fake news, more so than anybody. ?"
17984,Choe Sang-Hun,27/01/2017,2017,1,entertainment,"HAENGCHI VILLAGE, South Korea  ?   Each day hundreds of visitors, many with young children, make a pilgrimage to Haengchi Village, where Ban   was born 72 years ago. They wander through a replica of Mr. Ban?s old   house. They learn about his personal journey to the United Nations, where he was secretary general for 10 years. Despite criticism of his tenure there, Mr. Ban is seen as a role model by vast numbers of South Koreans. School textbooks, for example, celebrate him as a ?man who made South Korea proud. ? And many South Koreans want Mr. Ban to be their next president, succeeding Park   whom the National Assembly voted to impeach last month on corruption charges. When Mr. Ban arrived home on Jan. 12, crowds of   turned out at the airport, waving flags and shouting, ?Ban   please save this country!? Yet there is also deep skepticism about his potential presidential bid, especially among the nation?s progressives. They say he is trying to be part of the establishment yet against it at the same time  ?   a ?Mr. ? in the words of critics. (The word ?ban? in Korean means ?half. ?) Mr. Ban calls himself ?a child of the United Nations,? part of a generation of South Koreans who remembered United Nations handouts in the destitute years after the   Korean War, as well as   United Nations Forces who fought in the war. Many of his contemporaries view the United States as South Korea?s savior and protector. ?I am ready to give my all to uniting the divided country and making South Korea a   nation,? Mr. Ban said. ?As United Nations secretary general, I have seen why some nations prosper and why some fail. ? His advocates say he is a seasoned,   diplomat who can best deal with both North Korea?s advancing nuclear weapons program and President Trump, who has raised questions about Washington?s trade and defense commitments to its allies. One of the first things Mr. Ban did after his homecoming was support the deployment of an American missile defense system that has angered North Korea and China. Critics say his place in the establishment makes him unsuitable as a figure who can restore trust in government. They believe the political class has been disgraced by Ms. Park?s corruption scandal and yet is also desperate for a candidate it can support in an election that could take place as early as this spring. The Constitutional Court is expected to rule in the coming weeks whether Ms. Park should be formally unseated. As Mr. Ban crisscrossed the country after his return, paying homage to the dead at national cemeteries and shaking hands with street vendors, his detractors trailed him, holding signs that called him ?an opportunist,? or worse. ?He has spent his entire life on the sunny side,? said Moon   an opposition leader who comes in ahead of Mr. Ban in surveys on presidential hopefuls. ?He is not the kind who shares the people?s desperate desire for change. ? Lee   who served as South Korea?s prime minister when Mr. Ban was its foreign minister from 2004 to 2006, called Mr. Ban ?a diplomat who looks twice but does not leap. ? Mr. Ban won his United Nations job 10 years ago with the support of Roh   then the president, a progressive who handpicked him as a candidate. Critics called Mr. Ban a turncoat when he later appeared to align himself closely with conservatives, including Ms. Park. His popularity rating as a presidential contender has plummeted in the wake of Ms. Park?s scandal. Since he has returned home, Mr. Ban has defined himself as a ?progressive conservative? who can mend an ideologically fractured country. But some local news media suspect him of   while he tries to find an ally among the existing political parties or to woo enough lawmakers away to form his own. They also call him a ?slippery eel,? accusing him of being notoriously vague on tough questions, a trait that has sometimes served him well as a diplomat but now is under harsher scrutiny as he considers a presidential bid. As United Nations secretary general, he praised the deeply unpopular agreement Ms. Park struck with Japan to end a dispute over ?comfort women,? or Korean sex slaves for Japan?s World War II army. But as a presidential hopeful, he began raising questions about the deal, saying that an agreement that failed to satisfy the surviving victims was not enough. With his popularity ratings stuck behind Mr. Moon?s, the usually   Mr. Ban began bridling at criticism. When journalists recently dogged him with hard questions and then wrote articles that accused him of being   over the comfort women issue, he called them names. (He later apologized.) He has also called himself a Mr. Clean, responding to the outcry over Ms. Park?s scandal. But to people weary of recurring corruption scandals among political leaders and their families, Mr. Ban?s claim has already lost some of its luster this month, the United States indicted his nephew, who is a New York real estate broker, and his younger brother in South Korea on charges of attempting to pay bribes to facilitate a Korean company?s sale of a   commercial building in Vietnam. Mr. Ban denies involvement. Yet here in his home province of Chungcheong, pride in Mr. Ban is compared to a personality cult by his critics. Streets, marathons and   contests are named after him. Songs are written about him, including one that calls him ?Korea?s favorite son who embraced five oceans and six continents. ? In Eumseong, the seat of the county that includes this village, a park displays a circle of bronze busts of Mr. Ban and other former United Nations secretaries general. And this hamlet, which has only a dozen households, is a veritable Ban   theme park. A monument erected by the local Ban clan calls him a ?sacred peak of the world? whose ?warm smile dissipated international conflicts. ? Visitors stroll around the ?Ban   Peace Land,? a small park with a granite monument in the shape of the United Nations headquarters surrounded by flags of member states. In the ?Ban   Memorial Hall,? biographical sketches and video clippings tell how Mr. Ban, with his quiet tenacity and ?warm charisma,? overcame his humble origin and became the ?president of the world. ? ?If I sleep now, I may dream, but if I study now, my dream will come true,? goes one of the 19 Ban   sayings in a museum handout. Older villagers remember the young Mr. Ban walking on a dirt road with his eyes fixated on an English textbook. (His English skills gave him his first big break: As a teenager in 1962, he excelled at an   contest, winning a Red   trip to the White House, where he met President John F. Kennedy and resolved to become a diplomat.) A roadside motel here added more rooms because so many newlyweds believed that if their firstborns were conceived with the blessing of the energy of the mountains surrounding the village, they would grow up to be luminaries like Mr. Ban. ?I brought my children here so they can learn from Secretary General Ban?s life that there is no easy way in life but that if you try hard, your dream comes true,? said Lee   42, who recently visited here with his daughter and son. Kim   65, a   owner who recently visited Mr. Ban?s birthplace, said Mr. Ban?s ?vast experiences and  ? will make him a great president, enabling him to avoid the kind of mistakes that led to Ms. Park?s scandal. ?It?s an honor to have him in our country,? he said. But another visitor, Kim   also a Ban fan, feared that Mr. Ban might not survive the thrust and parry of domestic politics. ?I wonder why he risks ruining his image by entering domestic politics,? he said. ?It?s a mud pit, and he could end up losing all. ?"
18235,Krys Lee,2/02/2017,2017,2,entertainment,"PACHINKOBy Min Jin Lee490 pp. Grand Central Publishing. $27. Min Jin Lee?s stunning novel ?Pachinko?  ?   her second, after ?Free Food for Millionaires? (2007)  ?   announces its ambitions right from the opening sentence: ?History has failed us, but no matter. ? ?Pachinko? chronicles four generations of an ethnic Korean family, first in   Korea in the early 20th century, then in Japan itself from the years before World War II to the late 1980s. The novel opens with an arranged marriage in Yeongdo, a fishing village at the southern tip of Korea. That union produces a daughter, Sunja, who falls in love at 16 with a prominent (and married) mobster. After Sunja becomes pregnant, a local pastor offers her a chance to escape by marrying him and immigrating together to his brother?s house in an ethnic Korean neighborhood in Osaka. Together, they embark into the fraught unknown. Pachinko, the    game ubiquitous throughout Japan, unifies the central concerns of identity, homeland and belonging. For the ethnic Korean population in Japan, discriminated against and shut out of traditional occupations, pachinko parlors are the primary mode of finding work and accumulating wealth. Called Zainichi, or foreign residents, ethnic Koreans are required to reapply for alien registration cards every three years even if they were born in Japan, and are rarely granted passports, making overseas travel nearly impossible. From a young age, Sunja?s oldest son sees being Korean as ?a dark, heavy rock? his greatest, secret desire is to be Japanese. His younger brother, Mozasu, even after he accumulates great wealth through his pachinko parlors, confides to his closest Japanese friend: ?In Seoul, people like me get called Japanese bastards, and in Japan, I?m just another dirty Korean no matter how much money I make or how nice I am. ? Mozasu?s son, Solomon, learns this too quickly after graduating from an American university. He returns to Tokyo on an expat package with the Japanese branch of a British investment bank, then is fired once his ethnic Korean connections are no longer needed for a business deal. Still, Solomon is of a new, less wounded generation. He believes there are still good Japanese people and sees himself as Japanese, too, ?even if the Japanese didn?t think so. ? Like most memorable novels, however, ?Pachinko? resists summary. In this sprawling book, history itself is a character. ?Pachinko? is about outsiders, minorities and the politically disenfranchised. But it is so much more besides. Each time the novel seems to find its locus  ?   Japan?s colonization of Korea, World War II as experienced in East Asia, Christianity, family, love, the changing role of women  ?   it becomes something else. It becomes even more than it was. Despite the compelling sweep of time and history, it is the characters and their tumultuous lives that propel the narrative. Small details subtly reveal the characters? secret selves and build to powerful moments. After Sunja arrives in Osaka, her modest life is underscored when she enters what is only the second restaurant of her life. When her husband, Isak, is finally cleared of   charges and released from jail looking ?both new and ancient,? their oldest son is ?unable to take his eyes off his father for fear he?d disappear. ? Their reunion is moving yet understated: Isak simply holds his son?s hand and says: ?My dear boy. My blessing. ? Dozens more characters amplify the vortex of points of views: a hostess bar girl, a farmer who has ?no wish for the war to end just yet? so that he can benefit from the higher   prices to realize ?his grandfather?s dearest wish? of buying the adjoining land. The numerous shifts are occasionally jolting, but what is gained is a compassionate, clear gaze at the chaotic landscape of life itself. In this haunting epic tale, no one story seems too minor to be briefly illuminated. Lee suggests that behind the facades of wildly different people lie countless private desires, hopes and miseries, if we have the patience and compassion to look and listen."
17767,Justin Gillis,21/03/2017,2017,3,politics,"Marking another milestone for a changing planet, scientists reported on Wednesday that the Earth reached its highest temperature on record in 2016, trouncing a record set only a year earlier, which beat one set in 2014. It is the first time in the modern era of global warming data that temperatures have blown past the previous record three years in a row. The findings come two days before the inauguration of an American president who has called global warming a Chinese plot and vowed to roll back his predecessor?s efforts to cut emissions of   gases. In reality, the Earth is heating up, a point long beyond serious scientific dispute, but one becoming more evident as the records keep falling. Temperatures are heading toward levels that many experts believe will pose a profound threat to both the natural world and to human civilization. In 2015 and 2016, the planetary warming was intensified by the weather pattern known as El Ni?o, in which the Pacific Ocean released a huge burst of energy and water vapor into the atmosphere. But the bigger factor in setting the records was the   trend of rising temperatures, which scientists say is being driven by increasing levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. ?A single warm year is something of a curiosity,? said Deke Arndt, chief of global climate monitoring for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. ?It?s really the trend, and the fact that we?re punching at the ceiling every year now, that is the real indicator that we?re undergoing big changes. ? The heat extremes were especially pervasive in the Arctic, with temperatures in the fall running 20 to 30 degrees Fahrenheit above normal across large stretches of the Arctic Ocean. Sea ice in that region has been in precipitous decline for years, and Arctic communities are already wrestling with enormous problems, such as rapid coastal erosion, caused by the changing climate. ?What?s going on in the Arctic is really very impressive this year was ridiculously off the chart,? said Gavin A. Schmidt, head of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in Manhattan, a unit of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration that tracks global temperatures. But Arctic people were hardly alone in feeling the heat. Drought and starvation afflicted Africa. On May 19, the people in the town of Phalodi lived through the hottest day in the recorded history of India, 123. 8 degrees Fahrenheit. El Ni?o has now ended, and climate scientists almost universally expect 2017 to be cooler than the year before. But the scale of the heat burst has been startling to many of the experts, and some of them fear an accelerated era of global warming could be at hand over the next few years. Even at current temperatures, billions of tons of land ice are melting or sliding into the ocean. The sea is also absorbing most of the heat trapped by human emissions. Those factors are causing the ocean to rise at what appears to be an accelerating pace, and coastal communities in the United States are beginning to spend billions to fight increased tidal flooding. Their pleas for help from Congress have largely been ignored. The finding that a record had been set for the third year in a row was released on Wednesday by three government agencies, two of them American and one British, that track measurements made by ships, buoys and   weather stations. They analyze the figures to correct for known problems, producing an annual average temperature for the surface of the Earth. The national meteorological agency of Japan confirmed the findings in a preliminary analysis. In the British data set, 2016 set a record by only a small amount the margin was larger in the NOAA data set and larger still in NASA?s. NASA does more work than the other groups to take full account of Arctic temperatures, and several scientists said they believed the NASA record to be the most accurate for 2016 for that reason. NASA?s calculations suggested that the planet had warmed by well over a   Fahrenheit from 2013 to 2016. That is a huge change for the surface of an entire planet to undergo in just three years, and it appears to be the largest temperature increase over a   period in the NASA record, which begins in 1880. The findings about a   year were also confirmed by the Berkeley Earth surface temperature project, a nonprofit California group set up to provide a temperature analysis independent of governments. That group, however, did not find that three records had been set in a row in its analysis, 2010 was slightly warmer than 2014. In addition to the surface measurements, satellites are used to measure the temperature of the atmosphere within a few miles of the surface. Two groups that analyze these figures showed a   2016 in data going back to 1978, though in one data set it was a record by only a small margin. Since 1880, NOAA?s records show only one other instance when global temperature records were set three years in a row: in 1939, 1940 and 1941. The Earth has warmed so much in recent decades, however, that 1941 now ranks as only the   year on record. The modern era of global warming began around 1970, after a long stretch of relatively flat temperatures, and the past three years mark the first time in that period that three records were set in a row. Of the 17 hottest years on record, 16 have now occurred since 2000. Two of the agencies that issued Wednesday?s figures, NOAA and NASA, will soon report to cabinet secretaries appointed by   Donald J. Trump, who has expressed doubt about the findings of climate science. In 2012, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, ?The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U. S. manufacturing noncompetitive. ? Fear has erupted within the agencies about whether their data will now be subject to political manipulation. Mr. Trump and his cabinet nominees have given no detailed indication of what their broad climate policies are likely to be, much less how they will manage the scientific enterprise of monitoring the climate. Since he was elected president, Mr. Trump has acknowledged there may be ?some connectivity? between human activity and climate change, and he promised to keep an open mind on the subject. On Wednesday, in questioning before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, Mr. Trump?s nominee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, said, ?I do not believe that climate change is a hoax. ? He did not, however, say whether he believed that Mr. Trump was wrong on climate change. The three   years in a row undercut longstanding claims by a handful of contrarian scientists that global warming stopped after 1998. That argument was never backed by good statistical evidence, but it was highlighted repeatedly in Congress and on the presidential campaign trail in 2016. When the heat buildup in the ocean is taken into account, global temperatures are rising relentlessly. Scientists have calculated that the heat accumulating throughout the Earth because of human emissions is roughly equal to the energy that would be released by 400, 000 Hiroshima atomic bombs exploding across the planet every day. It is true that at the Earth?s surface, the warming seems to be proceeding in fits and starts. ?The arc of global warming will be variously steep and less steep,? said Richard Seager, a climate scientist at the   Earth Observatory of Columbia University. ?It never stopped. ? In fact, the rate over time has been reasonably close to predictions that scientists first offered decades ago. Those same scientists have long warned that humanity is courting disaster by failing to bring   emissions under control. For example, many experts on sea level believe that a rise of 15 or 20 feet has already become inevitable, though they cannot say how fast it will happen. A rise that large would drown most of the world?s coastal cities without heroic efforts to fortify them."
17757,Katie Rogers and Gia Kourlas,10/02/2017,2017,2,politics,"Like hundreds of young dancers before her, Phoebe Pearl dropped everything to become a Rockette. Ms. Pearl was 19 when she quit the Boston Conservatory in 2009 to join the elite group of dancers  ?   strong, athletic and poised  ?   who are as emblematic of New York City as the Empire State Building and the yellow taxi cab. For eight years, she was proud to be a Rockette, and the company treated her well, with generous pay and health insurance. But in   when management announced that the dancers would perform at the inauguration of Donald J. Trump, Ms. Pearl did something that a Rockette is never supposed to do. She stepped out of line, breaking with the silent, smiling solidarity that defines the    institution, to denounce the idea of celebrating a man with a   history of objectifying women. In a rare collision of presidential politics and a venerable arts organization, current and former Rockettes find themselves in a new kind of spotlight  ?   a position both painful and empowering  ?   as they take sides over the inauguration, a split illustrating the cultural divide that   Trump has cleaved through the country. ?We are a group of women that is encouraging young girls to be strong, independent women, to fulfill their dreams, to go for it,? Ms. Pearl, 27, said in her first interview since the inaugural uproar began. ?It?s about women?s rights. ? But Patty DeCarlo Grantham, the president of the Rockette Alumnae Association, which has about 550 members, said that many of them are upset about the furor and support the Rockettes performing at the inauguration, as they did in 2001 and 2005. ?So many people wrote to me and said, ?I feel so ashamed about what?s going on,?? said Ms. Grantham, 76. ?We feel like it?s a great honor to be asked to dance. ? Best known as a Christmastime tourist attraction at Radio City Music Hall, the Rockettes are also regarded in artistic circles as some of the finest dancers in New York City. But the controversy has reignited sensitivities within the corps that they are seen as beauty pageant contestants more than skilled performers and that they are easy to lampoon. On last weekend?s episode of ?Saturday Night Live,? Alec Baldwin, portraying Mr. Trump, said of the inauguration lineup, ?Best of all, we?ve got the one Rockette with the least money in her savings. ? Dottie   a    former Rockette, said, ?Here you have the most sophisticated women that are so well respected in this country. ? She added, ?To put them on the same stage as this man, to me, is reprehensible. ? The individual Rockettes had no say in the inauguration booking: It was ultimately the decision of James L. Dolan, the executive chairman of the Madison Square Garden Company, which manages the Rockettes. Mr. Dolan is a longtime friend of Mr. Trump and donated to his campaign he has supported both Democrats and Republicans in the past. A company spokesman, Barry Watkins, declined requests for interviews with Mr. Dolan and current leaders and members of the Rockettes. Mr. Watkins, in response to written questions about the Rockettes as well as the inauguration performance, wrote by email, ?The New York Times has had an   Trump agenda for quite some time and now the Rockettes are on the receiving end of their bias. ? This article is based on interviews over the last three weeks with Ms. Pearl, who was a Rockette until this month, and nine former Rockettes, as well as others in the extended Rockette organization. Several people spoke anonymously for fear that if they were to speak publicly, the Madison Square Garden Company would take legal action against them. The backlash over the inauguration performance began on Twitter and Facebook after Ms. Pearl wrote a private Instagram post. ?I am speaking for just myself, but please know that after we found out this news, we have been performing with tears in our eyes and heavy hearts,? Ms. Pearl wrote. She believes a friend of hers shared her photo with the celebrity gossip blog Perez Hilton. She and her fellow performers would later learn that their performance at the inauguration would not be mandatory, as some feared, but it was too late to stop criticism from strangers who took to social media to tell her to shut up and dance. Supporters wondered whether she and her fellow dancers were under a gag order. A news crew, Ms. Pearl said, showed up at her Harlem apartment. That sort of attention came as a shock within the world of the Rockettes, which is devoted to a particular kind of   synchronicity, where no one person dominates the stage. A Radio City Rockette is a specialist in precision dance technique, a rare, regimented and intricate style that requires both athleticism and artistry. Rockettes must stand between    and       and uphold a standard of elegance, along with an expertise in tap, modern dance, jazz and ballet. They must hit positions with military exactitude. It?s a style that requires a dancer to step into a line  ?   not to take over and not to be left behind. It takes fortitude and humility. ?You don?t realize how much individuality you have as a dancer until you?re asked to dance like 35 other women,? said Jessica McRoberts, 39, a former Rockette. ?Things down to your pinkie finger. ? Under the leadership of Linda Haberman, who began directing and choreographing touring productions of the ?Christmas Spectacular? in 1993, the Rockettes gained artistic respect and became modernized with more challenging choreography. Ms. Haberman left the organization in 2014 and declined a request for comment. Despite requests, the Madison Square Garden Company did not make the troupe?s current director, Karen Keeler, available for interviews. The rigors of performing and traveling as a company often allow dancers to form close and lasting bonds, according to Ms. Grantham, the alumnae president, who was a Rockette from 1959 until 1970. Ms. Grantham said that the Rockettes have a long history of performing for presidents and at events in New York City hosted by both Republicans and Democrats. ?One time we did benefits for both parties in one night,? she said. ?One was at the Sheraton, and the other was at the Hilton. ? This wouldn?t be the first time the Rockettes performed for a controversial president, but the volatile media climate surrounding Mr. Trump?s inauguration is unusual. Rhonda Malkin, a former Rockette who worked as a personal trainer to Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner for two years, said that the Trump and Kushner families were supportive of her career as a Rockette. Once, they attended a performance to see her dance. ?I think they would like to see the Rockettes perform at the inauguration,? she said of the Trump family. ?Whether or not that causes a rift throughout the brand is yet to be seen. ? Ms. Malkin, 38, said that several of the current Rockettes she knows are upset that a crew of 13   Rockettes were initially told by their union, the American Guild of Variety Artists, that they would be forced to perform. ?There are some career Rockettes who are very upset about this,? Ms. Malkin said of the inauguration plans. ?I?ve also heard the women of color are very upset. From what I have heard, it has just caused a real rift in the company. ? Ms. Malkin, who was a Rockette for 12 years, said Ms. Pearl ?took a real risk? for speaking out, but she doubts that the controversy surrounding the inauguration has caused any lasting damage to the brand. ?I would honestly say that the majority of our audience members are white Christian conservative people,? Ms. Malkin said. ?And those folks probably supported Trump. ? Of Mr. Dolan, the Madison Square Garden chairman, she added, ?He knows those are the people who buy tickets to those shows. ? While the Rockettes are an American symbol  ?   as much as Radio City Music Hall or Mr. Trump and his branded buildings  ?   the group?s individual dancers remain fairly anonymous. They don?t speak unless deemed   by the Madison Square Garden Company, which has fiercely protected them against criticism surrounding the inauguration. ?For a while we weren?t allowed to say, ?I?m going to be on the ?Today? show with the Rockettes tomorrow morning,?? said Naomi Kakuk, 40, a former Rockette. ?You?d say: ?Watch the ?Today? show tomorrow  ?   you might see a familiar face.? We couldn?t even say we were on a show that was promoting the show. ? Mr. Dolan has been criticized for making the inauguration deal and guarding the Rockettes from media requests, but several former dancers praised his management style, which include generous benefits. Being a Rockette is among the most lucrative jobs a dancer can get in New York, complete with   health insurance even though the company performs on a seasonal basis. Ms. Kakuk, who loved her time as a Rockette, said, ?You get six months of pay for three months of work, and it is six months? worth of work in three months because it?s so incredibly intense. ? She added that some of the dancers live in New York during the Christmas show and then go home to Wisconsin or Florida to teach. ?You have insurance for the year, you have a great paycheck, you do all these fun gigs and side things, and you?re doing the show and dancing on the great stage,? Ms. Kakuk said. ?You?re skinny as hell when you get out. You?re bikini ready in January. It?s amazing. ? Cheryl Cutlip, who danced as a Rockette for 15 years and left the company in 2008, said that benefits were ushered in quickly after the TV company Cablevision bought Radio City Music Hall in 1997. Ms. Cutlip, 45, remembered Mr. Dolan meeting with the Rockettes to go over their basic needs. She said he gave them his personal email address. Soon, Rockettes no longer had to rush out of the door to find coffee and a bagel in the   space between performance preparations. ?He started bringing food in,? Ms. Cutlip said of Mr. Dolan. ?Once he saw the practical needs of the Rockettes, he started meeting them. ? For other former Rockettes, the current controversy reminded them of clashes between the dancers, their union and their corporate employer. Lora Pavilack, a former Rockette, said she had been locked out of the building twice, once for talking to the news media and, another time, during contentious negotiations over a union contract. ?That?s the culture,? she said, ?and that?s why they?ve lined up with the  . ? Ms. Malkin said that she was also locked out with Ms. Pavilack during contract negotiations in 2005. Madison Square Garden officials declined to comment for this article, but they have said in the past that no one had been locked out during contract negotiations. More than enough Rockettes wanted to perform at the inaugural, but Ms. Kakuk also knows some who are not participating. ?I think some of them are done anyway,? she said, ?and they were like, ?This is the last straw, I?m out. ?? Ms. Pearl is one of them. On a recent evening, she ended weeks of silence by taking part in a toast to the First Amendment presented by the Bessies, or the New York Dance and Performance Awards. ?People have been calling me courageous,? Ms. Pearl said at the toast, her voice cracking. ?But I don?t see it that way. I?m just standing up for human rights. ? Many in the dance world, including Yvonne Rainer, the postmodern giant who was part of the toast, and several former Rockettes, including Ms. Kakuk, have voiced enthusiasm for Ms. Pearl?s action and her talent as a dancer. ?When you see her onstage as a Rockette, you watch her,? Ms. Kakuk said. ?She?s outspoken but less so than others. It was a bit of a surprise. ? With the latest holiday season behind her, Ms. Pearl has decided to leave the organization and forge a path in film and television. She found inspiration in the actress Meryl Streep, who spoke out against Mr. Trump at the Golden Globes. ?She can speak freely,? Ms. Pearl said. ?I wish to have the opportunity to speak as freely as I can, without any repercussion. ? But stepping out of the line is just not the Rockettes? way. ?Usually artists are more outspoken,? Ms. Kakuk said, ?but Rockettes as a brand is not very outspoken. You work for a giant corporation, and a lot of girls don?t realize that. They just think they?re dancing. ?"
17795,"Sheri Fink, James Risen and Charlie Savage",20/01/2017,2017,1,crime,"When C. I. A. interrogators in a Thailand prison sent a cable to agency headquarters recounting that they had been slamming Abu Zubaydah, a captured terrorism suspect, against a wall, they emphasized that they were obeying instructions to take steps to prevent his injury, like putting a   towel behind his neck, and described the practice in detached terms. ?Subject was walled with the question, ?What is it that you do not want us to know? ?? reported a cable from Aug. 5, 2002, part of a trove of newly disclosed documents about the agency?s   ?enhanced interrogation? program. ?Subject continued to deny that he had any information. ? From the perspective of Mr. Zubaydah  ?   whom interrogators eventually conceded had no additional information, contrary to their suspicions at the time  ?   the experience felt far different. ?He kept banging me against the wall,? Mr. Zubaydah told his lawyer in 2008, in a narrative that has now been declassified. ?Given the intensity of the banging that was strongly hitting my head I fell down on the floor with each banging. I felt for few instants that I was unable to see anything, let alone the short chains that prevented me from standing tall. And every time I fell he would drag me with the towel which caused bleeding in my neck. ? Batches of newly disclosed documents about the Central Intelligence Agency?s defunct torture program are providing new details about its practices of slamming terrorism suspects into walls, confining them in coffinlike boxes and subjecting them to waterboarding  ?   as well as internal disputes over whether two psychologists who designed the program were competent. The release of the newly available primary documents, which include information not discussed in a   executive summary of the Senate Intelligence Committee?s investigation into the C. I. A. torture program that was released in 2014, comes at the same time as an urgent legal battle is unfolding over the potential fate of the     full version of that report. Lawyers for two detainees who were subjected to the C. I. A. ?s most extreme ?enhanced? interrogation techniques, Mr. Zubaydah and Abd     the suspected mastermind of the deadly October 2000 attack on the American destroyer Cole, are asking federal judges to order the executive branch to deposit a copy of the full report with the judiciary to ensure that the Trump administration and congressional Republicans do not destroy it. But the Obama administration, in its waning hours, is fighting that idea. On Thursday, the judge overseeing Mr. Zubaydah?s habeas corpus case, Emmet G. Sullivan, ordered the United States government to ?immediately? preserve a complete, unredacted copy of the Senate report and deposit it with the court for secure storage by Feb. 10. Against that backdrop, the two sets of newly available documents present a vivid contrast in perspectives, as the C. I. A. cables recount in bloodless bureaucratese the infliction of techniques that Mr. Zubaydah recalled experiencing in harrowing terms. For example, when interrogators at a C. I. A. black site prison in Thailand confined Mr. Zubaydah in a cramped box on Aug. 5, 2002, they observed to headquarters that he showed ?signs of distress,? according to one of the cables from a group the government declassified as part of a lawsuit against the psychologists who designed the program. The lawsuit is being brought by detainees represented by lawyers including from the American Civil Liberties Union. The A. C. L. U. provided the documents to The New York Times. Mr. Zubaydah remembered the box experience in more vivid terms. ?I felt I was going to explode from bending my legs and my back and from being unable to spread them not even for short instants,? he wrote to his lawyers in 2008, noting that the box was so short and tight he could not sit up or change positions. ?The very strong pain made me scream unconsciously. ? Other C. I. A. cables also clinically recount applying torture methods like the suffocation technique known as waterboarding. (Previously disclosed documents and the Senate report executive summary had already discussed Mr. Zubaydah?s waterboarding in extensive detail, including that he was subjected to the treatment 83 times in one month.) The contemporaneous cables describe him crying, but generally use bland descriptions, like: ?Water treatment was applied. ? For Mr. Zubaydah, it felt as if he was ?dying. ? ?They kept pouring water and concentrating on my nose and my mouth until I really felt I was drowning and my chest was just about to explode from the lack of oxygen. ? Mr. Zubaydah also described experiencing what he thought were persistent health consequences of his torture, including severe headaches and seizures. Many other detainees experienced lasting harm after harsh treatment in American custody, including   stress disorder, a recent New York Times investigation found. Another group of documents produced in discovery from that lawsuit, first provided by the A. C. L. U. to The Washington Post, showed that in   about a year after the agency hired the two contract psychologists, James Mitchell and J. Bruce Jessen, to design a torture regimen for Mr. Zubaydah, unidentified C. I. A. employees raised sharp questions about their ethics and competence to judge whether the techniques they had orchestrated were harmful or effective. While other documents, including the Senate report summary, have shown that there were internal concerns about relying so heavily on the two psychologists, the newly available documents add texture to that history. For example, a June 2003 message that appears to have been sent by an official representing a ?Renditions and Detainees Group? at the C. I. A. which had assumed control of Mr. Mitchell?s and Mr. Jessen?s activities, criticized the psychologists? ?arrogance and narcissism? and ?blatant disregard for the ethics shared by almost all of their colleagues. ? But the same message also recommended that the two psychologists be assigned to develop a code of ethics and standards for interrogators. ?We have identified this as a major gap in our program,? the official wrote. A lawyer for the psychologists, Henry F. Schuelke III, declined to comment. The newly available files supplement the publicly available historical record about the torture program, intensifying questions about whether the public will ever see the full fruits of the Senate Intelligence Committee?s investigation  ?   the result of years of combing and contextualizing millions of pages of government documents by committee staff members. Democrats raised fears last month that the incoming administration of   Donald J. Trump, who has voiced support for the outlawed interrogation methods detailed in the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report, could cause all copies of the document to be ?hidden indefinitely, or destroyed. ? In 2015, after Republicans took control of the Senate and the Intelligence Committee, they asked President Obama to return all copies of the full report, which former Democratic senators have said contains ?volumes of new information? that were not made public when a   executive summary was disclosed in 2014. Mr. Obama did not comply with that request, and in December of last year, he notified the Senate that he was including a copy of the full,   report in his presidential records that would be deposited at the National Archives. But Michel Paradis, a lawyer for Mr. Nashiri, argued that Mr. Obama?s decision about his presidential records was insufficient, because Mr. Trump might seek to withdraw the report from the archives and destroy it. Last week, in response to a request by Mr. Nashiri?s lawyers to secure a copy of the full report in the hands of the judiciary, Judge Royce C. Lamberth of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia ordered the Obama administration to provide a copy to the court?s security officer. (Lawyers for Mr. Zubaydah are separately making the same request.) But in court filings, the Obama administration asked Judge Lamberth to reconsider, making two arguments: Preserving it would interfere with   branch relations, and giving a copy to the court was unnecessary in part because of Mr. Obama?s archived copy. It also suggested that the executive branch would appeal if the judge did not change his mind. On Thursday afternoon, Judge Lamberth refused, saying in a terse,   order that the court was ?obliged? to protect Mr. Nashiri?s possible right to access the report and saying that nothing had changed since he issued the original, ?crystal clear? order. He threatened to hold the executive branch in contempt if it did not comply, although he did not set a specific deadline. The C. I. A. cables revealed other potentially important new details. For example, detainees at C. I. A. prisons have long claimed that they were injected with unknown drugs against their consent, which had powerful effects on them  ?   something that medical experts have denounced as unethical. While previously released documents from 2004 said that C. I. A. prisoners could be sedated as a last resort, a newly released cable describes a different practice. In April 2002, C. I. A. personnel at an interrogation site wrote that they planned to transport a detainee  ?   apparently Mr. Zubaydah  ?   ?in a state of pharmaceutical unconsciousness to decrease potential security concerns as well as to maximize the intended effect of disorienting? him. It is unclear from the documents whether the C. I. A. followed through. The new information is consistent with the conclusion of the Senate committee?s torture report that the C. I. A. ?s use of enhanced interrogation techniques was not effective in acquiring intelligence or gaining cooperation from detainees. On Aug. 18, 2002, after 15 days during which Mr. Zubaydah was repeatedly waterboarded, kept for hours in small boxes, pushed into walls and threatened, the interrogators sent a cable to headquarters stating their conclusions. The prisoner ?has not provided significant actionable info beyond previously provided details,? they wrote."
18195,James Poniewozik,2/02/2017,2017,2,crime,"?Cops don?t even want to make a damn traffic stop. Afraid they?ll wind up on Anderson Cooper. ? ?Maybe [the police] are not going to have to be so politically correct. Maybe they?re being overly politically correct. ? The first quotation is from Frank Rourke (Bill Paxton) the morally suspect but brutally effective Los Angeles police detective at the center of CBS?s ?Training Day. ? The second is from the new president of the United States. If you have a hard time telling them apart, who can blame you? The candidate Donald J. Trump, running on ?law and order? rhetoric borrowed from Richard M. Nixon, talked crime as if he were recapping a ?70s cop drama. He repeatedly  ?   and falsely  ?   claimed that United States murder rates were the highest in 45 years. Cities, to him, were lawless hellscapes: ?You walk down the street, you get shot. ? That?s essentially the outlook of two new police shows  ?   ?Training Day? and Fox?s ?A. P. B. ?  ?   each of which depicts American cities as   zones that need a tough,   boor to break rules, crack skulls and restore order. In the 2001 film ?Training Day,? Denzel Washington played a corrupt narcotics detective with a knack for busting drug gangs and a weakness for skimming the take. CBS?s ?Training Day,? beginning on Thursday and set in the present, has a tenuous connection to the original. Antoine Fuqua, the film?s director, is among the producers (who also include Jerry Bruckheimer, of ?C. S. I. ?). But it perverts the dynamic of the film by making its central cop into a charming, roguish maverick. Here, Frank is partnered with Kyle Craig (Justin Cornwell) an idealistic ?trainee? who is actually working undercover to investigate whether Frank has been crossing ethical lines. He has, and he?s damn proud of it. On their first outing, Frank lays out his philosophy: ?Police work?s like sex, Kyle. It?s a lot more effective if it isn?t pretty. ? (I would not recommend this as a pickup line.) They cruise the squalid streets as Frank cites some statistics of Trumpian dubiousness: Crime is ?up 300 percent,? which does not seem to square with recent Los Angeles police data. ?It?s like ?The Purge? every night,? he says. Ugly times call for ugly tactics, he feels. If a few lies get told, a few suspects get tortured, a few confiscated dollars go missing  ?   hey, freedom ain?t free. ?Training Day? starts off building tension between idealism and security, but it ends up in the tank for Frank. Mr. Cornwell plays Kyle as an upstanding stiff, and the authorities investigating Frank are vindictive bureaucrats. Mr. Paxton gets to deliver the best lines and blow the most stuff up. Wry and swaggering, he?s the only one having any fun here, which pushes the audience to Frank?s side. In this formulaic ?cop who won?t play by the book? setup, the book doesn?t stand a chance. Kyle decides to work with Frank rather than turn him in, and ?Training Day? loses its nerve in the process, turning Frank into a raffish renegade who just says what everybody?s thinking. (His name is ?Frank,? after all.) This ?Training Day? is a   version of the movie, which paired Mr. Washington with Ethan Hawke as the   rookie. The racial dynamic is glaring as nostalgic white guy Frank fights to Make L. A. Great Again against largely minority criminals. An episode that pits him against Japanese mobsters is almost parodic. ?How is a yakuza like a cue ball?? he says, while beating information out of one. ?The harder you hit ?em, the better their English gets!? He ends up using an aluminum baseball bat to duel with a    mob boss, a Yankee Doodle metaphor that?s as subtle as an aluminum baseball bat. If ?Training Day? comes from the ?Dirty Harry? school of pop authoritarianism, Fox?s ?A. P. B. ,? beginning on Monday, is a Silicon Valley ?Batman. ? Its origin story: on a business trip to Chicago, the billionaire engineer Gideon Reeves (Justin Kirk) watches his best friend die in an armed robbery. Outraged by the sluggish 911 response, he bullies the city government into giving him control of an overwhelmed police precinct. He promptly equips officers with drones,   tasers and a smartphone app for instantaneous police response. RoboCop, meet UberCop. Chicago has become a flash point, to the right for its murder rate (Mr. Trump recently threatened to ?send in the Feds! ?) and to the left for police brutality. But in ?A. P. B. ,? all the city needs is  ?   sound familiar?  ?   a cocky, rude,    billionaire to disrupt the establishment. ?A. P. B. ,? inspired by a New York Times Magazine article about a   police force in New Orleans, stumbled into its relevance. At heart, it doesn?t aim to be more than a disposable,    action show. Mr. Kirk is disarmingly snide as the arrogant Gideon. There?s a little melodrama and a lot of   and the crime stories are as mechanical as Gideon?s gadgets. The closest the show gets to big ideas about policing come when the     detective Theresa Murphy (Natalie Martinez) reminds her new boss that computers can?t replace the human element. Like ?Training Day,? ?A. P. B. ? was in the works well before Election Day (though not before Black Lives Matter and the reaction to it). The shows? content is mainly driven by the eternal needs of broadcast drama: heroes (or, increasingly, antiheroes) villains and   stakes. You can?t make much of a crime procedural out of people not committing crimes. Occasionally, a serial like HBO?s ?The Wire? or FX?s ?The Shield? will question the tactics and premises of an objective like the war on drugs. In March, Fox will air ?Shots Fired,? a provocative series about the complicated aftermath of a racially charged shooting in North Carolina. Most network police series don?t have that kind of ambition. But intentionally or not, ?Training Day? and ?A. P. B. ? have a message, anyway: that it?s a sick, sad world, and if you want to live, you?d best give a free hand to the kind of abrasive jerks you see on TV. They alone can fix it."
17635,Jennifer Schuessler,13/01/2017,2017,1,entertainment,"The Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in New York City, Chicano Park in San Diego, a Native American burial ground in Kansas and the site of the 1970 shootings at Kent State University are among 24 newly designated National Historic Landmarks. The list of new landmarks, announced on Wednesday, comes as the National Park Service, the division of the Department of the Interior that administers the landmarks program, has finished celebrating its 100th anniversary. It reflects an effort to tell what a news release called ?a more inclusive and diverse story of America?s history. ? ?These 24 new designations depict different threads of the American story that have been told through activism, architecture, music and religious observance,? Sally Jewell, the secretary of the Interior, said in a statement. ?Their designation ensures that future generations have the ability to learn from the past. ? The sites, which join a list of more than 2, 500 existing national historic landmarks, may reflect America?s past, but they also might be read as carrying some pointed political lessons for the future. They include the homes of the slain civil rights leader Medgar Evers the   lawyer and women?s rights activist Pauli Murray and the   Tejano statesman Jos? Antonio Navarro, who is cited for ?his commitments to both American ideals and to the rights of Texan  ? in the period before and after Texas became part of the United States. The Navarro home is just one of several new landmarks relating to the history of   activism, including Chicano Park in San Diego, site of some ultimately successful 1970 community protests. Other citations speak to the sometimes deadly legacies of government action. The citation for Wyandotte National Burying Ground in Kansas City, Kan. describes it as ?tangible evidence of the consequences of federal American Indian removal policy to a tribal population and its identity. ? The citation for the Kent State site, where the Ohio National Guard shot and killed four students and wounded nine other people during a protest against the Vietnam War, refers to subsequent rulings by the Supreme Court that ?the executive branch of government does not enjoy absolute immunity for its actions. ? A number of the sites are recognized for what may seem to be more straightforward significance as architecture or engineering, like the Neutra Studio and Residences in Los Angeles (associated with the modernist Richard Neutra) and the   Organ, at a Methodist camp in Round Lake, N. Y. The instrument is cited as ?an example of the technical and mechanical achievements in the   War American   industry. ? But even the designations for some seemingly straightforward sites might be seen as resonant with contemporary politics. The New York State Barge Canal, begun in 1905, is called ?an embodiment of a Progressive Era emphasis on public works,? which was ?built explicitly to counter the growing monopoly of railroad corporations. ? Kevin Young, the director of the Schomburg Center, a division of the New York Public Library in Harlem, said in an email that he was ?especially pleased? that the announcement had noted the center?s social mission of promoting ?intellectual freedom and social equality. ? He also noted the reference to the   roots of its namesake, the   immigrant bibliophile Arturo Schomburg. ?Our focus on the entire African Diaspora has been important ever since our start 92 years ago,? said Mr. Young, who took over leadership at the center in December. ?I am looking forward personally to exploring the   connection, both in our collections and lively programming. ?"
18310,Tamar Adler,14/02/2017,2017,2,business,"Editor?s note: We?re resurfacing this Eat column from last year for Smarter Living to give you some ideas for using up any leftover holiday wine. It is a new year. We have resolved, and a popular fixture in our resolutions is booze. We used it well: It went into punch. It went into grog. It went into mulled wine, cocktails and eggnog. It went straight in. It began in a trickle that became a geyser. Now we are pickled. Which is why January, though a poor time for drinking alcohol, is a good time for cooking with it. In particular, with wine  ?   which is, in the elegant and spiritually stirring formulation of Robert Farrar Capon, the late Episcopal priest and cookbook author, ??water that has matured according to nature?s will. ?? Recipes using wine are notably less common today than they were half a century ago, when every fondue pot and chafing dish released rich gusts of boozy vapor. But there is little better use for the thousands of   bottles that litter refrigerators and counters than to help them effect a secular transubstantiation in our dinners. The alcohol in wine evaporates more quickly than water and is mostly gone after 30 minutes? cooking. What is left is the taste of the grape that made it, among dozens of ghost flavors: cherry, violet, ash, pineapple, fresh leather, apple, black pepper, wet soil, mandarin, lilac or rose. Plus, a light acidity that keeps the palate alive and alert, and an unmistakable elegance that can be neither explained nor ignored. I have always found most enticing those recipes that truly rely on wine and demand it in quantity, raw and crude and as it is. The food writer Richard Olney recommends Soupe ? la Bourguignonne, ??Red Wine Soup??: pork fat, butter, onions, flour, water, stale bread, herbs and almost an entire bottle of red wine. There is ??Bavarian Wine Soup,?? from ??The Wine Cook Book?? (1934): three parts wine to one part water, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and a beaten egg yolk, served with water crackers. Olney also describes a ??typical Bordelais tourain,?? which is usually eaten during the   harvest but could stand a winter reprise. Its ingredients are onions cooked in fat, salt, tomatoes, sugar, boiling water, stale bread and dry white wine. ??A native,?? Olney writes, ??may first eat his sopped bread crust, empty out his (red) wine glass into the soup, and drink the rest from the soup plate, a performance known as faire chabrol??  ?   that is, ??to act like a little goat. ?? The simplest way to cook with wine is just to cook in it. A combination of half wine, half water or broth will cook any tough cut of meat flavorfully and subtly. But an even simpler and deeper pleasure can be found in cooking entirely in wine, with occasional pours of broth to keep things balanced, but the responsibility squarely on the shoulders of the juice of the grape. Coq au vin is of this lineage. So is a variation I prefer: coq au vin blanc, or coq au vin jaune, which leaves the old rooster or capon tasting as if it got taken to a party it wasn?t expecting, thoroughly saturated in the complexities of deep dark yellow wine and a long night on the town. There are a few questions that bedevil those who decide to try their hands at cooking with booze. What kind of wine? Father Capon wrote the most useful rule: ??White for lighter meats, red for heavier, but don?t make a fetish of it. ?? I lean toward the dry and the     but nothing too delicate, because the delicacy will be lost in cooking, and nothing too tannic or inky, which will turn to acidic mud. Can a wine be too good for cooking? Olney writes: ??One may respectfully find a place in the kitchen for a great wine only if heat never comes into contact with it. ?? That makes sense. If a fine wine is going to be put anywhere but a glass, it must stay unchanged until it reaches its final destination. Can it be too bad? Olney says if you would not drink it, do not cook with it. The former chef Daniel Gritzer recently conducted experiments and found that a wine that started overly fruity and   ended that way, but that a wine that was once good, then oxidized, resulted in a very good dish. This is my theory too  ?   it is mostly the alcohol in the wine that oxidizes when a bottle is open and old. It is also the alcohol that disappears in cooking. Don?t worry if uncooked wine tastes oxidized before it is added to a braise or stew  ?   as long as it tasted good in its past, however distant. Are there spirits that shouldn?t be cooked in? Scotch, vodka, gin, tequila and moonshine do not make good stew. All of them are, however, capable of sousing and pickling a fish as they are of sousing and pickling a human. And to more attractive ends. Recipe: Boeuf ? la Mode"
17871,Tyler Kepner,23/01/2017,2017,1,sports,"When Yordano Ventura won Game 6 of the 2014 World Series for the Kansas City Royals, he wore the initials of Oscar Taveras on his cap. Taveras, an outfielder for the St. Louis Cardinals, had just been killed in a car accident in the Dominican Republic, the homeland they shared. Early Sunday morning, Ventura was killed in a car accident there at 25. Andy Marte, 33, a former infielder who spent parts of seven seasons with Atlanta, Cleveland and Arizona, was killed in another car crash Sunday in the Dominican Republic. Major League Baseball announced the deaths on its social media accounts. The traffic authorities in the Dominican Republic said that it was not clear whether Ventura had been driving when he died on a highway about 40 miles northwest of the capital, Santo Domingo. Marte died when the   he was driving hit a house about 95 miles north of Santo Domingo, the authorities said. Ventura was a     who reached the majors in September 2013 and seemed destined to stay for many years. He had a record of   with a 3. 89 earned run average, and he was part of the team?s core, with a $23 million contract that could have bound him to Kansas City through 2021. ?I love you my brother,? Royals first baseman Eric Hosmer wrote on Instagram, sharing a photograph of himself with Ventura. ?I?m in disbelief and don?t know what to say. I love you ACE. ? Only one qualified starting pitcher, the Mets? Noah Syndergaard, had a harder average fastball last season than Ventura?s Syndergaard?s averaged 97. 9 miles per hour, Ventura?s 96. 1 m. p. h. Ventura made three World Series starts, two in 2014 against the San Francisco Giants, and then a loss to the Mets at Citi Field in 2015. He gained a measure of notoriety last season when he was suspended for eight games for hitting Baltimore?s Manny Machado in the back with a fastball, inciting a brawl. Ventura was   with a 4. 45 E. R. A. in his final season. Marte spent the past two seasons playing professionally in South Korea. Once a promising prospect for the Braves, he was traded to Boston for Edgar Renteria in 2005, and he was then quickly sent to Cleveland in a multiplayer deal that brought Coco Crisp to the Red Sox. Marte played 278 of his 308 career games with the Indians, and batted . 218, with 21 homers and 99 runs batted in, over all. ?He was a genuine person who always greeted you with a warm smile,? the Indians wrote on Twitter. Tony Clark, the executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association, said in a statement: ?It?s never easy to lose a member of our fraternity, and there are no words to describe the feeling of losing two young men in the prime of their lives. Our thoughts and prayers go out to their families, friends, teammates and fans throughout the United States and Latin America. ? The Dominican Republic?s president, Danilo Medina, posted on Twitter that the nation ?is dressed in mourning with the deaths of Andy Marte and Yordano Ventura, great sportsmen who raised high our national banner. ? Fans began arriving at Kansas City?s Kauffman Stadium shortly after Ventura?s death was announced, leaving flowers, hats and other mementos outside. Flags at the ballpark were lowered to  . A 2015 study by the World Health Organization found that the Dominican Republic had the highest traffic accident death rate in the Americas, 29. 3 per 100, 000 inhabitants. The deaths of Ventura and Marte follow the death of another major leaguer, the Miami Marlins?   pitcher Jose Fernandez, in a boating accident in September."
18026,Jaime Yaya Barry and Dionne Searcey,27/01/2017,2017,1,sports,"BANJUL, Gambia  ?   A week after he was inaugurated in another country, Adama Barrow landed in Gambia on Thursday afternoon, setting foot inside his own national borders for the first time as the new president. Throngs of supporters, some holding Gambian flags, lined the roads to greet Mr. Barrow, who had flown in from Dakar, Senegal, where he had fled more than a week earlier out of security concerns after his predecessor, Yahya Jammeh, refused to step down. As he entered Banjul, the capital, Mr. Barrow, dressed in all white, poked out of a white Land Cruiser surrounded by military vehicles and waved to onlookers. ?Today is freedom day,? said Mariama Bah, a nurse from Serekunda, a town nearby, who came to the airport to welcome President Barrow. ?We now have a president that we can be proud of. ? Mr. Barrow defeated the longtime president, Mr. Jammeh, in a surprising outcome to an election in December. Mr. Jammeh, who had been in power since 1994, when he led a successful coup, initially accepted defeat. A few days after the vote, he changed his mind, declared the election results invalid and vowed to use the power of his military to stay in charge. It took repeated personal overtures from West African presidents and finally a regional coalition of troops that crossed into Gambia to persuade Mr. Jammeh, known for human rights abuses, to step down. He flew out of the country on Saturday, accompanied by a cargo plane containing his   and other luxury automobiles, and has settled in Equatorial Guinea, which has its own record of human rights violations. Mr. Barrow?s arrival capped a tense period for many Gambians who had feared a bloody end to the presidential standoff. Tens of thousands of residents had been so worried that they fled the country, though many have already returned. But Mr. Jammeh still has supporters left in Gambia, and some residents worry that divisions could lead to problems in the new administration. Mr. Barrow has dismissed his predecessor?s supporters as a minority. Most of all, many residents said they were weary of the regional troops who were still roaming the capital. They had arrived at the statehouse to search it and make sure all was safe for Mr. Barrow?s return, but their presence on the streets was unsettling to many. Mr. Barrow?s aides said the soldiers were likely to remain in Gambia for weeks as the new administration makes the transition. Some Gambians worried that it was still too early for Mr. Barrow to come home. ?Yahya Jammeh was not acting alone,? said Ishmael Ceesay, 24, a mobile phone salesman in Serekunda. ?His people are still around. ? Mr. Barrow?s aides said the president would stay at a private residence until the regional troops finished securing the statehouse. Mr. Jammeh?s rule penetrated the psyche of many Gambians who feared him, so much so that thousands fled years ago. Their departure further damaged an already shaky economy that Mr. Barrow has said will be a priority for him. Mr. Jammeh jailed journalists and his opponents, some of whom died in prison, carried out hunts for people believed to be witches and forced patients to stop taking medication so he could test what he said was his homemade cure for AIDS  ?   herbs, prayers and a banana. Residents of Gambia talked about Mr. Jammeh only in hushed tones, and rarely in public, and even some members of the diaspora said they were convinced he was monitoring their communications. Mohamed Jalloh, who sells fabric at the entrance to the statehouse, said he had spent the past two decades praying a bullet would not come flying toward him. ?Yahya Jammeh brought so much fear in us,? Mr. Jalloh said. The paranoia was evident even this week, with Mr. Jammeh hundreds of miles away, when a Gambian newspaper reported that he had left toxins in the vents in the statehouse to poison his successor. Mr. Barrow?s team said the report was false. For many Gambians, the pain of Mr. Jammeh?s rule was all too real. Some residents said part of Mr. Barrow?s new job would be comforter in chief. Mr. Barrow has vowed to create a truth and reconciliation commission to look into injustices during Mr. Jammeh?s more than   administration. On Wednesday afternoon in Brikama, the region where Mr. Barrow received the most votes, three women sat on a long wooden bench. They wore yellow #GambiaHasDecided   a motto adopted by the opposition that wanted Mr. Jammeh to leave. Like many others across Gambia, each of the women said a relative had been killed by security forces loyal to Mr. Jammeh. As they sold sugar at the market, the three spoke of their losses. It was during the 2011 presidential election campaign that Nyima Jabang?s father, an ambulance driver, was tortured and killed while in custody at the National Intelligence Agency. His crime: driving two men to a hospital who had been wounded at a rally in a clash between Mr. Jammeh?s party and the main opposition party, the United Democratic Party. The next day, the brother of Nyima Sanyang, another of the friends selling sugar, was arrested by security forces in connection with the campaign clash and was beaten to death. The third woman, Bintu Sonko, 30, described the long, speeding motorcades that carried Mr. Jammeh and his aides, who would toss packets of cookies to supporters. In 2013, Ms. Sonko?s son, Lamine, 7, heard Mr. Jammeh?s cars approaching. He ran out with his friends to wave to the passing president. Lamine darted into the street to catch a cookie and was struck and killed by a car in the motorcade. ?They did not even stop,? Ms. Sonko said. ?They kept going and throwing cookies at the rest of the kids. We can?t even report the matter to the chief or the police. ? ?That was my only child. ?"
18348,Rebecca R. Ruiz,7/02/2017,2017,2,politics,"Russia will almost certainly be barred from this summer?s track and field world championships, global officials for the sport said Monday, citing the nation?s response to its doping scandal, which they called inadequate. The officials met in Monaco on Monday and voted unanimously to maintain the ban on Russian athletes, outlining a timetable under which the nation would not be cleared to compete until November. Until then, individual Russian athletes with robust histories of drug testing may petition to compete as neutral athletes, unassociated with any country, in the world championships, which will take place in August in London, as well as other global events. Officials agreed to exempt Russia?s youngest athletes from the blanket ban, allowing for those under 15 to compete as neutral individuals without filing a special application. Citing a number of issues  ?   including ?unhelpful comments? by Russia?s deputy prime minister, Vitaly Mutko limited and problematic drug testing within the country and evidence that an implicated coach had continued to train athletes in spite of having been suspended  ?   Rune Andersen, the chairman of a global task force overseeing Russia?s reform, said the nation had not yet met the conditions for reinstatement. Among those conditions is that Russia?s national antidoping agency be fully recertified by the World   Agency, the global regulator of drugs in sports. That agency has suggested it may grant Russia partial certification in May, track officials said Monday, and full certification in November. Only after that point, Mr. Andersen said, would track and field authorities consider restoring Russia to good standing. ?The criteria were very clear,? said Sebastian Coe, president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, track and field?s global governing body. ?They were unambiguous. They were not suffused in politics. ? Mr. Coe and Mr. Andersen said there had been some progress in Russia in recent months, including the election of a new president of Russian track and field, Dmitry Shlyakhtin. They said they had been reassured that Russia would cooperate with France?s continuing criminal investigation, which focuses on bribery and corruption in global track and field, and that the Russian government would provide financial support to national antidoping operations without interfering in them. Mr. Mutko, Russia?s deputy prime minister and former sports minister, has acknowledged broad problems with doping but denied a   system of cheating. Since his promotion by President Vladimir V. Putin last fall, Mr. Mutko has grown increasingly defiant in responding to the mountain of evidence that Russia has systematically doped with government assistance, most notably at the 2014 Sochi Olympics  ?   where Russia?s longtime national antidoping lab chief, Grigory Rodchenkov, said he substituted   urine with clean urine. In December, after WADA laid bare the results of a   investigation, Mr. Mutko went so far as to say that female Russian hockey players who competed at the Sochi Games had been found to have male D. N. A. in their urine samples because they had had sex. Scientific experts dismissed that explanation as impossible, calling it clear evidence of sample tampering. Another condition of Russia?s reinstatement highlighted on Monday in Monaco was that the nation?s leadership accept, or credibly rebut, the extensive evidence of   cheating, including the involvement of the sports ministry and Russia?s federal security service, or F. S. B. ?The question of apologies is one that we have raised every time we have been to Moscow,? Mr. Andersen said Monday. ?In general, I wouldn?t pinpoint any specific person that needs to say apologies,? he said. ?But we expect that the Russian community is acknowledging that they have a problem, because only when you acknowledge you have a problem can you do something about it. ? In December, several Russian sports officials told The New York Times they were no longer disputing the cheating schemes that had been uncovered, though they insisted top government officials had no part in them. ?Of course it was an institutional conspiracy, but not ? said Anna Antseliovich, the acting director general of Russia?s national antidoping agency. While Russia remains barred, 35 Russian athletes have so far petitioned to participate in global competitions in 2017, track officials said Monday. They include Yuliya Stepanova, a   runner and   who helped ignite the Russian doping scandal and who is living in hiding in the United States. Ms. Stepanova ran as a neutral athlete in a global indoor competition in Boston late last month. ?There have been some subtle shifts, and I think there is a recognition that this clearly has been a very disfiguring episode in Russian sport,? Mr. Coe said. ?I?m encouraged, but I?m not cavalier about the amount of work that there still remains to be done. ? Also on Monday, Mr. Coe announced a freeze on nationality transfers, seeking to protect athletes  ?   especially those from Africa, he said  ?   from changes in allegiance before a new set of rules was in place. ?What we have is a wholesale market for African talent open to the highest bidder,? Hamad Kalkaba Malboum, a track and field official representing Africa, said Monday. ?Our present rules are being manipulated to the detriment of athletics? credibility. ?"
18323,Guy Trebay,6/02/2017,2017,2,business,"?An idea is a good thing,? Ken Downing, the fashion director of Neiman Marcus, said on Tuesday, as he bolted in his biker jacket and skinny jeans from one show to another. ?But a theme can scare me running away. ? Despite everyone?s best efforts to shut out the world beyond New York Fashion Week: Men?s, a unifying theme emerged: the parlous state of current politics. It didn?t matter that the visitors to the Skylight Clarkson North event space in Lower Manhattan, where most of the shows were held, tried to drink away their worries at the cozy VIP Amazon Lounge or escaped into chatter about Alejandro Gmez Palomo, a young Spanish designer who shocked the front row with a show featuring men in frilly frocks or talked about the head of Ralph Lauren being unceremoniously shoved into the oubliette. Of the dozens of designers interviewed during a   marathon that ended on Thursday, not one failed to volunteer some expression of concern, anxiety, perplexity or stark anger about the barrage of executive orders, tweets and statements recently issued from the White House. ?It?s hitting people like a dagger in the heart,? the designer John Varvatos said moments before his best men?s wear show in years, at the Diamond Horseshoe nightclub in Midtown. Mr. Varvatos was referring to President Trump?s order banning the entry of citizens from seven   nations and refugees from any country. ?People are in disbelief,? Mr. Varvatos said. ?Half the people in my company are from someplace else. ? So, it would seem, are half the personnel in the industry. Consider the major designers anchoring a men?s wear fashion week now in its fourth iteration and gaining strength in terms of its offerings and the breadth of representation. Mr. Varvatos, for example, is a   American whose parents migrated from Greece and settled in Detroit. The   Ralph Lauren is the son of Askhenazi Jewish immigrants from Belarus. Raised in South Boston, Joseph Abboud was born in the United States to Maronite Christian parents who, seeking greater opportunity, fled Lebanon for America. Even the virtuosic   Raf Simons  ?   whose finely calibrated collection of satiny topcoats, boxy jackets and slouchy woolens was shown on Wednesday night  ?   has only recently transposed his    label to New York, where he also serves as chief creative officer of Calvin Klein. Notably, Mr. Simons chose as the locale for his debut on these shores a Gagosian Gallery, which is run by the   art world powerhouse Larry Gagosian, a California native whose grandparents were immigrants from Armenia. It is not only the big guns who can boast of a hyphenated heritage. The Ovadia twins, Ariel and Shimon, moved to Brooklyn from Israel in the early 1990s. The slick show they presented on Tuesday to an audience peppered with   stars and athletes was inspired, as Ariel said backstage, by a soccer obsession they share with their father, a man who got his start in the garment business selling children?s wear from the back of a   Oldsmobile. A relative newcomer to fashion, Willy Chavarria presented a sublimely deadpan collection on Thursday that he titled ?Brown Power? and showed on a group of   models that included a young trans woman and a Honduran food deliveryman. The clothes were inspired, Mr. Chavarria said, by Chicano youths in California towns like the one in the San Joaquin Valley where he was raised, a son of Mexican immigrants who worked in the agricultural fields. ?The political moment is hard,? Mr. Chavarria said, over the   din of recorded   at his presentation. ?But it?s also a call to action for a generation that maybe got a little lazy. It?s up to us now to be harder ourselves  ?   to love harder, to fight harder, to come hard with our ideas. ? Ideas, as Mr. Downing said, are good things. And, as it happened, the week was rife with them. There were Mr. Chavarria?s supersize denim trousers, his   coats of fur or washable alpaca, his knit caps discreetly embroidered with a rebuke to hate speech too coarse to be printed here and his athletic sweatshirts emblazoned with the timely: ?Gender Bender Super Bawl Champions. ? There were Mr. Simons?s innovative, oversize intarsia sweaters, developed in collaboration with the Woolmark Company, featuring hems that rode up at the back, kangaroo pockets on the chest and, in some cases, a vaguely ambivalent interpretation of Milton Glaser?s ?I ? NY? logo. There was a Ralph Lauren Purple Label collection that gave scant indication that his company is in the midst of what one analyst called ?brand confusion. ? Seldom bested as a conjurer of narrative fantasy during the   he has been in business, Mr. Lauren made it clear that his Gatsbyesque vision still has legs. Here he reimagined a young man of wealth as having humor enough to leave the house wearing a black satin dinner jacket whose subtle jacquard pattern depicts cowboys riding bucking broncos  ?   an image copied from a vintage sleeping bag  ?   and confident enough in his taste to wear a   suit of evening clothes in chocolate corduroy. Barely out of Parsons, Matthew Adams Dolan is already a name to reckon with, largely on the basis of an interest taken in him by a single superfan. ?Rihanna?s team saw my senior thesis and called in some things,? Mr. Dolan, a   native, said modestly on Thursday, as a cluster of models slumped on a dais at the P3 studio at Skylight Clarkson North. ?She gets photographed in them a lot, I guess,? he added, referring to monster denims that resemble the offspring of a Carhartt jacket and a moving blanket. Mr. Dolan?s affection for functional work wear, which he reconfigures in Brobdingnagian proportions, is only half the equation, he said. ?My mom was a big quilter, and that?s been a big influence on me,? he said. That Todd Snyder?s brightest ideas are often not original to him is something of which the designer makes no secret. For years, Mr. Snyder has mined thrift stores and the treasure troves maintained by folks like the   wizard Bob Melet for inspiration. As Mr. Snyder made clear in his Thursday show, his design skill lies in taking the   sports jerseys or the weary,   stadium coats he finds and then  ?   exploiting his savvy way with fabrics and his tailoring background  ?   turning them into covetable stuff like a handsome camel hair overcoat so pilled it looked as though he had skinned a family of teddy bears to create it. The primary idea driving Mr. Varvatos?s latest collection, he said before his show, involved his conviction that millennial men now discovering the suit want something that keeps them from resembling their fathers. ?They want to push out the boundaries,? Mr. Varvatos said. He does, too. With his fall 2017 collection, the designer stuck to a restrained narrow silhouette for taut frock coats, biker jackets, barn coats and     jackets. And he confined his experiments to fabrication. Despite the best efforts of moral philosophers like Peter Singer, fur has been steadily making a comeback. The best designs at the Varvatos show were for things like a lynx print calfskin biker jacket that would make anyone want to become rock star or a flimsy topcoat lined with cropped shearling  ?   just the sort of stuff to give PETA conniptions. It?s easy enough to guess at the outrage triggered in the mind of an   activist by Mr. Varvatos?s wholesale dispatch of livestock. More challenging, perhaps, is imagining what a traditional male might make of the clothes created by Mr. Palomo. Invited to be a guest of the C. F. D. A. the designer  ?   who has generated a lot of press and engendered a small cult following at home  ?   brought with him a group of clothes that seemed relatively tame by his standards. It included trousers, that is, and a few items you might term suits. True, they came in purple satin brocade with   portrait collars or gold lam? with flounces and neck frills or constituted little more than a white satin bustier worn with thigh boots and a pair of   briefs. Of all the many design ideas on display during New York Fashion Week: Men?s, Mr. Palomo?s were by miles the most fantastical and giddy. Yet, as the men?s wear industry has been trudging steadily away from gender fluidity and toward masculinity as historically constituted, the sight of a guy kitted out in Cuban heels, a garter belt, a pair of shiny culottes or a flounced   costume seemed less outrageous than, perhaps, pass?."
18255,Thomas Fuller,3/02/2017,2017,2,crime,"BERKELEY, Calif.  ?   Fires burned in the cradle of free speech. Furious at a lecture organized on campus, demonstrators wearing   outfits smashed windows, threw rocks at the police and stormed a building. The speech? The university called it off. Protest has been synonymous with the University of California, Berkeley, from the earliest days of the free speech movement, when students fought to expand political expression on campus beginning in 1964. Those protests would set off student activism movements that roiled campuses across the country throughout the 1960s. Since then, countless demonstrators have flocked to Sproul Plaza each day to have their voices heard on issues from civil rights and apartheid to Israel, tuition costs and more. But now the university is under siege for canceling a speech by the incendiary   writer Milo Yiannopoulos and words like intolerance, long used by the left, are being used by critics to condemn the protests on Wednesday night that ultimately prevented Mr. Yiannopoulos from speaking. Naweed Tahmas, a junior who is a member of the Berkeley College Republicans, the group that invited Mr. Yiannopoulos to campus, said the cancellation had made him more determined to fight for freedom of speech on campus. ?I?m tired of getting silenced, as many conservative students are,? he said. ?If we support freedom of speech, we should support all speech including what they consider hate speech. ? When the event was canceled, the Republican student group reacted by writing on their Facebook page, ?the Free Speech Movement is dead. ? More than 100 faculty members signed a letter opposing the visit by Mr. Yiannopoulos in recent weeks. ?We support robust debate, but we cannot abide by harassment, slander, defamation, and hate speech,? they wrote. On Thursday, heated arguments broke out at Sproul Plaza between students who said Mr. Yiannopoulos  ?   a provocateur editor at Breitbart News who is known for his attacks on political correctness and offensive,   writing  ?   was too inflammatory to be invited to campus and those who argued that he should have been allowed to speak. The university made it clear they believed the people who resorted to violence on Wednesday night  ?   a group, clad in black clothing and carrying sticks  ?   had come from outside the campus. The university estimated on Thursday that the rioting had caused around $100, 000 in damage. Whatever the origins of the violent mob, the university was and remains divided over the meaning of free speech at a time of national political tumult. ?I think we need to have a serious conversation about protests. This is going to be a big part of our lives for the next four years,? said Kirsten Pickering, a graduate student at the university. She and others described the violence as a ?potential teachable moment. ? ?We need to sit down and talk about what is acceptable,? she added. Troy Worden, a   student and a member of the College Republicans, said he would ?absolutely? invite Mr. Yiannopoulos to speak on campus again, and Mr. Tahmas added that the Republican student group is a racially diverse group that does not consider Mr. Yiannopoulos to be a white nationalist. Criticism of the decision to cancel the speech came from outside the university as well. On Twitter early on Thursday, President Trump went as far as to threaten withholding federal funds from the university for failing to stop ?violence on people with a different point of view. ? Mr. Yiannopoulos has cultivated a sizable following among the     movement with his speaking events, podcast interviews and articles. He travels around California on a tour bus airbrushed with his likeness. Since embarking in September on his speaking tour of American campuses, he has been trailed by protests. But the events have also attracted pockets of   anarchists clad in face masks and spoiling for a fight. Some university organizers withdrew invitations to Mr. Yiannopoulos over security concerns. At the University of California, Davis, on Jan. 13, his speech was canceled as it was set to begin after a tense standoff between protesters and police officers. A week later, on Inauguration Day, a man was shot during protests outside Mr. Yiannopoulos?s speech at the University of Washington in Seattle. He was to cap his tour this week at Berkeley. In the weeks leading up to the event, campus administrators faced tremendous pressure from student groups and faculty members to cancel it. In a video of himself posted on Facebook after the cancellation on Wednesday night, Mr. Yiannopoulos criticized the ?hard left, which has become so utterly antithetical to free speech in the last few years. ? ?They simply will not allow any speaker on campus, even somebody as silly and harmless and gay as me to have their voice heard,? he added. One group that has been outspoken in favor of allowing Mr. Yiannopoulos to speak is the veterans of the university?s free speech movement. ?I?m really a little fatigued with all of this, ?Oh my goodness, cover my ears, someone will say something that will upset me, I can?t tolerate that,? ? said Jack Radey, who was a    activist during the original free speech movement at Berkeley. ?There are racists, sexists, piggery of various kinds who will say really terrible things. And that is part of the world,? Mr. Radey said by telephone from Oregon, where he is retired. ?Learn how to fight back. Don?t say, ?Oh, no. We can?t allow someone to speak because someone might be offended.? ? In a letter to The Daily Californian, Berkeley?s student newspaper, Mr. Radey and other members of the Free Speech Movement Archive board of directors, a grouping of some of the movement?s activists, said Mr. Yiannopoulos was ?a bigot who comes to campus spouting vitriol so as to attract attention to himself. ? But they said free speech was paramount. ?Berkeley?s free speech tradition, won through struggle  ?   suspension, arrest, fines, jail time  ?   by Free Speech Movement activists is far more important than Yiannopoulos, and it is that tradition?s endurance that concerns us,? they wrote."
17536,David E. Sanger and Matt Flegenheimer,11/01/2017,2017,1,crime,"WASHINGTON  ?   The director of the F. B. I. James B. Comey, told lawmakers at a Senate hearing on Tuesday that Russian hackers had penetrated the Republican National Committee?s computer records, but he called it a ?limited penetration of old R. N. C. ? computer systems that were ?no longer in use. ? Mr. Comey?s statement was significant because the committee said weeks ago that it did not lose data to the Russians because of its strong cybersecurity.   Donald J. Trump has repeated that assertion and has also said weaknesses in Democratic National Committee systems had opened the way for their systems to be hacked. While Mr. Comey did not go into detail, he appeared to be referring to a   attack on a contractor in Tennessee, Smartech Corporation, used by the Republican committee to host some of its websites and handle some lists of donors. Federal investigators have said that a single email server used by that contractor had been penetrated. But it was going out of service and contained outdated material that the Russians probably found to be of little value. People with direct knowledge of the server?s contents said it had been used by Senators Lindsey Graham and John McCain. An aide in Mr. Graham?s office said the hacking of the email server in question occurred in June. The Graham campaign was using the server to send news clips and campaign releases, the aide said. In an unclassified report released on Friday, the intelligence community reported that the Russians had attacked ? ? organizations but that they had chosen not to make any of that data public. The report made no specific reference to the Republican National Committee. Pressed on the issue by Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, Mr. Comey said on Tuesday that there was ?evidence of hacking directed at the state level? and at the Republican committee, ?but that it was old stuff. ? He said there was no evidence ?that the current R. N. C. ?  ?   he appeared to be referring to servers at the committee?s headquarters or contractors with current data  ?   had been hacked. There is no evidence that computers used by the Trump campaign or the Clinton campaign were also compromised, though the personal email account of John D. Podesta, Hillary Clinton?s campaign chairman, was copied and released as part of the   hack. The testimony on Tuesday was the first since the release of the declassified report on Russia?s interference in the 2016 presidential election, and it came four days after the findings were described to Mr. Trump. The panel, convened by the Senate Intelligence Committee, included James R. Clapper Jr. the director of national intelligence, and Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the head of the National Security Agency and of the military?s Cyber Command. John O. Brennan, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and Mr. Comey also testified. Mr. Clapper largely repeated the conclusions of last week?s report, including that the goal of the Russian effort was to disparage Mrs. Clinton  ?   whom the Russians hoped to weaken if she won  ?   and over time to favor Mr. Trump. Under questioning, Mr. Clapper said he believed that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and his aides had actively ordered the operation that resulted in the hacking, though he left unclear how involved they may have been in the details. After receiving a briefing on the report on Friday, Mr. Trump acknowledged for the first time that Russia had sought to hack into the Democratic National Committee?s computer systems. But he insisted that the effort had played no role in his election, and he said nothing about the conclusion that Mr. Putin preferred him to Mrs. Clinton. Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia and the committee?s vice chairman, called the election hacking ?one of the most serious events of my public life. ? At times, Democrats on the committee steered the conversation toward whether intelligence officials were investigating any link between the Russians and Mr. Trump?s campaign. But Mr. Comey declined to discuss it. ?Especially in a public forum, we never confirm or deny any investigation,? Mr. Comey said. Many Democrats still blame him for Mrs. Clinton?s defeat, citing his ambiguous letter less than two weeks before the election disclosing new questions about emails on her private server. Senator Angus King, independent of Maine, who supported Mrs. Clinton, could not resist an aside. ?The irony of your making that statement here I cannot avoid,? he said. Mr. Comey, seeking to establish a nonpartisan air, later joked, ?I hope I?ve demonstrated by now I?m tone deaf when it comes to politics  ?   and that?s the way it should be. ? Republicans, for their part, raised few doubts about the intelligence community?s conclusions, but they dwelled little on the report?s finding that Mr. Putin had a clear preference for Mr. Trump. Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, suggested that Russia had achieved its broader goal of sowing ?chaos and disorder? in the electoral system."
17945,Jeremy Egner,26/01/2017,2017,1,crime,"Mary Tyler Moore, who died on Wednesday at 80, had a   career in show business. But she is most remembered for two indelible sitcom roles: Laura Petrie on ?The Dick Van Dyke Show? and later, Mary Richards on ?The Mary Tyler Moore Show. ? [ Read Mary Tyler Moore?s obituary | 5 great episodes to stream ] Ms. Moore first appeared in The New York Times in 1962, during the first season of ?The Dick Van Dyke Show,? which ran from 1961 to 1966. A reporter interviewed her during a brief trip to New York to   CBS executives and affiliates. (?When they saw Mary, there was quite a bit of applause and a few whistles,? a network spokesman said.) By 1965 the show was a hit and Ms. Moore was a star. The writer Joanne Stang called her the ?virtually uncontested popularity queen of weekly television,? marveling that Ms. Moore ?has made housewifery a highly palatable pastime. ? ?I guess they simply like me,? Ms. Moore said in the article. At the time she was preparing to try to leverage her TV success into a film career, having recently signed a contract with Universal. But she was similarly   about her prospects. ?If I don?t have the chemistry for the big screen, I guess I?ll look for something else to do when the ?Van Dyke Show? goes off,? she said. Ms. Moore did appear in films like ?Thoroughly Modern Millie,? ?What?s So Bad About Feeling Good?? and ?Change of Habit,? but it was another television show that became her defining role. ?The Mary Tyler Moore Show,? which Ms. Moore produced with her   Grant Tinker, debuted in 1970, arriving in an era whose social mores were signified by the groaner headline The Times used to introduce it and other new   series: ?Out of the Kitchen, Ladies. ? Early coverage was similarly dismissive: ?Mary Tyler Moore is caught in a preposterous item about life as an ?associate producer? in a TV newsroom,? Jack Gould wrote in The Times in a preview of the 1970 TV season. In his brief review of ?The Mary Tyler Moore Show,? Mr. Gould complained that the star was saddled with ?one set of bizarre happenings at a TV station?s newsroom and another in her living accommodations. ? But within a few years, The Times had reconsidered its stance. ?Consistently tight writing and good acting have made this situation comedy the best of its kind in the history of American television,? Dan Menaker wrote in 1973. The following year, The Times was revealing ?Why 30 Million Are Mad About Mary. ? (The answer: She is ?beautiful and sexy, but not threatening. ?) As the show wrapped up its run, during which it had broken ground in prime time with its depiction of a single professional woman, an Associated Press article in The Times noted that the show ?laid to rest the myth that audiences would not accept a situation comedy involving a woman, unless she was married and burned dinner at least one night a week. ? ?I?m just part of it,? Ms. Moore said in the article. ?But it really has affected a lot of people, all to the good. ? Ms. Moore?s career never again reached the heights of ?The Mary Tyler Moore Show,? but she stayed busy branching out into musicals and additional,   series, and playing against plucky type in TV movies and films like ?Ordinary People? and ?Flirting With Disaster. ? In the twilight of her career, as the lifetime achievement awards started rolling in, she embraced her signature role in lighthearted reunion specials and in the occasional interview. In 2012, Neil Genzlinger, a television critic for The Times, watched the series finale of ?The Mary Tyler Moore Show? with the actress, who apologized in advance for a watery eye that had been plaguing her. ?As we finished,? Mr. Genzlinger wrote, ?Ms. Moore reached for the tissue box. ?Now I am crying,? she said. ?It?s not just a bad eye. ??"
17458,Salamishah Tillet,15/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"Some of the most fascinating conversations about class anxiety aren?t happening on cable news networks these days but on a more unexpected place on television: shows like ?Atlanta,? ? ? and ?Insecure,? which have explored a profound, if largely ignored, economic issue  ?   black downward mobility. On ?? the Johnson family is led by Dre, a marketing executive, and Bow, a doctor. They have four children in private school and a house in an affluent, predominantly white neighborhood in Los Angeles. They took a vacation to Disney World estimated to cost more than $20, 000. But despite the family?s seeming stability, ? ? is largely about class tension. A central dilemma is Dre?s battle between his financial aspirations and racial authenticity, his    and his loyalty to his   roots. One of the best episodes this season, ?Jack of All Trades,? opens with Dre (Anthony Anderson) and Bow (Tracee Ellis Ross) learning of their young twins? career test results: Diane (Marsai Martin) might be in a ?position of power in a political organization,? while Jack (Miles Brown) is likely to be ?a member of a unionized group of skilled laborers. ? Despite Jack?s obvious excitement about, and talent for, the manual trades, his parents become obsessed with redirecting his career trajectory, worried that he will be pigeonholed, like Dre?s   father, Pops (Laurence Fishburne) in a   job for the rest of his life. As Pop?s presence reminds us, while Dre?s parents worked hard to provide him with an education, Dre did not inherit wealth, making his    status both new and fragile. This is a legitimate worry because more and more members of the   middle class are finding themselves in an economic downslide, with little hope that the next generation will earn more than the one before. In 2015, the Pew Research Center released a report detailing that the number of American households earning a   income had reached its lowest point in over 40 years. And the gap between the wealth of white and black families has widened to its highest level since 1989, according to a Pew report from 2014. Black male children raised in   households in the late 1970s and early ?80s have fallen out of the middle class at particularly higher rates than white male children after becoming adults, another Pew report found. On shows like Donald Glover?s ?Atlanta? on FX and Issa Rae?s ?Insecure? on HBO, both about a group of    professionally striving and financially struggling (and both, along with ?? nominated for Golden Globes) the theme of black downward mobility is put into high relief. ?Comedy in the black community is almost always about struggle,? said Mary Pattillo, author of ?Black Picket Fences: Privilege and Peril Among the Black Middle Class. ? ?And while exploring class differences is not new for black sitcoms, it is important that these themes are reproduced and restaged for each generation. The specifics might be different, but every generation returns to this theme because the precarity of the black middle class has not disappeared. ? On ?Atlanta,? we meet Earn, a Princeton dropout who grew up in a   family and who works at an airport kiosk. He quits that job to manage his cousin, an    rapper named Alfred Miles, known as Paper Boi (Brian Tyree Henry) who has a song on the radio but makes a living as a drug dealer. Earn?s economic instability is exacerbated when his    girlfriend and his daughter?s mother, Van (Zazie Beetz) loses her job as an elementary schoolteacher because it was the only constant source of income for the family. ??Atlanta? offers up a realistic portrait of the vulnerability that the black middle class faces today,? said Jessica S. Welburn, a sociologist at the University of Iowa who researches   downward mobility. ?While the election of the first   president gives many a sense of progress, racial disparities have also intensified and limited what has typically been a pathway to the middle class for   like a college degree or a government job. Knowing this,   still try to break through these barriers with obviously mixed results. ? ?The Jacket,? the season finale of ?Atlanta,? offers up one of the most pointed critiques of structural racism that I have seen on television this year: Neither Earn?s   childhood nor his Princeton education can protect him from the constraints that he and his friends find themselves under. After Earn wakes up in a strange house in a strange bed without his jacket, we follow him on an increasingly desperate search in increasingly dangerous situations. He finally arrives outside the home of the Uber driver who has his jacket, only to witness him being shot by the police. As extraordinary as that trauma might be for most Americans, the show portrays the sort of everyday violence to which   and Latinos, of various classes, are vulnerable. If race is intimately tied to class, so is gender, as Ms. Rae?s ?Insecure? so poignantly reminds us. The main conflict on the series is its female protagonists, Issa and her best friend, Molly (Yvonne Orji) navigating the muddy waters of millennial dating. We first meet Issa, who works at a nonprofit, and her     boyfriend, Lawrence (Jay Ellis) on shaky ground. Despite his Georgetown degree, Lawrence is an entrepreneur unable to finalize his business plan or find a corporate job. He settles on working at Best Buy, and later, with encouragement from Issa, sets aside his dream of developing an app to take a gig at a tech  . And while the season concludes with a   breakup, their relationship was perhaps doomed from the beginning, by his inertia, his unemployment and their economic insecurity. Through Molly, a lawyer who brilliantly   between corporate and colloquial vernacular, the show explores how class mobility often differs for   women and men. After a string of disappointing romantic encounters, Molly ends up dating Jared (Langston Kerman) a witty, caring guy whom Issa jokingly calls ?  ? because he works at Enterprise. Molly ends their relationship (the first of two times) after she and her friends find out he did not attend college. Averil Y. Clarke, author of ?Inequalities of Love:   Black Women and the Barriers to Romance and Family,? said: ?  black women are plagued by a very common racial problem. They, like most women, are encouraged to pursue the   script: Go to college, get a good job and get married and have kids. ? She added, ?But, when it comes to dating, black women?s class aspirations are more likely to be unfulfilled than white women, their femininity and sense of value more likely to feel under assault. ? Historically, whether it was the striving of ?The Jeffersons? or ?The Fresh Prince of  ? or the   settings of shows like ?Sanford and Son,? ?Roc? or ?Thea,? class differences have dominated black sitcoms in the    era. That these three recent shows are all created by   (Kenya Barris created ? ?) might enable them to attend differently to these nuances of   lives. Ms. Rae said in an interview with Vox, ?This isn?t a show exclusively about, like, the struggle of being black. ? Instead, ?It?s just regular black people living life. ? By setting her show in South Los Angeles, she is able to reveal the spectrum of   class diversity, as she noted in an interview with The Daily Beast: ?Yes, there?s poverty there, there are gang members there, but there?s also affluence, there?s middle class, and everybody meshes together. ? Likewise, Mr. Glover said in an interview with Vulture, ?I wanted to show white people, you don?t know everything about black culture. ? In that same interview, he underscores that one key difference is how he depicts class diversity. When Mr. Glover heard a suggestion that Paper Boi live in a   ?traplike? home, he refused. ?We were like: ?No, he?s a drug dealer, he makes enough money to live in a regular apartment. ?? He added, ?There were some things so subtle and black that people had no idea what we were talking about. ? Taken together, these sitcoms remind us of the centrality of race, not just to our conversations but to policies around income inequality. That the coming years may yield a hiring freeze on the federal work force, the continuing decline of unions, and more suffering for both   and     is no laughing matter. But, as the adage goes: Sometimes we simply have to laugh to keep from crying."
18051,Christopher Clarey,29/01/2017,2017,1,sports,"MELBOURNE, Australia  ?   Serena Williams was utterly unaware that a victory on Saturday night would put her back at No. 1. Her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, did all he could to keep her in the dark. But there was no hiding the other statistical stakes as Williams walked back into Rod Laver Arena, headphones around her neck and   in place, to play her older sister Venus Williams in the Australian Open final. The tennis circuit can be an echo chamber where the same questions and themes reverberate from week to week as the locations change, but the protagonists do not. So even if Serena Williams refused to entertain questions during the tournament about the possibility of winning her 23rd Grand Slam singles title and breaking her tie for the   record with Steffi Graf, there was no dodging that number in her own head. Now, after her     victory over her sister, she can celebrate No. 23 instead of fret over it. ?I?ve been chasing it for a really long time,? Williams said. ?When it got on my radar, I knew I had an opportunity to get there, and I?m here. It?s a great feeling. No better place to do it than Melbourne. ? She and her sister made their first visit to Melbourne in 1998. They were teenagers with braces on their teeth and braids in their hair and a clear sense that they were special, but no idea of just how far their talents and confidence would carry them. Much has changed in 19 years. Rod Laver Arena now has a wraparound digital screen at court level and electronic line calling. The court, once green, is now a deep blue. The beads and the braces are long gone, but the sisters? power tennis remains. And though their father, Richard Williams, in one of the great sports predictions, saw the future clearly when he said the younger, fiercer Serena would turn out to be the better player, perhaps not even he realized how wide the gap would eventually grow. Serena Williams now has 23 major singles titles to her sister?s seven, and has won seven of their nine Grand Slam finals and eight of their last nine matches. Those figures brook no argument. Williams 2. 0 has the better operating system when it comes to locating the lines and creating the angles under the greatest pressure. She also has the purer service motion. But Williams 1. 0 certainly gave it her all Saturday night, throwing herself into the groundstrokes and displaying more emotion when a return struck the net or a rally failed than she has perhaps ever shown in a major final. ?It was palpable how much Venus wanted it,? said Isha Price, the Williamses? half sister. An   final is always an emotionally complex affair, which is all the more reason to admire how the older sister has so often handled the disappointments. ?That?s my little sister, guys,? Venus Williams said, pointing at Serena during the   ceremony. She then spoke to her sister directly. It was quite a riff. ?Congratulations, Serena, on No. 23,? Williams said. ?I have been there right with you. Some of them I lost right there against you. I guess that?s weird, but it?s been an awesome thing. Your win has always been my win. I think you know that. And all the time I couldn?t be there, wouldn?t be there, didn?t get there, you were there. I?m enormously proud of you. You mean the world to me. ? Serena Williams is now within one victory of Margaret Court?s career record of 24 Grand Slam singles titles. ?Good on her if she?s good enough to do it,? Court said during the week in Melbourne. Williams has closed in on Court with an unprecedented run of success at an age when most great women?s tennis players of the past had already retired. Graf, for example, was done by 30. But Williams has now won 10 major singles title since turning 30. On Saturday, she became the oldest woman to win a Grand Slam singles title in the Open era, breaking her own record set at Wimbledon last year. Venus, 36, was the oldest Australian Open finalist in the Open era. ?There?s no way I would be at 23 without her there?s no way I would be at 1 without her,? Serena Williams said of her sister in the   ceremony. ?There?s no way I would have anything without her. She?s my inspiration. She?s the only reason I?m standing here today, and the only reason that the Williams sisters exist. So thank you, Venus, for inspiring me to be the best player I could be and inspiring me to work hard. Every time you won this week, I felt like I?ve got to win, too. ? This final was edgy from the start, beginning with four straight breaks of serve and with Serena Williams angrily breaking a racket in just the third game after she lost her footing trying to change direction when one of her sister?s shots struck the net cord. The quality of play fluctuated considerably, but the match ultimately was determined by Serena Williams?s returns. Venus Williams had won over 50 percent of the points on her second serve in her surprise run to the final. She won just 29 percent Saturday. ?Serena always expects a tough match against her sister, but I don?t think she expected it to be quite that tough from the start,? Mouratoglou said. At 35, Williams is back on top after playing little in 2016 except for the Grand Slam events and losing the No. 1 ranking to Angelique Kerber, who defeated her in last year?s Australian Open final. Williams looked shocked when it was announced after her victory that she would return to No. 1. Mouratoglou later explained, a tad sheepishly, that he had not answered truthfully when Serena had inquired about it. He said he wanted to avoid putting extra pressure on her at an already fraught moment. ?Actually, I think she?s happy I did it now,? he said. The Open could easily have gone awry for Serena Williams. In her return to the circuit earlier this month at a tournament in Auckland, New Zealand, she was upset in her second match by Madison Brengle, making 88 unforced errors on a blustery day. But Williams has often proved that she can click into a higher gear without much match play, and she did not drop a set in seven matches as she won her seventh Australian Open singles title. Venus Williams, seeded 13th here, remains one of the great players of this era, but she has not won a major singles title since she beat Serena to win Wimbledon in 2008. In the intervening years, she received a diagnosis of Sjogren?s syndrome, an autoimmune disorder, that limited her training and contributed to her falling from the top 100 in 2011. But she has learned to manage her health problems and is having a   renaissance that might be a much bigger talking point if it were not for her younger sister?s   surge. Venus Williams will be at No. 11 in Monday?s WTA rankings. The sisters have become, through experience, adept at compartmentalizing, even if facing each other across the net is still not entirely natural. Their family members struggle with it, too. Their parents, Richard Williams and Oracene Price, did not make the long journey to Melbourne this year, but Isha Price did. And she decided that she preferred to watch the match at her hotel until it was nearly over instead of putting herself through the crucible of watching in person. ?Long story short, I don?t think people actually understand the significance of what they see, these two players, who literally for generations have been able to transcend what they do,? Price said. ?And it?s very difficult to watch, listen, hear commentary, all of that. We watch tennis on mute. It?s hard. To keep your body in optimal shape to be able to perform at this level consistently over 20 years is an incredible feat. But you still have the conversation where it?s not enough. ? It is becoming increasingly difficult to quibble with the record books, however. Serena keeps moving the bar higher, but the poignant part on Saturday night, was that despite all of Venus?s talent and staying power and eloquence, only one Williams sister has managed to win the singles championship at Melbourne Park."
17851,Quentin Hardy,21/01/2017,2017,1,technology,"SAN FRANCISCO  ?   By mastering some tough computer chip technology and then pulling off an audacious business strategy based on selling its smartphone knowledge, Qualcomm has made billions of dollars and seized influence in the tech industry. Some days that is a real drag. On Friday, Apple, its longtime partner, sued Qualcomm over what it said was $1 billion in withheld rebates. In the lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court for the Southern District of California, in San Diego, Apple said the money had been promised in conjunction with an agreement not to buy chips from other suppliers or to divulge Qualcomm?s intellectual property licensing practices. The suit seeks the rebates, among other things. Apple sued three days after the  Federal Trade Commission accused Qualcomm of using anticompetitive practices to guarantee its high royalty payments for advanced wireless technology. The commission cited Qualcomm?s deals with Taiwanese companies that manufacture Apple iPhones over semiconductors it sells for the iPhone. In its complaint, the commission described Qualcomm as ?the world?s dominant supplier? of semiconductors that manage smartphone communications. The commission said Qualcomm had obtained ?elevated royalties? for its patented intellectual property on wireless communications. Other smartphone chip makers have to pay Qualcomm for that intellectual property, too. The commission and Apple complaints follow several other problems, including a $975 million fine by Chinese regulators in 2015 and activist shareholder complaints later that year that forced layoffs at Qualcomm. Last month, Qualcomm was fined $850 million in South Korea for unfair patent licensing. When Apple provided information to South Korean regulators in that case, and sought competing chips from Intel, Qualcomm refused to pay Apple its promised money, Apple said. Qualcomm has vowed to fight the South Korean charge and the F. T. C. suit. ?Apple has intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations,? Qualcomm said in a statement, adding that it would fight that lawsuit, too. Few expect Qualcomm to back down. It was shaped by its founders to be brainy, combative and profitable. ?They are seasoned, and equipped to fight,? said Mark Hung, an analyst at Gartner. ?But when such a big company is so reliant on the way it sells its intellectual property, and under the microscope in various geographies, it?s tough. ? Qualcomm, which is based in San Diego, far from Silicon Valley, was founded in 1985 by seven people, including Irwin Jacobs and Andrew Viterbi. The two were   electrical engineering professors who had formed a military satellite communications company. Qualcomm?s engineers work at a   campus between a park and the University of California, San Diego. They have earned thousands of patents, including for the airplane mode on smartphones and the way apps are downloaded from stores. Companies like Samsung and Apple need Qualcomm for the technology that enables things like   wireless video for millions of people at once. Its major technology is spread spectrum, which harnesses lots of computation and clever radio engineering for use in the various functions of smartphones. Qualcomm?s radio technology is called CDMA, for code division multiple access, a way voice calls work more efficiently over cellphone networks. And the company?s influence grew over the last several years with the advent of   or 3G, phones as people started downloading lots of mobile data as well as making calls. At the time, many thought Qualcomm?s success would be limited to that transition. Instead, Qualcomm innovated in 4G wireless for the new smartphones from Samsung and Apple that toppled Nokia and Motorola. In its last fiscal year, Qualcomm had revenue of $23. 6 billion and a profit of $5. 7 billion. Qualcomm?s ventures in phones and network gear helped promote CDMA but did not make much money because older companies did not need CDMA until the success of wireless began to tax the capacity of their networks. Qualcomm turned to Asian companies that wanted to get into wireless. ?You?d never have seen the Koreans or the Chinese in wireless if not for Qualcomm and CDMA,? said Clint McClellan, a   employee of Qualcomm who now runs a wireless health business. ?We enabled those markets. ? South Korea, in particular, made CDMA an industrial policy, which carried Qualcomm for years. More recently, China accounted for half of Qualcomm?s revenue. Apple?s Taiwanese manufacturers, which pay Qualcomm royalties for iPhones, are another big profit center. Qualcomm would not say what it charges for its intellectual property, but analysts figure the fee usually amounts to 5 percent of the selling price of a phone  ?   at least it did, until the 2015 Chinese fine, which included an agreement that Chinese manufacturers pay only about half the old Qualcomm royalty. That, and problems collecting Chinese royalties even before the agreement, hurt Qualcomm?s share price. In 2015, Jana Partners, an activist hedge fund, stepped in and pressed for a breakup of the company into separate intellectual property and chip businesses. That did not happen, but Qualcomm cut about 15 percent of its staff, cut executive pay and gave Jana three board seats. The stock has recovered to about where it was just before the fine, but not to the heights it reached before the problems. By helping to create today?s smartphone giants, Qualcomm may have engineered its current woes. Qualcomm executives say they see a connection between the China discounts, which Qualcomm had hoped would be limited to that country, and the latest regulatory attacks. ?We believe Samsung had a major role to play in the Korean decision,? said Don Rosenberg, a lawyer for Qualcomm. The regulators, he said, ?were prodded and misled by commercial interests. ? In an email,   Jee, a spokeswoman for Samsung, said it ?was one of many multinational corporations? that responded to questions from South Korean regulators. Qualcomm?s lawyer figures the Korean case may take years to move through the courts. And recent events, including the impeachment of South Korea?s president and a  bribery scandal at Samsung, could complicate, or eliminate, Qualcomm?s regulatory issues there. Additionally, the F. T. C. has just three of its normal five commissioners. One of those, Maureen Ohlhausen, a Republican, voted against the suit. She may be named chairwoman when the current chairwoman, Edith Ramirez, a Democrat, steps down on Feb. 10. Neither the F. T. C. nor Apple would comment on the United States case against Qualcomm. ?It?s disappointing when our partners want to pay less after we?ve contributed to their success,? said Derek Aberle, Qualcomm?s president. Now it must get out ahead of other technology inventors in 5G, possibly while paying billions in fines and dealing with a painful restructuring and fraying relationships with its biggest customers. ?We?re not sitting still? while the problems are sorted, Mr. Aberle said. ?You have to invest, and invent cool stuff that will change the way people live their lives. ? In other words, create unique technology so people will keep paying for Qualcomm?s expensive intellectual property."
18388,Julie Hirschfeld Davis,9/02/2017,2017,2,business,"WASHINGTON  ?   Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, President Trump?s nominee for the Supreme Court, privately expressed dismay on Wednesday over Mr. Trump?s increasingly aggressive attacks on the judiciary, calling the president?s criticism of independent judges ?demoralizing? and ?disheartening. ? The remarks by Judge Gorsuch,  chosen  by Mr. Trump last week to serve on the nation?s highest court, came as the president lashed out at the federal appellate judges who are considering a challenge to his executive order banning travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries. The president called their judicial proceedings ?disgraceful? and described the courts as ?so political. ? Those remarks followed Mr. Trump?s weekend Twitter outburst in which he derided a Seattle district court judge who blocked his travel ban as a ?  judge? whose ?ridiculous? ruling would be overturned. Judge Gorsuch expressed his disappointment with Mr. Trump?s comments about the judiciary in a private conversation with Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, as he paid courtesy calls on Capitol Hill to build support for his confirmation. An account of the discussion was confirmed by a White House adviser working to advance the Gorsuch confirmation, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment. The spectacle of a Supreme Court nominee breaking so starkly with the president who named him underscored the unusual nature of Mr. Trump?s public feud with the judiciary. Speaking to a group of sheriffs and police chiefs on Wednesday, the president said the appellate judges had failed to grasp concepts even ?a bad high school student would understand. ? ?This is highly unusual,? said Michael W. McConnell, a former federal judge who directs the Constitutional Law Center at Stanford University. ?Mr. Trump is shredding longstanding norms of etiquette and interbranch comity. ? Presidents have traditionally tried to refrain from even appearing to intervene in court cases that concern them or their policies, or from impugning the motives and qualifications of jurists charged with deciding them, according to judges and legal experts from across the political spectrum. The tradition is important to preserving the separation of powers that is a pillar of American democracy, establishing an independent judiciary to serve as a check on the executive branch, they argued. Mr. Trump?s rhetorical battle with the judiciary may also end up harming his cause in a case that may end up before the Supreme Court, by potentially stiffening the resolve of judges who feel their independence is under attack. Mr. McConnell called Mr. Trump?s comments ?extremely   and  ? because of their potential to sway judges to rule against Mr. Trump. ?Judges who hear criticism of this sort are not going to be inclined to knuckle under it?s going to stiffen their spines to be even more independent,? said Mr. McConnell, who was nominated to his judgeship by President George W. Bush. Jeffrey Rosen, the president of the National Constitution Center, a nonprofit organization in Philadelphia devoted to explaining the Constitution, said there was a rich history of presidents strongly criticizing judges on matters of law. ?But those criticisms were based on constitutional disagreements about the rulings, and it?s hard to think of a president who has challenged the motives of specific judges by name repeatedly, especially before a case is decided, or used the same kind of invective as Mr. Trump has toward the court,? Mr. Rosen said. ?Judicial independence is a fragile and crucial achievement of American constitutionalism,? he added, ?and it depends on the public seeing the judiciary as something more than politicians in robes. ? Yet Mr. Trump, who as president has the power to nominate members of the federal judiciary, appears bent instead on portraying independent judges who hold the fate of his travel ban in their hands as partisans who refuse to give him the power to which he is entitled to protect the nation. ?I don?t ever want to call a court biased, so I won?t call it biased,? Mr. Trump said on Wednesday. ?But courts seem to be so political, and it would be so great for our justice system if they would be able to read a statement and do what?s right. ? Mr. Trump, who opened his remarks to law enforcement officers reciting the passage of the United States code that gives the president the power to restrict immigration whenever he deems the influx of foreigners detrimental to the country, said he had watched ?in amazement? Tuesday night as a   federal appeals panel heard arguments on his executive order and the limits of presidential power in cases of national security. ?I listened to a bunch of stuff last night on television that was disgraceful,? Mr. Trump said. ?I think it?s sad. I think it?s a sad day. I think our security is at risk today. ? His comments came the morning after a lively, roughly hourlong hearing  ?   the audio of which was carried live on national television  ?   during which three judges on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit expressed skepticism about the arguments of a Justice Department lawyer defending Mr. Trump?s order. Judge James L. Robart of the Federal District Court in Seattle blocked the travel ban on Friday, and the appeals court is considering whether to uphold that action, with a ruling expected as early as Thursday. Mr. Trump took aim at one of the judges without specifying which, saying, ?I will not comment on the statements made by, certainly one judge. ? The panel was made up of Judge William C. Canby Jr. appointed by President Jimmy Carter Judge Richard R. Clifton, named by Mr. Bush and Judge Michelle T. Friedland, nominated by President Barack Obama. ?If these judges wanted to, in my opinion, help the court in terms of respect for the court, they?d do what they should be doing,? Mr. Trump said. ?It?s so sad. ? By contrast, he lavished praise on Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton, a federal district judge in Boston who last week ruled that the travel ban could stay in place. ?Right on  ?   they were perfect,? Mr. Trump said of Judge Gorton?s comments. Mr. Trump is hardly the first president to criticize or seek to apply pressure to the courts Mr. Obama admonished Supreme Court justices as they sat before him in the House chamber during his 2010 State of the Union address for their ruling in the Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission case that allowed corporations to spend freely to influence elections. John Yoo, a former counsel to Mr. Bush, argued that Mr. Trump was using a potent weapon that has been used throughout history  ?   the presidential prerogative to provoke a constitutional crisis when a vital issue is at stake  ?   on an insignificant matter. ?I hate to see a president waste that kind of authority, which should only be deployed for our most important questions, on this immigration order, which the president could easily withdraw, fix and resubmit,? said Mr. Yoo, now a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley. ?President Trump is pressing the accelerator down to 120 miles per hour on every single issue. He will exhaust himself and exhaust his presidency. ? Peter Wallison, a former White House counsel to Ronald Reagan, said the president often wished to weigh in on legal matters concerning personal friends or issues important to his administration, and Mr. Wallison always advised against it, both to protect the tradition of judicial independence and avoid undercutting the courts? legitimacy. ?It?s not illegal, it?s not a violation of the law to say these things, but it?s bad policy because it raises questions about the independence of the courts, and it raises questions about the judicial system as a whole when the president says this,? Mr. Wallison said. Mr. Reagan did not always take his advice, he added, and in those instances, ?I always cringed. ? Mr. Trump defended the process that yielded the executive order, saying he had initially wanted to wait a week or even a month before issuing the travel ban. But he said he was told by law enforcement officials that doing so would prompt a flood of people, including some with ?very evil intentions,? to rush into the United States before the restrictions took effect. That account appears to be at odds with the one given by several senior officials, who have said they were not fully briefed on the details of Mr. Trump?s order until the day the president signed it at the Pentagon. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump told the law enforcement officers that he was acting solely out of a concern about terrorism, a threat he said had deepened since he took office and gained access to information about the risks facing Americans. ?Believe me, I?ve learned a lot in the last two weeks, and terrorism is a far greater threat than the people of our country understand,? Mr. Trump said. ?But we?re going to take care of it. We?re going to win. ?"
18384,A.O. Scott,9/02/2017,2017,2,entertainment,"If you need a distraction from fighting about ?La La Land,? cheering at ?Hidden Figures? or weeping about ?Moonlight?  ?   all of which might have been distracting you from other things  ?   there are 15   movies quietly soliciting your attention, along with that of the academy voters. The   nominees are often unsung   highlights, too easily overlooked except for   balloting purposes. This is a shame, since in about the time it would take to watch ?Arrival? three times or ?Toni Erdmann? twice, you could take a remarkably   tour of world cinema. Even in a generally strong year like this one, the shorts display a cosmopolitan breadth and a stylistic variety that the other categories often lack. The animated nominees include handmade as well as digital productions, and dark, adult themes as well as   charm and whimsy. The live action and documentary candidates tackle painful   material with compassion, courage and imagination (though sometimes also with conventional sentimentality). All of the films arrive in theaters in New York on Wednesday and nationwide on Friday and will be available Feb. 21 on many streaming platforms (though several can be found on various sites now). Here is a brief critical guide. Before it was a mighty fief within Disney?s Magic Kingdom, Pixar was a plucky and resourceful   and those roots are often most visible in its nonfeature offerings. This year?s, ?Piper? (directed by Alan Barillaro and Marc Sondheimer) is a technical tour de force of feathers and foam about a fledgling seabird overcoming its fear of water with the encouragement of a firm but loving parent. (The story is a bit like ?Moana? in reverse.) The   relationship seems to be a sturdy animation theme, figuring in Andrew Coats and Lou  ?s ?Borrowed Time,? about a Western lawman dad and his Western lawman son, and Patrick Osborne?s ?Pearl? (now on YouTube) about a rock ?n? roll dad and his rock ?n? roll daughter. All three of these films show how much can be done without dialogue, and offer a respite from the usual    cartoon fare that fills up the multiplexes. ?Blind Vaysha,? a film by Theodore Ushev with folkloric, Eastern European overtones, is a bit talkier, with a narrator?s voice accompanying eerie,   images. ?Pear Cider and Cigarettes,? the longest, richest and saddest of the films, also uses   narration to tell a painful personal story about the life and death of Techno Stypes, a   childhood friend of Robert Valley, who directed the film. (It?s available on Vimeo for a fee.) If I were voting, I?d go for Techno, but if I had to make a prediction, I?d never bet against Pixar. The predicament of migrants and refugees in Europe figures in two of the nominees, ?Ennemis Int?rieurs? (?Internal Enemies?) from France, and ?Silent Nights,? from Denmark. The first, directed by S?lim Azzazi, consists mainly of a tense interview between two men, both of Arab descent, who have lived in France all their lives. The older man is a former convict applying for citizenship, the younger one a government official. Their conversation, which takes place in 1998, touches on terrorism, religion and the integrity of ?La Republique,? issues that could hardly be more relevant as France approaches a possibly fateful presidential election. ?Silent Nights? confronts similar questions as it traces the relationship between a young Danish woman and a Ghanaian immigrant, whose mutual empathy (and romantic attraction) is tested by the drastically different circumstances they face. The humanism of this film, directed by Aske Bang and Kim Magnusson, is shadowed by an inescapable pessimism, an intimation that kindness, while essential, may not be enough when survival is at stake. There is nothing overtly topical or political in the other three nominees, which are also from Europe. ?La Femme et le TGV? (?The Woman and the TGV,? available for a fee from iTunes) from Switzerland, is almost rescued from mawkish triviality by the affecting performance of the great Jane Birkin as the title character, and nearly ruined by a cloying, aggressive score. The Spanish film ?Timecode,? about the clandestine activities of parking garage security guards, might seem equally slight, but it reveals itself to be a sly fable of creative resistance in the face of deadening routine. And Kristof Deak and Anna Udvardy?s ?Sing,? my favorite in this batch, might be mistaken for a sweet story of the friendship between two Hungarian schoolgirls until the last scene, when it becomes a parable of defiance against unjust and corrupt authority. (Hey, teacher! Leave those kids alone!) Like the nominees in the   best documentary category, the five films in this group demonstrate a commitment to both relevance and experimentation. Only one of them, ?Joe?s Violin? (now on YouTube) follows the conventional,   template, alternating interviews, archival footage and   events as it tells the touching story of a Holocaust survivor who donated his violin to a public school in the Bronx. The film, directed by Kahane Cooperman, proceeds though familiar beats, but its emotions are genuine and its characters are well worth knowing. Their lives are not easy, but ?Joe?s Violin? feels downright soothing alongside its competition, which includes some of the most wrenching, unsparing images I have seen on film in the past year. The aptly named ?Extremis,? by Dan Krauss (on Netflix now) plunges the viewer into the midst of gravely ill patients and the doctors who must help their families decide whether to continue life support. The reality of death is something we often avoid, and even for half an hour, this film is difficult to watch. But it is also gripping, suspenseful and moving  ?   a hard look at a hard subject. Those words also describe the three short documentaries about the Syrian war and the European refugee crisis. Daphne Matziaraki?s ?4. 1 Miles? (produced by The New York Times?s Opinion section and available on nytimes. com) plies the waters off the Greek island of Lesbos as coast guard officers try to rescue migrants crowded onto inflatable rafts. ?The White Helmets,? by Orlando von Einsiedel and Joanna Natasegara (now on Netflix) and ?Watani: My Homeland,? by Marcel Mettelsiefen and Stephen Ellis, both take place in Aleppo, and provide a glimpse of the horror that city has endured in recent years. Too rigorous to offer false hope, they nonetheless affirm the necessity of witness and an antidote to despair. I can?t choose between them, but I hope one of them wins."
17519,Guy Trebay,13/01/2017,2017,1,entertainment,"To be fair to Casey Affleck, he is not the biggest schlump in show business. Adam Sandler takes that prize. And let?s state upfront that we are talking here strictly in sartorial terms. There is plenty to be said about the more serious of Mr. Affleck?s shortcomings, the ones that have led him to settle two sexual harassment cases out of court and that some say may cost him the Oscar. For present purposes, however, what concerns us is Mr. Affleck?s bizarro style, a kind of slovenly and idiosyncratic take on normcore that conjures up images of every high school stoner you have ever met. Lately, the star has been seen in public a lot, picking up prize statuary and barnstorming the   circuit  ?   from Jimmy Kimmel to Jimmy Fallon to ?Saturday Night Live?  ?   for ?Manchester by the Sea. ? In this immaculately calibrated Kenneth Lonergan   Mr. Affleck plays a Boston handyman descended into a fugue of volatile,   depression after a tragic series of events. Making his strongest bid yet for an Oscar, the perennially underestimated actor gives a performance so tightly coiled that it threatens at times to crash projection software in theaters and plunge audiences into the dark. Slogging his way toward the biggest award show, in February, Mr. Affleck has so far picked up Golden Globe, Gotham, National Board of Review, New York Film Critics Circle and Critics? Choice trophies. And he has become, for now, a regular presence in the press and on television, the thinking person?s Bill and Ted. ?Thanks for dressing up,? Stephen Colbert said to Mr. Affleck last February, when he appeared on ?The Late Show? to promote his previous movie, the crime thriller ?Triple 9. ? Mr. Colbert was referring to Mr. Affleck?s hardly bothering  : a pair of roomy khakis, sneakers, a rumpled blazer and an untucked   shirt. His hair, as is customary, looked as though he had combed it with salad tongs. ?I can?t tell whether this choice is the least celebrity thing to do or the most celebrity thing to do, because it?s very casual,? Mr. Colbert told the actor, whom he went on to liken, with some accuracy, to a ?  Jesus. ? Mr. Affleck, of course, is far from the first star to use clothes to register his pointed indifference to the industry?s sports jacket or penguin suit conventions. Turning up on Jon Stewart?s Comedy Central show, Mr. Sandler once wore an oversize corduroy shirt jacket he termed a ?shacket? while flogging a forgettable 2011 movie titled ?Jack and Jill. ? At the time, Mr. Sandler said his wife had purchased the shacket in a bid to upgrade his wardrobe, though to the average viewer, the garment looked like something found on a Greyound bus. When compared with Mr. Sandler, with his customary Stu Pickles   Mr. Affleck is a   Cary Grant. He appears to own a blazer and a suit or two, and can seemingly knot a tie. True, those ties tend to migrate off the centerline, his shirt collars curl at the ends, and his hairstyles skew messianic. But at least he has not been seen in public wearing sweatpants featuring the dorsal cleavage often referred to as plumber?s   ?     never mind. ?Casey always looks vaguely unshowered anyway, in real life, as well,? said Melissa Toth, whose meticulous work on ?Manchester by the Sea? is a master class in cinematic costume design. ?He?s a scruffy boy. ? The   scruff on his chin is occupational, Mr. Affleck explained in   on ?Saturday Night Live,? grown for a part. Yet the truth is, it has been some time since anyone has spotted the      actor without the chin whiskers that are the male version of the eyeglasses pretty girls sometimes wear to make themselves look smart. ?Scraggly? was the term Mr. Affleck applied to his beard on ?Saturday Night Live,? and ?not in a Santa way, more of a ?Duck Dynasty? way. ? And if scraggly is the image he has cultivated in almost every appearance, it?s a look he may decide to polish when Oscar season rolls around in full. After years spent ?banging on Hollywood?s door,? as Variety said in October, the time may have come, with ?Manchester by the Sea,? for Mr. Affleck to break through to the big leagues. And when he does  ?   as odds suggest is likely  ?   he may want to spring for a   shave and a jacket that fits, and learn to tuck in his shirt, industry experts say. ?As a sign of respect, it is better to err on the side of dressing too well than not dressing enough,? said Rob Burnett, the longtime executive producer of ?Late Show With David Letterman. ? ?You want to avoid the possibility of ever looking like you don?t care. ? What should never happen, Mr. Burnett added, is that a   host like Mr. Fallon, Mr. Colbert or Mr. Kimmel takes an appraising look at an actor dressed in clothes you might wear to clean out the attic and says, ?Oh, thanks for dressing up. ?"
17785,"Jonathan Ellis, Katie Rogers and Nick Corasaniti",20/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"?   Donald J. Trump soaked in the cheers at the opening concert as the inaugural festivities began. ? But in downtown Washington, D. C.   revelers had to share the streets with adamant   protesters. ? Never fear, though. Mr. Trump says his high I. Q. cabinet will unify the nation. The opening concert of the long inaugural    was the stuff of legend  ?   acts came, followed by protests, followed by withdrawals. Names were floated, like Elton John and Charlotte Church, only to have the artists publicly rebuke the invitation. But when it all finally came together, a beaming Mr. Trump stood at the foot of the Lincoln Memorial on Thursday night, basking in the applause from thousands of concertgoers and vowing to ?unify our country. ? ?But we?re going to make America great for all of our people,? the   told the crowd. ?That includes the inner cities, that includes everybody. ? Just hours before he was to be sworn in, Mr. Trump still recalled grievances from the campaign. ?The polls started going up, up, up, but they didn?t want to give us credit,? he said. But he also turned his attention to the future, promising to work hard and saying he was looking forward to Friday. A tableau of Trumps  ?   including the incoming first lady, Melania Trump, Mr. Trump?s grown children and their spouses, and his grandchildren  ?   then stood triumphantly at the top of the steps, framed by marble and under the gaze of the nation?s 16th president. Fireworks concluded the ?Make America Great Again? concert, which featured Toby Keith and 3 Doors Down. The next president of the United States has a way with words, so let?s just let him talk. At Washington?s Union Station on Thursday night, he greeted honored guests. To Jared Kushner, his    and adviser, he said, ?If you can?t produce peace in the Middle East, nobody can. ? To his White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, he commented, ?Nobody knew how to pronounce his name. It?s a crazy name. ? The   added, ?Reince was taking tremendous abuse because he went through hell. ? Then it was on to his   campaign, in 2020: ?The next time, four years from now, the next time we?re going to win the   way, we?re going to win because we did so well, because it was so overwhelming, the thing that we did, because it was so beautiful. ? On that last point, it was not clear how he was implying he won in 2016: Russian interference? Losing the popular tally by nearly three million votes? As for Inauguration Day, Mr. Trump saw a silver lining in the forecast rain. ?If it really pours tomorrow, that?s O. K.,? he said, ?because people will realize it?s my real hair. ? The inaugural kickoff celebration on the National Mall had been a subdued affair without protests, but at least one of the inaugural balls organized by Mr. Trump?s supporters has drawn protesters. The DeploraBall, a cocktail party organized by supporters of Mr. Trump and held at the National Press Club, drew several hundred protesters crowded into a city block, chanting and waving signs denouncing the incoming Trump administration. Sarko Sarkodie, a    Washington resident, was part of the crowd. ?I?m just part of the resistance efforts that have been happening this week,? Ms. Sarkodie said. ?And they?ll be happening over the next four years. ? Trump supporters seemed to be staying away from the event, but several people watched the scene from inside a nearby bar, where a man wearing a Trump flag and Trump sweatpants could be seen embracing friends. ?That?s a brave dude, right there,? a bystander said of the man. Several people wandered through the area in gowns, seemingly dismayed when they turned the corner to encounter the protests. But perennial presidential candidate and kid favorite Vermin Supreme made it to the show. At the Smithsonian?s National Museum of African American History and Culture, a throng of people in   ball gowns, dashikis, tuxedos and silk headscarves flocked to the   Peace Ball: Voices of Hope and Resistance. ?I guess I was just looking for something to put my energy into and to give Obama a really good ? said Pavy Bacon, a    Maryland resident, about why she bought a ticket to the ball. ?If you really appreciate what Obama has done, you can?t help but be fearful of the next administration. ? The event, which was in the works before Election Day, was not envisioned as an   affair. Anas ?Andy? Shallal, an   artist and activist who owns the popular D. C.  bookstore cafe chain Busboys and Poets, dreamed up the party as the ultimate celebration of the progress made under President Obama. But as inauguration day drew closer, Peace Ball became a place for liberals to converge and comfort themselves. John Osborne, a    lawyer from Washington, D. C. perused the   exhibits with his wife and said he came because  ?   on the eve of the inauguration  ?   he wanted to surround himself with people from all races, religions and backgrounds. ?I wanted to be in a place that reflects the America that I see and live everyday,? he said. ?I?m hopeful that our country will remain that way. ? Expected guests included the actor Danny Glover, the   artist Solange Knowles,   Grammy winning jazz musician Esperanza Spalding, the   author Alice Walker and CNN pundit Van Jones. Before the official festivities began, Mr. Trump appeared at a luncheon with supporters at the Trump International Hotel, where he praised the collective I. Q. of his cabinet members. ?We have by far the highest I. Q. of any cabinet ever assembled,? Mr. Trump said in the remarks, which reporters heard only the first several minutes of before being escorted out. Of course, he put himself into the high I. Q. category when he boasted, ?This is a gorgeous room. A total genius must have built this place. ? (As an aside, it is impossible to do the math, but President Obama?s starters did include a Nobel laureate in physics at the Energy Department, a former president of Harvard heading the National Economic Council and the president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank as Treasury secretary.) Mr. Trump also singled out specific supporters, including Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets football team, and his pick for Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin. Mr. Mnuchin, Mr. Trump noted, wasn?t at the lunch because he was being ?grilled? at his Senate confirmation hearing several blocks away. Mr. Trump also faulted senators for not being ?nice? to Representative Tom Price of Georgia, his pick to be the health and human services secretary. And speaking of Mr. Johnson, the Jets owner is expected to get one of the plum jobs in diplomacy, the United States ambassador to Britain, or as the Brits call it, ambassador of the United States to the Court of St. James?s. Mr. Johnson is only the fourth ambassador to be announced by Mr. Trump, after Nikki Haley as ambassador to the United Nations David Friedman, his longtime attorney, as ambassador to Israel and Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad as ambassador to China. Given that both Mr. Trump and his British counterpart, Prime Minister Theresa May, are relatively new in their roles, Mr. Johnson?s ability to get Mr. Trump on the phone quickly could be helpful. At   this year, the Jets weren?t the best. The   and vice   laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery. Then it was on to the Lincoln Memorial for the concert that opens the Inaugural festivities. Eric Huppert, the leader of Defenders of Liberty Motorcycle Club and local organizer of Bikers for Trump, stood beside a row of hulking   Harley Davidsons and said he was not looking for violence. Sure, Chris Cox, the founder of Bikers for Trump, had pledged that his members would act as a ?wall of meat? to block   protesters, but Mr. Huppert downplayed all that. ?I don?t anticipate any skirmishes  ?   at least I hope not,? he said. But if the safety of Mr. Trump?s supporters  ?   or even the   himself  ?   is jeopardized, he added, ?I think these folks will be willing to jump in if necessary. ? A security force beholden to no one with no rules of engagement and no real marching orders is, well, not a great idea. But Bikers for Trump stand by their man. David Nichols traveled from Texarkana, Tex. with seven others to attend the Bikers for Trump rally on Inauguration Day. The group drove for 22 hours straight, towing eight bikes on a   trailer. ?He?ll be a fine president  ?   he just has to calm down his words,? Mr. Nichols said. ?Just don?t bash people?s name too much. ? A day before Mr. Trump is to be sworn in as the 45th president of the United States, he took to Twitter to assert that he is not responsible for the nation?s divisions. His champion? The Rev. Franklin Graham. To some, Mr. Graham?s good wishes may not hold much weight. Last month on Facebook, he decried House Speaker Paul D. Ryan?s failure to join him and the   in ending all Muslim immigration ?until we can properly vet them or until the war with Islam is over. ? He castigated Representative William Lacy Clay, Democrat of Missouri, for defending a high school student?s artwork depicting a confrontation between citizens and police, depicted as pigs. And last year, Mr. Graham said of gays, ?you cannot stay gay and continue to call yourself a Christian. ?"
17822,Richard P?rez-Pe?a,20/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"The legal record shows that Jerry Hartfield?s first murder conviction was thrown out on appeal, and for the next 32 years, he was not officially guilty of anything, not sentenced to anything. Yet he spent that time in Texas prisons, in what an appellate court now calls ?a criminal justice nightmare. ? He was finally tried and convicted again in 2015, but on Thursday, Mr. Hartfield moved closer to freedom than he has been in decades. A state Court of Appeals ruled that he was not only denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial, but to a degree the court had neither seen nor imagined before it noted that the important precedents dealt with delays of three years, six years, eight years  ?   not 32. The   panel dismissed the indictment against Mr. Hartfield, who is developmentally disabled, in effect erasing the recent conviction. But it is still not clear whether, or when, he will get out of prison. Prosecutors could appeal Thursday?s ruling to the Court of Criminal Appeals, Texas? highest criminal tribunal. The state Attorney General?s Office, which has argued against Mr. Hartfield, referred questions to the Matagorda County District Attorney?s Office, which did not reply to requests for comment. ?We are deeply mindful that our conclusion today means that a defendant who may be guilty of murder may go free,? Judge Gina M. Benavides wrote for the Court of Appeals. ?However, based on the United States Constitution, it is the only possible remedy. ? All told, Mr. Hartfield, now 60, has spent more than 40 years behind bars for the murder of a bus station ticket clerk. His case can seem like something out of absurdist fiction: a court ruling ignored or forgotten, an appeal dismissed by a court that agreed with the substance but said it had been filed under the wrong statute, a retrial after most of the evidence had been lost and witnesses had died, and an argument by prosecutors that Mr. Hartfield, himself, was to blame for the delays, and caused them intentionally. ?Once you call this Kafkaesque, you can?t really call anything else Kafkaesque, because there?s nothing else remotely like this,? said David R. Dow of the University of Houston Law Center, one of the lawyers who represented Mr. Hartfield on appeal. ?This was the perfect storm of everything that could go wrong with the criminal justice system. ? On Sept. 17, 1976, Eunice Lowe, a    white woman, was killed where she worked, the Continental Trailways station in Bay City, southwest of Houston. The killer bashed in her head with a pickax, stole money from the station and took her car, and there was evidence of sexual assault after death. Mr. Hartfield, a black man, signed a confession that he later disavowed, and, crucially, investigators said he told them where to find Ms. Lowe?s car. Experts placed his I. Q. in the 50s or 60s, which his lawyers contend made him easily coerced by detectives, and unable to understand his rights or his confession. A jury convicted him and he was sentenced to death. But the Court of Criminal Appeals later overturned that verdict, ruling that a potential juror had been improperly dismissed for having doubts about the death penalty, and ordered a new trial. After years of legal wrangling, the high court ruling took effect in March 1983. Under Texas law at the time, prosecutors had a way to avoid a retrial and preserve the conviction  ?   but only if they acted within a time frame set by the court. Because the trial error had to do with capital punishment, if the governor commuted the sentence to life in prison, then it would be as if the appellate court had never ruled, and the guilty verdict would remain in effect. That was apparently never communicated to the prison system. Mr. Dow said that Mr. Hartfield thought he was awaiting a new trial, but did not have the capacity to understand the delay or what to do about it. Whether the District Attorney?s Office understood what had happened at the time is unclear, but it never took steps to retry him, and the case lay dormant for the next 23 years. Prosecutors have argued that Mr. Hartfield had legal representation all along, because his original defense team remained his lawyers of record until a court formally dismissed them in 2013. But Mr. Hartfield?s new lawyers say he had no legal counsel from 1983, when the original team thought they were done with the case, until a federal court appointed a lawyer in 2008. Starting in 2006, a fellow inmate helped Mr. Hartfield file motions in various courts. Some were rejected outright, and at least one apparently went to the wrong office. One federal judge ruled in his favor, but another said he had to keep trying in state court. Finally, in 2013, Texas? Court of Criminal Appeals ruled that Mr. Hartfield?s conviction and life sentence were void, but his motions were also void. The motions were filed under a law applying to people who have been convicted, the court said, and there was no valid conviction on record in his case. He refiled under a different provision, and prosecutors finally sought a new trial. Mr. Hartfield?s lawyers said the charges should be dismissed because he was denied a speedy trial. Prosecutors argued that while the government was negligent, the defendant was partly to blame for the delays. For more than two decades, they said, he acquiesced in his imprisonment without trial, as a ploy to avoid the death penalty and to make it harder to mount a case against him. (The Supreme Court ruled in 2002 that intellectually disabled people cannot be executed.) The District Attorney?s Office was able to locate just one of the 16 evidence exhibits used at the original trial, several witnesses had died, and at least one had dementia. The murder weapon was lost, along with blood and semen samples that could have yielded DNA. Ms. Lowe?s car no longer existed. But the trial court ruled that the case could proceed, and in 2015, 38 years after his first trial, Mr. Hartfield was convicted again and sentenced to life in prison. If that sentence were counted from the start of his time in prison, he would have been eligible for parole long ago. If he is released based on Thursday?s ruling, he would probably live with one of his two sisters, Mr. Dow said. ?I?m not sure if he knows about this ruling yet,? Mr. Dow said. ?I think it?s unlikely he really understands it very well. ?"
17630,Jack Ewing,14/01/2017,2017,1,business,"The hunt for the people behind Volkswagen?s emissions scandal did not end with the company?s plea bargain this week. There was the man identified in court documents only as ?Supervisor B,? who overruled nervous subordinates and told them to develop the illegal software. Don?t get caught, he told them, according to the documents. There was ?Attorney A,? who, as regulators closed in, urged   to destroy any emails that mentioned the ?acoustic function,? the code name for emissions cheating software. The two suspects were conspicuously missing from the group of six Volkswagen executives indicted on Wednesday  ?   a clear indication that there could be more criminal charges, further eroding the company?s reputation and destabilizing management. There is little doubt that investigators will lean on suspects to testify against others, and push as high up in Volkswagen?s organization chart as the evidence allows. The $20 billion that Volkswagen is paying to resolve  civil and criminal charges  ?   including obstruction of justice and conspiracy to defraud the United States government  ?   is unlikely to be the end of the story. Even as the settlement removed a major source of uncertainty for the company, other cases loom. Shareholder lawsuits in the United States and Europe could cost an additional $10 billion. United States authorities also signaled that investigators will not be constrained by national boundaries. Five of the six people indicted on Wednesday are believed to be in Germany. The cost of the United States settlements drains cash that Volkswagen urgently needs to adapt to technological upheaval.   cars,   services and other innovations are expected to upend the industry. The settlement ?is an important step that will help Volkswagen to win back trust in the United States,? said Ferdinand Dudenh?ffer, a professor at the University of  . But the cost, he said, ?will set back Volkswagen?s plans and in my opinion require cuts in investment in the United States. ? Volkswagen clearly hoped the settlement would be the turning point that allows it to begin rebuilding its shattered reputation. The company issued publicity photographs this week of a shiny replacement for the blue and white ?VW? logo that for decades has stood like a giant hood ornament atop Volkswagen?s   executive offices in its hometown, Wolfsburg. ?Volkswagen deeply regrets the behavior that gave rise to the diesel crisis,? Matthias Mller, its chief executive, said in a statement. ?Since all of this came to light, we have worked tirelessly to make things right for our affected customers. ? But the settlement  ?   and the admissions made by the company in the deal  ?   leave Volkswagen vulnerable in other ways. As part of an agreement that calls for Volkswagen to pay $4. 3 billion in penalties and plead guilty to violations of the Clean Air Act, the company signed off on a detailed account of how the cheating software came into being, and how Volkswagen employees tried to cover it up after regulators? suspicions were aroused. The document portrays a broad conspiracy that included engine developers, software experts, quality control managers,   lawyers and people responsible for emissions compliance. The account of the wrongdoing reinforces the view that Volkswagen corporate culture was seriously awry. Employees who raised objections to the wrongdoing were overruled by those higher up. In 2012, for example, senior executives rebuffed a group of Volkswagen engineers who had discovered the illegal software. The engineers were told to destroy documents they had prepared showing how the software worked, according to a federal indictment unsealed this week. Instead of coming clean after regulators began asking questions in 2014, Volkswagen executives mounted a    . Ahead of a meeting with California regulators in August 2015, according to the plea agreement, Volkswagen officials even drew up a script for what they would say to conceal the illegal software and win approval for new models to go on sale. Such evidence could be used to bolster other cases. Shareholders in the United States and Europe have filed lawsuits saying Volkswagen had a duty to warn much sooner of the potential financial havoc that would be caused by the official investigations. Company shares plunged after the scandal came to light and have not fully recovered. Further charges could also wreak havoc on the upper ranks. The document does not directly implicate members of the Volkswagen management board, but it does not exonerate them either. Several of the people indicted reported directly to Martin Winterkorn, the Volkswagen chief executive until he resigned in the wake of the scandal. There was some good news for Volkswagen. The maximum penalty just for the criminal violations would have been $34 billion, according to Department of Justice calculations. Volkswagen received a discount for being cooperative after its initial stonewalling, and for the nearly $16 billion it is paying to owners of Volkswagen diesels, dealers and others as compensation. The deal was the product of weeks of   negotiations by representatives for the government and Volkswagen, all of whom were eager to resolve the case before   Donald J. Trump takes office. Volkswagen sales have been holding up even though the company?s reputation has taken a beating. Volkswagen said this week that it sold 10. 3 million vehicles worldwide in 2016, a 4 percent increase over 2015. But Volkswagen?s market share in Europe, which accounts for about a third of sales, slipped during the year to 24 percent from 25 percent. And the company continues to struggle in the United States. Sales of Volkswagen brand cars fell 8 percent last year to 323, 000 vehicles, though there were signs of a rebound toward the end of the year. It will be difficult for anyone associated with the scandal to rest easy. The specter of further indictments and arrests, along with the bad publicity they generate, is likely to weigh on company morale, if not its financial prospects. Top managers are not immune. German prosecutors have said they consider Hans Dieter P?tsch, chairman of the Volkswagen supervisory board, a suspect in a related investigation into possible violations of securities laws. Volkswagen said in a statement that its management board ?duly fulfilled its disclosure obligation under German capital markets law. ? Mr. P?tsch was a member of the management board before becoming chairman of the supervisory board, an oversight panel, in October 2015. Germany does not usually extradite its own citizens. But any employees indicted by United States authorities risk arrest if they travel outside Germany, even to other European countries. Unusually, only one member of the Volkswagen management board attended the North American International Auto Show, a major industry event that is underway in Detroit. Herbert Diess, head of the unit that produces Volkswagen brand cars, who joined the company shortly before the scandal came to light, was the highest ranking company executive in Detroit. Volkswagen said in a statement that the smaller presence was the result of ?a critical assessment of the efficiency and effectiveness? of its car show activities. Volkswagen had hoped to use the Detroit auto show to reconnect with American consumers. It showed off the Atlas, a sport utility vehicle with three rows of seats that will be made at Volkswagen?s plant in Chattanooga, Tenn. and fill a gap in the company?s lineup. Mr. Diess tried to sound upbeat. ?We want to reignite America?s love for Volkswagen,? he said."
17973,Nate Cohn,27/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"There isn?t any evidence to support President Trump?s assertion that three to five million illegal votes were cast in the 2016 presidential election. But there is one study that has been interpreted to suggest it is at least possible. It found that between 32, 000 and 2. 8 million noncitizen voters might have fraudulently cast ballots in the 2008 presidential election. The study, based on a survey of 38, 000 people after that election, has been under fire since it was published in 2014. Now even its authors concede that it probably overstated the amount of noncitizen voting. ?The   estimates are likely incorrect,? Jesse Richman, one of the   of the study and a political science professor at Old Dominion University, said in an email exchange on Wednesday. In a post online, he also said that the findings do not support Mr. Trump?s contention that millions cast ballots illegally. Mr. Richman still maintains that some small percentage of noncitizens vote in American elections. But the debate over this study has moved on. It?s no longer about whether millions of illegal votes were cast, but whether there?s any evidence for noncitizen voting at all. The study?s bold claims fell apart because of something called response error: the possibility that people taking a survey don?t answer a question correctly  ?   in this case, a question about being American citizens. There is always a tiny amount of response error in surveys. Respondents might not understand the question. Or they might understand it, but mark the wrong answer by mistake, if the survey is  . An interviewer, if there is one, could accidentally record the wrong answer. Such errors usually aren?t a problem large enough to change the results of a survey. But both the survey and the question posed by researchers were unusual. The survey  ?   the Cooperative Congressional Election Study  ?   was huge, with 38, 000 respondents in 2008. And the group in question  ?   noncitizens  ?   was very small, just 339 of those respondents. The problem is that even a tiny amount of response error among the 38, 000 respondents could have been enough to contaminate the results of the tiny group of noncitizens. Imagine, for instance, that 99. 9 percent of people respond to the survey?s citizenship question correctly. In such a big survey, even that high success rate would still imply that there were 38 respondents who answered incorrectly  ?   enough to make up a big chunk of the tiny pool of 339 noncitizen respondents. If those 38 misreported noncitizens had indeed voted, then suddenly it would look as if 10 percent of noncitizens voted. This critique could explain all of the noncitizen voting observed in the study. Critics of the study  ?   Stephen Ansolabehere, a Harvard political scientist, Samantha Luks, a statistician at YouGov, and Brian  Schaffner, a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst  ?   were able to marshal evidence strongly consistent with that possibility, because of the survey?s unusual design: Thousands of voters are   in subsequent elections. That allowed the study?s critics to check whether people were consistent about their answer on the citizenship answer from year to year. If the people were consistent, they were probably noncitizens. If voters were inconsistent, it would be a sign that the category was contaminated by the tiny number of voters who misreported their citizenship. There was not much consistency. Between 2010 and 2012, 20 voters switched from being citizens to noncitizens (an extremely unlikely transition) and 36 others switched from noncitizens to citizens (a more common transition, but one reported at a far greater rate than typically occurs). These shifting answers strongly bolster the theory that many of the respondents logged as noncitizens had responded in error. But most important, among the 85 respondents who said they were noncitizens in both 2010 and 2012  ?   those most likely to really be noncitizens  ?   none had voted in the 2010 midterm elections. The critics concluded that ?the likely percent of noncitizen voters in recent U. S. elections is 0. ? In a response published in October, Mr. Richman and his colleagues did not contest the finding that measurement error probably exaggerated the number of noncitizen voters. ?The response error issues they focus on may have biased our numbers,? Mr. Richman said in an email to The New York Times on Wednesday. Mr. Richman and his colleagues have not estimated a new range of possible noncitizen voting. Instead, the October response sought only to rebut the notion that there was no noncitizen voting. They argued that measurement error couldn?t explain all of the people who said they were noncitizens and voted. When it came to hard evidence immune to the measurement error critique, Mr. Richman and his   found one validated 2012 voter who had indicated not being a citizen in both the 2010 and 2012 surveys. But the same noncitizen had indicated in the survey that he or she was not registered to vote. The determination that he or she was a voter was based on voter records: The respondents to the survey were matched to a voter registration file. It is possible that this noncitizen was erroneously matched to the voter file. The matching process is good but imperfect, and becomes harder with less information  ?   like the absence of a specific address or date of birth. That the respondent said he or she wasn?t registered certainly raises the possibility that the match was wrong. ?I haven?t seen any evidence that I would say shows that any noncitizens vote,? Mr. Schaffner said. ?That doesn?t mean that the rate is exactly zero. But it does mean that it?s   frequency that we can?t even measure it with traditional methods. ?"
17724,Emmarie Huetteman,18/01/2017,2017,1,business,"WASHINGTON  ?   Representative Ryan Zinke, Republican of Montana, pitched himself on Tuesday as a serious steward of federal resources in his confirmation hearing for interior secretary, frequently bucking conservative orthodoxy on ownership of public lands, federal funding for preservation and even, briefly, climate change. But Mr. Zinke also emphasized his support for drilling, mining and logging on federal lands, activities strongly opposed by many environmental groups. In   testimony before a Senate panel that lasted nearly four hours, Mr. Zinke, a former member of the Navy SEALs who just finished his first term in the House, tried to balance the importance of preservation with use of the nation?s public lands and waters. He expressed admiration for Gifford Pinchot, the first United States Forest Service chief, who advocated planned use and renewal. Mr. Zinke also said he supported energy development on federal lands. Recreational activities and mining, for instance, are not mutually exclusive, he said. ?It doesn?t have to be in conflict,? he said. Mr. Zinke broke with   Donald J. Trump and even his own past statements on climate change, disagreeing with Mr. Trump?s assertion at one point that it is ?a hoax. ? Having once said that climate change was ?not proven science,? Mr. Zinke said it was ?indisputable? that the climate is changing and that humans are having an effect on it. ?I think where there?s debate is what that influence is, what we can do about it,? Mr. Zinke said. ?I don?t believe it?s a hoax,? he added. He later appeared to try to temper his statement, emphasizing the need for ?objective science. ? Democrats pressed Mr. Zinke, who grew up near Glacier National Park in Montana, about whether he would shield federal lands from being sold, one of their primary concerns. ?With a new administration, are these public lands going to face an unbelievable attack by those who would like to take these public lands away from us and turn them over back to states?? asked Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington, the panel?s top Democrat. ?Or are we going to continue to manage these resources for the incredible investment that they are and continue to improve them, so we get even more economic return?? Mr. Zinke was unequivocal: ?I am absolutely against transfer and sale of public lands. I can?t be more clear. ? Asked about his vote on a House rule that would make it easier for the government to cede control of federal lands, he acknowledged that he would not vote for it again. ?That?s a great answer,? said Senator Martin Heinrich, Democrat of New Mexico. Mr. Zinke said one of his priorities as interior secretary would be to address an estimated $12. 5 billion backlog of maintenance and repairs in the national parks system. He also stated his support for fully funding the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which takes money from offshore oil and gas leasing to protect federal natural resources. In one of his few references to the   Mr. Zinke said Mr. Trump supported moving toward energy independence. He described his own approach as ?all of the above,? explicitly mentioning solar and wind power, as well as fossil fuels. Republicans expressed their own concerns  ?   about the need for a break from what they saw as an era of   under the Obama administration. In her opening statement, Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, the panel?s chairwoman, called her state ?the poster child? among the many that suffered under the current Department of the Interior. ?For eight years, it seemed that this administration has taken the approach that Alaska has to be protected from Alaskans,? she said, ?and they acted accordingly. ? Senators praised Mr. Zinke?s   career in the Navy SEALs as an asset, with Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, calling him a ?well equipped? candidate. But Mr. Zinke?s time in the military was not without controversy. While serving as a midlevel SEAL Team 6 officer in the 1990s, Mr. Zinke improperly sought government reimbursement for travel to his home, a decision that resulted in some of his superiors? questioning his judgment and apparently prevented him from being entrusted with a senior post, a New York Times investigation showed. His military background was referenced in a testy exchange with Senator Tammy Duckworth, Democrat of Illinois and a fellow veteran. She pointed to the fact that Mr. Zinke embraced Mr. Trump?s defense of his 2005 statements about sexually assaulting women, caught on a hot mike, as ?  talk? and questioned whether he was equipped to handle the problem of sexual harassment and assault, also a problem in the military, in the agency he seeks to lead. Mr. Zinke, who served with Ms. Duckworth in the House until recently, said he would have a ?zero tolerance? approach to sexual harassment, which he said was ?killing morale? at the agency."
17572,Liz Alderman,12/01/2017,2017,1,business,"First it was the icy snow. Now comes the freezing rain. An arctic blast that has reached as far south as the Mediterranean is generating perilous conditions for thousands of refugees in overcrowded migrant camps in Greece and prompting the European Union to declare the situation ?untenable. ? On Wednesday, a Greek navy ship docked at Lesbos island to take on as many as 500 refugees. They have been struggling to survive the subzero temperatures in the severely overcrowded main camp in Moria, using pup tents that were supposed to be temporary when they were set up last year in warmer weather. Video and photos taken by migrants inside the camp and posted to social media showed flimsy shelters sagging under a blanket of snow, and people waiting in long lines in the falling snow for food and to use bathrooms. In one video, a man identifying himself as a migrant shows people lifting the flaps of   tents near a slushy pathway. ?Look at how human beings are living,? said the man, speaking French. Imploring officials of the European Union to look at the situation themselves, he said: ?Why can?t people leave here? How is it possible to live in these conditions, my God?? On Tuesday night, the snow turned to freezing rain, forming rivers of muck around the camp and drenching tents and clothing, aid organizations reported. On Samos, another island where the main migrant camp is overflowing, refugees reported freezing conditions with no heat. At refugee camps on the Greek mainland, and especially near the northern border, migrants continued to grapple with living outside under heavy snowfall. ?This is unbearable,? said Roland Schoenbauer, a spokesman for the United Nations high commissioner for refugees, who said he was receiving reports from doctors in camps across Greece warning of rising health risks from the cold and humidity. ?It shows what happens when you try to squeeze too many people into these camps. You can?t stockpile human beings. ? A year after the European Union sealed its borders to large numbers of newcomers, Greece remains Europe?s holding pen for nearly 60, 000 men, women and children. Many have been living for months in a distressing limbo in sordid refugee camps on the mainland and on Greek islands near Turkey, unable to move to countries where they hoped to seek asylum, and with no means or motivation to return to Syria, Iraq or other countries from which they fled war or economic hardship. Eric Kempson, a British citizen who has been living on Lesbos for over a decade, has been documenting the deteriorating conditions in the Moria refugee camp, posting videos of tents collapsing under the weight of snow and migrants slogging through muddy walkways. ?It is now heavy rain and melting snow, which is causing flooding in the camp,? Mr. Kempson wrote to The New York Times, via Facebook, describing the conditions in the camp on Wednesday. ?It?s like we begin the vicious circle again and nothing gets better, only worse. ? On Monday, the European Commission issued a statement saying the Greek refugee situation was the responsibility of Greek authorities. ?The situation has become untenable,? a spokeswoman, Natasha Bertaud, said in Brussels. The United Nations refugee agency and other aid groups have been working to move migrants from camps into better shelters, including hotels. In some cases, however, they have met resistance: Hotel owners on Samos, for example, were generally refusing to house migrants, Mr. Schoenbauer said. But a bigger problem is the extremely slow processing of asylum applications for those in the Greek camps. While the numbers of people streaming across the Aegean Sea from Turkey have slowed to a trickle after Turkey and the European Union signed a deal to resolve the crisis last March, thousands of migrants have yet to be registered for asylum. That is partly because the European Union has sent just a fraction of the assistance it pledged to Greece last year to help clear the backlog. A separate European Union plan to ease Greece?s burden by relocating tens of thousands of asylum seekers has also failed to take off, with European countries taking only a few thousand of the many stuck in Greece. The bottlenecks have overwhelmed many of the camps, especially on the Greek islands, where migrants arriving after the March deal are supposed to be held until being deported to Turkey. The camp at Moria, for instance, run by the Greek police and nongovernmental organizations and designed for about 3, 000 people, was reinforced with small container shelters that can each house up to 30 people. But hundreds of makeshift tents have been set up outside for months to accommodate an overflow of asylum seekers  ?   first under the beating Greek sun, and now under the pelting snow and rain. ?The snow is only the tip of the iceberg,? Mr. Schoenbauer said. ?The bigger problem is the overcrowding of the islands, and one reason for the overcrowding is the fact that the asylum procedure remains far too slow. ?"
17301,Geeta Anand,2/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"MUMBAI, India  ?   It was a bold and risky gamble by Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India that quickly seemed to backfire. The announcement of a ban on the largest currency bills circulating in India, which came into full effect at midnight Friday, the last day for depositing the old notes at banks, set off cash shortages that have hit the country?s most vulnerable people hard and prompted worries about the economy. But despite those concerns, as well as doubts about whether the currency ban will reduce corruption as it is designed to do, for the moment, at least, Mr. Modi?s bet appears to be paying off in the public arena. Even as the poorest Indians have struggled, many have continued to voice support for the prime minister?s initiative to target the vast amounts of untaxed money, known as ?black money,? flowing through the country?s economy, in hopes that it will combat an endemic culture of corruption. Mr. Modi, analysts say, has successfully tapped into deep frustration with the corruption that pervades almost every public interface with government. ?Even though the cash ban has produced enormous hardship for me and my family, I support what Mr. Modi is doing for our country,? said Hem Raj Chechi, 39, a taxi driver in New Delhi, the capital, who said business had been down 50 percent since the ban was announced. Mr. Chechi has not been able to pay his children?s school fees or send money back to his village to support them for nearly two months. But, he said, ?We need to fight black money, even though it is hurting little people like me. ? Mr. Modi came to power as a disruptive force pledging to overturn the status quo in New Delhi, bring jobs and fight corruption. Indians have repeatedly taken to the streets in recent years to demand an end to corruption, widely seen as being most detrimental to the poor and powerless. Declaring war on corruption, Mr. Modi announced on Nov. 8 that 500 and 1, 000 rupee bills, worth about $8 and $15, would be banned the next morning. With the currency ban, Mr. Modi has managed to convince many disaffected Indians that he is on their side. He has also used his powerful skills as a communicator to persuade people like Mr. Chechi that the pain stemming from the ban is for the   good. That frustration with a political and business elite viewed by many as corrupt is what drove many Americans to vote for   Donald J. Trump last year, said Eswar S. Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell University who is a native of India. ?Trump made the case that only he could effect change by blowing up the system,? Mr. Prasad said in an interview. ?Modi, in the same way, did have a persuasive narrative that small changes at the margins can?t tackle   problems like corruption. We needed big and painful changes, really disruptive ones. ? Mr. Modi appeared on television on New Year?s Eve to tell Indians he understood their pain and urge them to bear with him in the aim of creating a better nation. He compared his cash ban to the freedom struggle led by Mohandas K. Gandhi, a battle of good versus evil. ?Today Mahatma Gandhi is not among us, but the path that was truth that he showed us is still most appropriate,? Mr. Modi said, using the honorific for Gandhi. ?As we begin the centenary year of the Satyagraha,? he said, referring to Gandhi?s nonviolent resistance movement, ?let us recall the Mahatma and resolve to follow his message of truth and goodness. ? Mr. Modi was presiding over one of the   major economies in the world when he announced the ban on the rupee notes, which made up 86 percent of the money in circulation. ?It?s a little bit crazy,? said Geng Xiao, a professor of finance and public policy at the University of Hong Kong. ?When I first read the news, I couldn?t even figure out if it was true. ? The government said that people depositing large amounts of old currency  ?   more than 250, 000 rupees, or about $3, 670, could be asked to prove that they had paid taxes on it. Some saw vast amounts of untaxed holdings suddenly rendered worthless. Whether Mr. Modi?s   move will actually reduce corruption is a matter of debate. Some economists believe it could pave the way for other measures intended to discourage bribery or restructure the economy. But others say the currency ban is unlikely to result in a significant reduction in corruption, even as it has inconvenienced hundreds of millions of people who have struggled to get enough cash to meet their daily needs while the government tries to print enough new notes to replace the banned ones. And a country short of cash has been unable to spend it, which is likely to reduce economic growth in the short term, economists say. People living on the edge of poverty have been hit hard, their diets and livelihoods severely affected. Many in India see Mr. Modi, who has also had success persuading Parliament to clear the way for a unified    tax to make it easier to ship and sell things across state lines, as living up to his promise to be a reformer of India?s ossified and bureaucratic economy. But in the process, he has placed the Indian economy and his political future at risk. Many economists believe that the Indian economy will take at least a   hit because of a dire shortage of cash, and that the future impact is uncertain. If the effects are prolonged, the public support for Modi could wane. ?If this move damages the economy, he?s in for a rough ride,? said Harsh Pant, the head of strategic studies at the Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi think tank. Mr. Xiao said that in a system in which the informal sector is substantial, the economy could be expected to experience a shock when so much cash is suddenly taken out. ?You need offsetting stimulus policies to keep the economy growing,? he said. Mr. Modi was elected by an overwhelming majority in 2014, defeating the government, led by the Indian National Congress party, that had ruled for most of the country?s   life, on the promise of bringing development and jobs and reducing corruption. ?In 2014, he had presented himself as the big disrupter,? Mr. Pant said. ?He was the precursor to what?s happening in the West. ? Mr. Modi was then the chief minister of the state of Gujarat, where he had a reputation for tearing away the country?s red tape so businesses could set up shop and expand. But during his first two years after winning national election, Mr. Modi, whose party did not control the upper house of Parliament, struggled to achieve a significant economic overhaul. Mr. Modi changed the political narrative in 2016 as he successfully fought to get Parliament to clear the way for the simplified    tax. He cast the opposition as ?people who don?t want change, who don?t want reform,? Mr. Pant said, forcing them in August to support the changes. But the challenges facing Mr. Modi remain considerable. Seven weeks after the cash ban began to be put in place, the currency shortage remains acute, leading to a sharp drop in demand for services and earnings, many providers said. Nagender Tiwari, 42, a rickshaw driver in East Delhi, said he was earning only 60 percent of the 1, 000 rupees, or about $15, that he used to take home daily before the cash ban. As a result, his family, which includes two children in 11th grade, has reduced its consumption of fish and meat. They have been unable to pay the rent on their home, he said. He said he was skeptical about whether the ban was reducing corruption, noting that he continued to be stopped by traffic police officers who extorted bribes. ?So if bribery is not stopped, how can black money be stopped?? he asked. Raj Kumar Bindal, 65, a paper trader in New Delhi, said sales that plummeted to nearly nothing in the days after the cash ban had returned to about half of what they were before. ?We can?t shift to a cashless mode overnight,? he said. Surjit Bhalla, a New   economic adviser for the Observatory Group in New York, said he believed Mr. Modi was likely to enact several other major changes in the coming months, possibly including a move to a simplified personal income tax. India needs to reduce the incentives for taxpayers to cheat, Mr. Bhalla said. In the United States, for every $100 collected in income tax, an estimated $20 owed is not paid, he added. In India, for that same $100 in taxes paid, $200 more is owed, he said. Collectively, the cash ban and other anticorruption initiatives have the potential to transform India, Mr. Pant and others said. But doing so depends on Mr. Modi?s continuing to command the political narrative of the country, as he has so successfully done since instituting the cash ban. ?So far, he has taken control of the narrative and the people are with him,? Mr. Pant said. ?He thinks he can continue to do it, but we really don?t know. There are so many unknowns. ?"
17429,Liz Spayd with Evan Gershkovich,6/01/2017,2017,1,entertainment,"We hope you got some rest over the holidays, but it?s clear from our mailbox that you remained sharp and attentive readers. We will address a few of those complaints first, before turning to this week?s topics. A   Social Q?s column, which administers lighthearted advice about awkward social situations, addressed what an adult should do when one child taunts another at a holiday party. The specific taunt in question, which was directed toward a Latina girl, was this: ?Pack your bags. Trump is going to send you back to Mexico. ? The headline on the column? ?Should I Stay Silent During One Child?s Populist Taunt of Another?? Readers took issue with the description of the taunt. The author of the column, Philip Galanes, took the time to reply to a reader who wrote to him directly. Shortly before the new year, an ad ran on a Times story that left some readers befuddled. The ad was indeed a hoax, and readers who realized this have asked The Times to address the issue. Indeed, such ads do seem to find their way onto the Times website occassionally, as a public editor column explained in November, but we asked Sebastian Tomich, senior vice president for advertising and innovation, to comment once more. Here?s his response: An hour into the new year, tragedy struck in Turkey when a gunman attacked an Istanbul nightclub. The lead byline on The Times?s story was anonymous  ?   ?an Employee of The New York Times?  ?   and readers had theories as to why. The public editor?s take: We?ve received several letters asking about the unusual byline. The international editor, Michael Slackman, said he?s not in position to comment but I suspect you are hinting at the right issues in your letter. From my experience, it is not uncommon to use a generic byline when the security of journalists may be at risk, or when a widespread team of editors and reporters is assembling a deadline story. But I?m only speaking for myself, not the paper. Just last week, a Wall Street Journal reporter was detained by Turkish officials for three days and held in isolation. The same story caught readers? attentions for other reasons, too. Initially, the story reported that the single gunman may have been as many as three gunmen, and they were wearing Santa Claus suits, an image which stayed with readers. The Times, however, never appended a correction to the story nor added a note explaining the change. We asked Slackman about this. Here?s his response: The public editor?s take: Time for me to make my plug again for attaching notes to stories that undergo a notable change from a previous edition. This wasn?t just a routine change in a rapidly unfolding story. It was a rather dramatic visual  ?   a team of men in Santa Claus suits firing into the crowd. If that turned into one man dressed like the crowd, as later stories suggest, isn?t it more transparent just to flag that? Another reader raised an issue that will hopefully be addressed in the new year. We asked Alexandra MacCallum, who oversees Times video, for an answer. She told us that while some videos have text overlay, which editors add manually, an automated closed caption system is in the works this year. As trust in the media falters, a reader has taken a stand, one friend at a time. He wrote us to ask for our aid in his mission. We, of course, pointed him to their location on the web, and if you have any upcoming debates, too, you can find The Times?s standards and ethics here. Good luck, and see you next week."
17678,Michelle Higgins,10/01/2017,2017,1,lifestyle,"Collin Bond had no intention of buying a $1, 400 Thermador warming drawer when he and his wife, Ashley, popped into the Habitat for Humanity ReStore in New Rochelle, N. Y. in the spring of 2015. But when he spotted one at the nonprofit   store for the   price of $50, he immediately scooped it up. No matter that the couple were living in a rental in Downtown Brooklyn and had only just begun their search for a Westchester County   in earnest. ?I didn?t have a place to put it at the time, but I took it,? said Mr. Bond, 36, an associate broker at Douglas Elliman in Manhattan, who had an idea of how expensive the drawer normally was from his work in the industry. ?Fifty dollars, that?s crazy!? he said, recalling his thoughts at the time. ?I wonder what else I can do?? Ms. Bond, 31, who works in public relations for the home and design industry, approved. ?I honestly didn?t see the need for a warming drawer, but liked the way he was thinking. ? And so, with his wife?s blessing and a warming drawer in the trunk of his car, Mr. Bond began his quest for a   kitchen on the cheap. It wasn?t long before he spotted a Wolf microwave, normally at least $1, 000, for $200 on Craigslist and found himself at the warehouse of the seller, a contractor in New Jersey who works on luxury developments. In chatting with the contractor, Mr. Bond learned that many of the   developers he worked with would replace all the appliances in model apartments with new ones once the apartments had sold  ?   even though the ?old? ones may have been used just to boil tea or store bottled water for visitors to the building. ?He was basically telling me, ?I?m paying an assistant to list these,?? Mr. Bond said. ?I told him, ?Just give me a call next time. ?? About a month later, Mr. Bond?s phone rang and he was back in New Jersey with a rented   and a hand truck, picking up an $7, 400   wine refrigerator for $1, 000 from the same man. Mr. Bond paid some members of the contractor?s construction crew $20 each to help him load it. With his collection of discount kitchen appliances growing, Mr. Bond invested in a small storage unit, paying around $150 a month. Now his search became strategic. To match his newly acquired wine refrigerator, a    integrated model, Mr. Bond created alerts on Craigslist for a corresponding       with the same width, depth and height, normally $7, 540. Soon, he had a Craigslist ad in his inbox posted by a contractor who was renovating a house in Westchester for clients who wanted a change in style. ?It was a relatively new kitchen,? Mr. Bond said. But according to the contractor, he added, ?The people who had bought it were like, ?We don?t like this kitchen we just want a new kitchen. ?? Mr. Bond showed up with cash in hand,   in tow. ?I went in there for one fridge and ended up negotiating and getting two fridges and the dishwasher,? he said. He paid $2, 400 for the lot, down from about $3, 000. To ensure that the appliances worked, he asked the sellers to have them up and running before he arrived. ?I?d make sure I?d call them and say, ?I?m going to meet you at 2 p. m. on Wednesday. Can you please make sure it?s plugged in and at temperature when I get there? ?? Not everything went flawlessly. After being transported to the storage unit, the wine refrigerator wouldn?t hold the proper temperature in one of its zones. ?Something had become disconnected,? said Mr. Bond, who paid a local repairman $200 to fix it. But with   refrigerators normally selling for as much as $8, 000, he figured, ?If I?m buying it for $1, 000 and I put another $1, 500 into it  ?   that?s still an incredible savings. ? But there was still the matter of finding a new home to house all the fancy appliances. ?We really wanted something that we could make our own,? said Mr. Bond, who worked in carpentry in high school and as a general contractor during summers between college. ?We were looking for something we could put some sweat equity into. ? That summer, they found their  : a     prewar apartment in Scarsdale, N. Y. ?The place was    white carpet, which was horrendous,? Mr. Bond said. ?I think it had actually been a pink carpet that had just gotten bleached over the years, because when we moved the dining room table, there was a pink ring under it. ? Mirrored wall panels in the living room had been painted over, and the appliances hadn?t been upgraded since the 1980s. ?We just saw a lot of potential,? Mr. Bond said. Underneath the old carpet, there were beautiful oak floors, and the walls that boxed off the kitchen, living and dining rooms could come down. Not to mention that the place cost about a quarter of what it would have in Brooklyn. They closed on the apartment in July 2015, paying about $240, 000, and immediately began renovating the kitchen, a process that took about five months. Mr. Bond acted as the general contractor, filing for permits and finding subcontractors to build out their vision. A family friend drew up the plans based on the appliances Mr. Bond had in storage. But his obsession with Craigslist did not end. In search of an elusive Miele espresso maker and Viking range, he checked his emails nightly. He admitted he was getting a little carried away when he decided they should buy a   range he found online, although they had already agreed on a   model. ?My wife was like, ?We don?t need that big of a stove in our kitchen. As it is, we have three refrigerators. This is not a commercial kitchen. ?? Putting it more mildly, she added: ?He had the best of intentions, but I had to reel him in on the   range, because it just didn?t fit and we would have had to rework all of our cabinet sizes. ? Mr. Bond ended up buying a   Viking (normally $5, 000) for $1, 500, even though it was set up for propane and their apartment uses natural gas. To salvage the deal, he picked up a conversion kit for about $50 at a local hardware store and did the installation himself after watching a video on YouTube. Then, just as he had resigned himself to drinking regular coffee, a Craigslist alert landed in his inbox for a Miele espresso maker that normally sold for $3, 500. ?A really, really sweet couple? who happened to live nearby were selling it for $500, he said. To find out if it worked, Mr. Bond asked them to make him a cup of coffee, but an error message kept popping up on the espresso maker?s display. Mr. Bond left without the machine, but called a few repair shops and learned that it could be fixed for $300. He returned, offered the couple $200 and it was his. In all, the Bonds paid about $6, 000 for their kitchen appliances, including repairs. Purchased new, the same appliances would have cost roughly $35, 000. Dinner parties are a regular event in their new home, and all three refrigerators are put to use. Although, Mr. Bond admitted, ?It?s all a little overkill  ?   I feel like a food hoarder. ? And the warming drawer that started the whole thing? It was one of the best purchases they made, Ms. Bond said. ?We use it every time we have a group of people over. ?"
17471,Brooks Barnes and Cara Buckley,10/01/2017,2017,1,entertainment,"? The record seven awards for the musical ?La La Land? included for best picture comedy or musical and wins by Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. ?Moonlight? won for best picture drama. ? Meryl Streep gave an impassioned, politically charged speech after receiving the Cecil B. DeMille Award. ? Casey Affleck, Viola Davis, Isabelle Huppert and Tracee Ellis Ross also won awards. Here is a list of the winners. ? And in TV categories, ?The Crown? and ?Atlanta? were triumphant. ? Wesley Morris, Melena Ryzik and Dave Itzkoff provided   commentary. And The Times was also on the red carpet. The     ?La La Land? dominated the 74th Golden Globes on Sunday, receiving a promotional boost in the form of a lavish tribute that kicked off the awards telecast and collecting a record seven prizes, including one for best comedy or musical. No film has won more than four Globes since 1979, when the crime drama ?Midnight Express? received six, the previous   number. ?I?m in a daze now officially,? said the force behind ?La La Land,? Damien Chazelle, 31, as he accepted the directing award. Noting the ?La La Land? plot  ?     dreamers try to make it in show business  ?   Emma Stone said in accepting the award for best actress in a musical or comedy, ?I think that hope and creativity are two of the most important things in the world, and that?s what this movie is about. ? ?La La Land,? made by Lionsgate, also won Globes for song, score, screenplay and actor. The bliss felt by the ?La La Land? cast and crew was likely mirrored by the disappointment of those involved with ?Moonlight,? the night?s    film. Despite six nominations, ?Moonlight,? about a young black man growing up in Miami, received a lone trophy  ?   albeit an important one: best drama. ?Please, tell a friend, tell a friend, tell a friend,? Barry Jenkins, the director of ?Moonlight,? said in accepting the award, trying to boost the art film?s box office performance. A year after Hollywood was excoriated for its lack of diversity at the Oscars, inclusion was a major theme on Sunday. ?This is for all of the women of color and colorful people whose stories, ideas, thoughts are not always considered worthy,? said Tracee Ellis Ross, as she accepted the best television actress Globe for her role in the ABC series ? . ? ?I want you to know that I see you. We see you. ? Ms. Ross was the first black woman to win in the category since 1983, when Debbie Allen won for ?Fame. ? There were several surprises. Isabelle Huppert took best actress in a drama for the French film ?Elle,? beating Natalie Portman, who was favored to win for ?Jackie. ? (?Elle,? a thriller about a businesswoman who tracks her rapist, also won best foreign film.) The foreign journalists who bestow the Globes are known for spreading their awards far and wide, but several films received nothing, including ?Florence Foster Jenkins,? ?Lion,? ?Hacksaw Ridge? and ?Hell or High Water. ? ?Manchester by the Sea,? despite five nominations, was honored only in the best actor category for Casey Affleck. HBO, despite 14 nominations, the most of any network, was shut out altogether. The first award of the night, for best supporting actor, dropped jaws: Aaron   won for his performance in Tom Ford?s   ?Nocturnal Animals,? beating favorites like Mahershala Ali of ?Moonlight. ? ?I made it  ?   thank you,? Mr.   said, looking a bit startled. To the surprise of almost no one, Viola Davis took the supporting actress prize for playing a 1950s homemaker in ?Fences. ? After doling out two kisses, one to her husband and one to Denzel Washington, who directed ?Fences? and stars in it, Ms. Davis thanked its producers for taking a risk on the film. ?It doesn?t scream moneymaker,? she said. ?But it does scream art. It does scream heart. ? Early television awards were widely distributed. The   FX series ?Atlanta,? about an aspiring rapper and his manager cousin, was honored as best comedy and Donald Glover won for best comedic actor for his performance in the show. Beating the likes of Rami Malek (?Mr. Robot?) and Bob Odenkirk (?Better Call Saul?) for best actor in a drama was Billy Bob Thornton, honored for his performance in ?Goliath,? a show with little buzz. Best actress in a TV drama went to Claire Foy, who plays a young Queen Elizabeth II in Netflix?s ?The Crown,? which won for best dramatic series. As expected, ?The People vs. O. J. Simpson: Crime Story? was named best   and Sarah Paulson, repeating her win at the Emmys, collected a trophy for her portrayal of the prosecutor Marcia Clark in that show. A   Ms. Paulson was showered with hugs from   as she returned to her seat. The night got off to a jerky start. After the host, Jimmy Fallon, opened the show with the taped ?La La Land?  number, he became befuddled after a teleprompter malfunction. Still, he kept it breezy. ?Let?s make tonight a celebration,? Mr. Fallon said in his monologue. Despite promises in preshow interviews to zing Donald J. Trump ahead of his inauguration, Mr. Fallon even kept his political jokes to a minimum. ?One of the few places left where America still honors the popular vote,? he said, almost in a mumble. For casual movie fans, the annual Oscar race starts with the Globes. (Oscar nomination ballots are due on Friday.) But the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the group behind the Globes, has worked in recent years to make its television honors more relevant by leaning toward rookie shows like ?The Affair? and ?Transparent. ? Hollywood stylists spent most of the week fretting about the weather forecast. For days, it looked like torrential rain would threaten a repeat of the 2010 Globes ceremony, when the red carpet turned into a swamp. On Sunday, however, Angelenos awakened to ?another day of sun,? to borrow a lyric from ?La La Land. ? When Meryl Streep, a   Globes nominee and   winner, accepted her Cecil B. DeMille lifetime achievement award, she gave an impassioned speech that, while never mentioning Mr. Trump by name, was a clear reaction to the election. ?Take your broken heart, make it into art,? she said, quoting Carrie Fisher. Mr. Trump, in a brief telephone interview, said that he had not watched the Globes or Ms. Streep?s speech, but that he was ?not surprised? that she and some other entertainment figures had criticized him during the Hollywood event. ?Meryl Streep introduced Hillary Clinton at her convention, and a lot of these people supported Hillary,? Mr. Trump said, referring to Ms. Streep?s remarks at the Democratic National Convention last summer on behalf of Mrs. Clinton. While winners steered away from directly criticizing Mr. Trump, several used their moment onstage to take clear jabs. The British actor Hugh Laurie, collecting a   actor award for ?The Night Manager,? said: ?I can say I won this at the   Golden Globes. I mean, it has the words ?Hollywood,? ?Foreign? and ?Press? in it. ? He added, ?I also think to some Republicans, even the word ?Association? is sketchy. ? Some Trump supporters, either anticipating the barbs or irritated that many Hollywood stars have been outspoken in their horror at his election, made #BoycottGoldenGlobes trend on Twitter early on Sunday. The Golden Globes are great fun, and so is its red carpet. Among this year?s first arrivals were the Stallone sisters, this year?s Miss Golden Globes, shepherded about by their father Sylvester?s     publicist no buttering up of reporters. A news crew from Canada was promised a question with the sisters but then told ?They need to go do Twitter? first. Issa Rae and Donald Glover were among the luminaries who admitted to feeling slightly intimidated to being there. Mr. Glover said he really wanted to meet Ms. Davis, and that he was still shocked at the huge response to ?Atlanta,? his FX series. ?It was supposed to be a punk show,? he said. ?And they screened it at A. F. I. and Scorsese was laughing. ? Ms. Rae, of the HBO show ?Insecure,? said she was still adjusting to her growing fame. ?I?m an introvert, I barely leave the house,? she said. ?To be out here is a blessing but I?m like: ?Wow, guys. It?s just me. ? Even though Netflix has upended the TV industry, that streaming service had never won in the best drama or comedy category at the Globes (and the Emmys, for that matter). That changed this year with ?The Crown,?  which was named best drama. Claire Foy, who plays Queen Elizabeth, won for best actress in a drama. ?The Crown? beat out ?Stranger Things,? also from Netflix ?Westworld,? the HBO series that practically requires a Ph. D. to understand it NBC?s   ?This Is Us? and HBO?s ?Game of Thrones. ? Another closely watched television race was for best comedic actress, where Ms. Ross beat out some stiff competition to become the first black woman to win in the category since Debbie Allen in 1983. Also nominated were the   Globe winner Sarah Jessica Parker, for her role as a   suburban mother in HBO?s ?Divorce? Ms. Rae, nominated for her   performance in HBO?s ?Insecure? Julia   from the network?s ?Veep? and last year?s winner, Rachel Bloom (?Crazy  ?). Globe voters have ardently tried to leave behind their reputation for paying more attention to celebrity than honoring the year?s best performances. Once upon a time, Globe attendees also bellied up to the open bar in a boozy spectacle, but nominees  ?   heeding the scolding eyes of their publicists  ?   have largely started sticking to water. Despite moments of seriousness, however, the Globes lived up its raucous reputation. The ?Modern Family? star Sofia Vergara made anus jokes from the stage. NBC censors bleeped expletives from Amy Schumer. Dinner guests in multiple instances chatted right through the speeches. As ever, the ballroom?s smoking patio was chockablock with stars at one moment, Sophie Turner from ?Game of Thrones? lit her cigarette off one held by her   Maisie Williams. The young ?Stranger Things? cast members ran around taking selfies. As ever, the ceremony?s success will be determined by the Nielsen ratings. About 18. 5 million people watched last year, down from 19. 3 million in 2015. Televised award shows in general have been suffering from viewer erosion, partly because there is a seemingly endless array of them, but NBC had high hopes for Mr. Fallon. He has a much wider fan base than Mr. Gervais and has been using his ?Tonight Show? perch as a promotional platform for the gig."
17416,Eric Lipton and Maggie Haberman,7/01/2017,2017,1,law,"WASHINGTON  ?   Eric Trump has helped raise $16. 3 million for St. Jude Children?s Research Hospital of Tennessee over the past decade, a hospital official said in a letter sent to a charity run by Mr. Trump, the  ?s son. The letter comes as Mr. Trump is preparing to remove his name from the charity to avoid conflicts of interest that could emerge from future  . The letter confirms an account Mr. Trump gave to reporters that his organization has raised more than $15 million for the hospital, despite available tax records showing that the Eric Trump Foundation raised less than half that amount. Mr. Trump?s announcement that he will remove his name from the organization is one of a series of steps that members of the Trump family are taking to address potential conflicts before the inauguration. Other steps include terminating planned Trump Organization projects in countries like Azerbaijan, Brazil, Colombia and Georgia. In addition to removing his name from his charitable foundation, Mr. Trump will no longer personally solicit funds for it, he said in several interviews with The New York Times. To further avoid conflicts, Mr. Trump said in an email this week, his    and a Trump Organization executive will step down from the foundation?s executive committee. The Trump Organization will continue to raise money for St. Jude from patrons at its hotels and golf courses, Mr. Trump said. But it will ask them to make contributions directly to the hospital, he said, instead of first sending the money to the Trump Organization. The St. Jude letter said that since its establishment, the Eric Trump Foundation had raised  ?   or helped raise through affiliated groups  ?   $16. 3 million for the hospital, which offers free care to needy children. Tax documents filed by nonprofit foundations are often delayed by two years, so there is no public accounting of these totals yet available. The letter said that some of the money was raised via related efforts, such as an Eric Trump   team that participates in the New York City Marathon. ?I am amazed by the many ways that you have personally embraced our cause and cared for our children and families,? Richard C. Shadyac Jr. president of the hospital?s   organization, wrote in the Dec. 30 letter, which Mr. Trump provided to The Times. ?As you are aware, we are expanding our lifesaving work and are working to push cure rates even higher in this country and around the world, while improving the lives of survivors by developing and advancing treatments that reduce side effects. We are only able to do this because of the support provided by donors and supporters like you. ? In his email this week, Mr. Trump said he would ?continue to be a vocal advocate for pediatric cancer and St. Jude?s mission. ?   Donald J. Trump has announced that he is shutting down his own personal foundation, although it is currently the target of an investigation by the New York State attorney general over accusations that it did not have the proper permit to solicit contributions, and that it may have used money to benefit Mr. Trump?s own interests. No such accusations have been made about Eric Trump?s foundation."
18016,Cecilia Kang,31/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"WASHINGTON  ?   Few companies have been as intimately tied to the Democratic Party in recent years as Google. So now that Donald J. Trump is president, the giant company, in Silicon Valley parlance, is having to pivot. The shift was evident a day after Congress began its new session this month. That evening, about 70 lawmakers, a majority of them Republicans, were feted at the stately Smithsonian Arts and Industries Building, where they clinked champagne and bourbon glasses and posed for selfies with the 600 guests assembled in their honor. The event?s main host was not from the Republican establishment. Instead, the party was primarily financed and anchored by Google. ?We?ve partnered with Google on events before, but nothing like this party,? said Alex Skatell, founder of The Independent Journal Review, a news   with a   millennial audience, which also helped host the event. The event was emblematic of an   by Google. Over the last eight years, the company was closely associated with former President Barack Obama. Google employees overwhelmingly supported Mr. Obama?s presidential campaigns, and some later took roles in his administration. Eric Schmidt, the chairman of Alphabet, Google?s parent company,  advised the Obama White House. And last year, Google employees gave $1. 3 million to Hillary Clinton?s campaign to succeed Mr. Obama, compared with $26, 000 to the Trump campaign, according to federal filings. Now, the tech giant is scrambling to forge ties with Mr. Trump?s new administration and to strengthen its relationship with a   Congress. Most important, Google is trying to change the perception that it is a Democratic stronghold. That has led to events like the party at the Smithsonian, which the institution said had cost at least $50, 000. Mr. Schmidt has embarked on an East Coast charm offensive of Republican political leaders, including twice visiting Mr. Trump and his advisers at Trump Tower. Last month, Google also posted an opening to fill a position for a ?conservative outreach? employee in its Washington office. ?Google has a target on its back because it is fundamentally viewed as a Democratic company,? said Gigi Sohn, a former senior adviser to Tom Wheeler, who was chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. ?Even though it has reached out to Republicans, it can?t shake the image. ? Google said it had long had Republican lobbyists and had not changed its strategy. ?We?ve worked with both Republicans and Democrats for over a decade, advocating policies to encourage economic growth, innovation and entrepreneurialism,? the company said in a statement. ?We?ll continue to do exactly that. ? A spokesman for Mr. Schmidt added, ?Eric has a long record of working constructively and energetically on important technology issues with American and world leaders across the political spectrum. ? Other Silicon Valley tech companies, like Facebook, are in a similar predicament. The perception is that they lean left and their executives backed Mrs. Clinton. Many are now also pledging to work with Mr. Trump and paid court to the new president at a December tech summit meeting. One week into the administration, Google and other tech companies began to push back, criticizing Mr. Trump?s executive order on immigration bans. The company said an estimated 187 employees were affected by the order and it urged any of those employees who were abroad to work with the company to return safely to the United States. ?It?s painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues,? Sundar Pichai, Google?s chief executive, said in a memo to employees over the weekend. ?We?ve always made our views on immigration issues known publicly and will continue to do so. ? Google has much at stake as it repositions itself. During the Obama years, Google avoided American antitrust charges, even as European regulators accused the firm of antitrust violations in search and in its mobile business. Google also successfully pushed a policy agenda that included the creation of net neutrality rules in 2015 and the defeat of online piracy laws in 2012. Now warning shots against Google have been fired by those in Mr. Trump?s circle. Some of the president?s advisers have debated whether the tech behemoth deserves more antitrust scrutiny, according to two people briefed by the new administration?s transition team, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Peter Thiel, a venture capitalist and Trump transition adviser, also compared the power that Google had under Mr. Obama to that which the oil giant Exxon Mobil had under President George W. Bush. Under President Bush, the administration largely agreed with Exxon?s skeptical stance on climate change policy. Mr. Trump?s team is particularly wary of one Google executive  ?   Mr. Schmidt  ?   who has been allied with Democrats. During last year?s presidential campaign, Mr. Schmidt counseled Mrs. Clinton on strategy. A photo of him wearing a staff badge at her   party circulated widely in the conservative media. Mr. Trump?s advisers, including his chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, have complained about Mr. Schmidt?s funding of a   called the Groundwork, which provided data and other technology for Mrs. Clinton?s campaign. They also suspected Google was skewing search results in favor of Mrs. Clinton, said Barry Bennett, a former senior adviser for Mr. Trump?s campaign. ?Mr. Schmidt spent millions and millions of his personal money to defeat Donald Trump,? Mr. Bennett said. ?It takes a particular amount of gumption to pretend that never happened. ? Google has denied it tweaked its search results, which are determined by algorithms, and the company declined to comment on Mr. Schmidt. White House officials did not respond to a request for comment. For many years, Google?s support of Democrats was plain. Google?s political action committee and employees ranked third in all donations to Mr. Obama?s 2012 campaign at $804, 240, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. In 2008, Google?s PAC and employees were sixth with $817, 855. The company did not rank in the top 20 for donations to Mr. Obama?s Republican opponents in either of those elections. About five years ago, Google began diversifying its bets. The company forged ties with the   House of Representatives and started addressing the beginning of an antitrust investigation into whether the company was using its search dominance to suppress competing travel, map and restaurant sites. In 2011, Google hired Stewart Jeffries, a former member of the House Judiciary Committee, to lobby Republicans on Capitol Hill. That same year, it quadrupled its number of outside lobbying firms  ?   including many with Republican lobbyists  ?   to 24, from six in 2010. In 2012, Google named a former Republican congresswoman, Susan Molinari of New York, to lead its Washington office. Google also sponsored conservative think tanks such as the American Enterprise Institute and the Heritage Foundation. The company has hosted Republican lawmakers including the House majority leader, Kevin McCarthy of California, and Darrell Issa of California at its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. Google?s Washington office is now roughly split between Republican and Democrats. The company spent $15. 43 million in lobbying in 2016, according to federal lobbying documents, making it among the top dozen firms in lobbying spending last year. For the first time last year, Google?s PAC gave more to Republican congressional candidates than to Democrats, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Even so, Google?s Republican ties got little notice because of the company?s strong relationship with Democrats. Several Google employees joined the Obama administration while dozens of government bureaucrats were employed by the tech company. Google?s head of global public policy, Caroline Atkinson, was Mr. Obama?s former national security adviser. A former Google executive, Megan Smith, became the nation?s chief technology officer. During his presidency, Mr. Obama also repeatedly supported proposals backed by Google, including net neutrality in 2015 and cable   box reforms last year. ?Google was very much treated as the golden child by the Obama administration,? said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, which has been critical of Google for privacy policies. Since the election, Google has accelerated efforts to win over the Republican White House and Congress. Before his visits to Trump Tower, Mr. Schmidt met with Mr. McCarthy and Senator John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, who is chairman of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. Days after Mr. Trump?s victory, Google also contacted The Independent Journal Review, which it had worked with on events during the Republican campaign debates. Google told the news   that it would provide the main funding for the party at the Smithsonian. Google said the event was open to both parties. But pairing with the conservative site sent a clear message to attendees. ?We definitely helped draw Republicans and people from across the spectrum,? said the site?s founder, Mr. Skatell. At the party, several Republican lawmakers were positive about their tech host, brushing off questions about the company?s heft and power. ?When I think of technology and Google, I don?t think of dominance,? said Representative Bradley Byrne, a Republican from Alabama. ?I think of innovation. ?"
17812,Holland Cotter,19/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"?In the Trumpian sense of the term, she?s the ultimate ?nasty woman.? An inspiration. Volcanic. When I start to write about her, I always feel,  . ? The volcano referred to is Emily Dickinson, as described by the contemporary poet Susan Howe in the catalog for an exhibition, ?I?m Nobody! Who are you? The Life and Poetry of Emily Dickinson,? opening on Friday at the Morgan Library  Museum. The show is one of the largest gatherings ever of prime Dickinson relics, and it comes with an aura the size of a city block. It instantly turns the Morgan into a pilgrimage site, a literary Lourdes, a place to come in contact with one aspect of American culture that truly can claim greatness, which we sure can use in an   political moment. The show has a mission: To give   audiences a fresh take on Dickinson. Gone is the   Puritan nun, and that infantilized charmer, the Belle of Amherst. At the Morgan we get a different Dickinson, a person among people: a member of a household, a   a citizen. She was born in 1830 to rural gentry in Western Massachusetts, and one of the earliest items in the show gives an impression of modest Yankee privilege. It?s a portrait of Dickinson at around age 10 with her older brother, Austin, and young sister, Lavinia, done by a local artist, Otis Allen. It?s sort of a big deal to have it here: This is the first time it has left Houghton Library at Harvard since it arrived there in 1950. And the Morgan displays it well, against   wallpaper that replicates the original, only recently uncovered, in Emily?s Amherst bedroom. In a sweet coincidence, the roses on the paper echo the flower the    holds in her portrait. As the daughter of a    ?   her father, Edward, was elected to the United States Congress in 1853  ?   and a lifelong consumer of newspapers and periodicals, Dickinson had a good sense of what was happening in the world. She went to grammar school, and was a bookworm, but had friends and a poised, dry sense of humor, as some teasing early letters to her brother suggests. In 1847, she spent a year as a boarding student at Mount Holyoke Female Seminary, her one stint in higher education. And from that time came what many devotees will consider the exhibition?s star attraction: the   daguerreotype of the    Dickinson with her pale skin and   eyes. It?s another rare visitant  ?   it last left home at Amherst College in 1986  ?   and it?s almost a shock to see how small it is:   like a holy card or a talisman. Dickinson said that she liked Mount Holyoke, but I don?t know. It had its stresses. Part of the curriculum was religious, with students expected to make a profession of faith before graduating. The school informally divided potential candidates into three categories: those who would readily comply those who would need some persuasion and ?? to whom they paid special attention. Dickinson, who had developed an allergy to orthodoxy, was a   and proud. It?s important, in presenting a revisionist view of her, especially a normalizing one, to note that from the start, resistance was her natural mode, and one that grew increasingly pronounced, and eventually acute. The end of her schooling signaled the start of a new phase of her life. She was again at home and beginning to work in a serious way on poetry, which required concentration and a degree of isolation: a commitment, the willingness, I guess you could say, to make a vow. I think it wasn?t easy. The 1850s were a period of personal tumult. Her school friends had dispersed. Several had married. Among them was Susan Gilbert, with whom she had forged a tight emotional and intellectual bond, and whom she relied on as a first reader and editor of her poetry. In 1856, Gilbert  ?   there?s a picture of her here  ?   married Austin and lived with him in the house next door to the family homestead. By 1858, Dickinson had accumulated enough poems to begin collecting them in handwritten,   booklets known as fascicles. And from around this time comes what is thought to be another portrait, a daguerreotype that surfaced in 2012 and is on   public view at the Morgan. It?s a portrait of two seated women, the one on the left tentatively identified as Dickinson the other one as her friend, and possible romantic partner, Kate Scott Turner. In the show, it?s placed side by side with the earlier, authenticated photograph. The Dickinsons in each, with their candid, unguarded gaze, share a clear, if inconclusive, resemblance. And her pose in the dual portrait is extremely moving. Far from being the timid, removed figure of myth, she looks directly at the camera and reaches, in a   to touch the back of her friend. Much of Dickinson?s poetry from this time has an experimental, incendiary flair images of combat and violence occur. It?s as if she were experiencing the Civil War before it happened. And when it did happen, her production soared. Oddly, in the midst of the conflict, war was rarely her active theme. But like Walt Whitman, who began working as the equivalent of a psychiatric nurse in a military hospital in Washington, Dickinson seems to have been caught up in the   atmosphere that gripped the nation, a mood probably not entirely different from the one found in a divided America now. Whitman was permanently shaped by the war and its waste. Whether Dickinson was, I don?t know. But when it was over, her life changed. She began to withdraw. Communication was through writing: letters as intricately composed as puzzles, notes as brief as tweets, poems sent out like gifts. The primary relics from this time forward are her manuscripts of poems. Nearly 1, 800 survive 24 examples are in the show, organized by Mike Kelly, head of archives and special collections at Amherst College, and Carolyn Vega, assistant curator in the Morgan?s department of literary and historical manuscripts. The manuscripts come with questions of legibility. Dickinson?s penmanship grew eccentric over time, as did her compositional methods. Transcribing her work has become a complex science, particularly in the matter of rendering the alternative phrases and words she included in drafts. It was as if she were deliberately creating poems that demanded reader participation, poems that could be endlessly rewritten. And maybe as her conviction grew that she would always be her own best audience, she turned poems into art objects, sculptures and pictures: A draft of a poem that begins ?The way hope builds his house? is composed on a bit of paper  ?   an envelope flap?  ?   shaped like a house. In the show?s catalog, aptly titled ?The Networked Recluse: The Connected World of Emily Dickinson,? the art historian Marta Werner analyzes the visual nature of the manuscripts. Yet what matters most in Dickinson is the element most easily passed over in an exhibition: words. And they warn us, whenever we focus on them, against trying to normalize Dickinson, against trying to make her acceptable and explicable. She was an outsider, and as such a disrupter. Was she a feminist? Not in the modern sense, though an idea of female power as a protean force was central to her thinking, as it was to the writers she loved: Emily Bront?, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, George Eliot. Central, too, was her disdain for the false power of churches, fathers, governments, God, ego. Even her most   poems, like the one for which the show is named, slice away at that power: This little anthem to outsider solidarity, delivered with a   lift, is both cute and furious, a joke and a call to arms. Some of its references translate neatly into the present of ethical bogs, Pepe the Frog, a new   . Its paranoia is of the moment, too, for many with a grain of Otherness in their makeup. Dickinson did, as a woman who said no to a culture that wanted her to be a wife, a mother, a social creature on its terms, when she had other plans. And to pursue them she assumed the guise of a Nobody: invisible, independent,   ignoring the knock on the door. The fringe for her was a position of strength, not deprivation. This truth should not be lost in the rebranding campaigns periodically conducted on her behalf. Nor should it be forgotten that defending difference took a lifelong fight, one which she was willing and able  ?   supremely able  ?   to wage. That?s a revolutionary talking. And her voice carries, subaudibly explosive, through this show."
17636,Ron Lieber,14/01/2017,2017,1,business,"When Wells Fargo announced its quarterly earnings Friday morning, it was clear that many of its customers were not exactly pleased. In recent months, the number of new consumer checking accounts had fallen sharply, which is no surprise for a bank that paid a hefty fine in September for opening accounts of all sorts without customers? permission. Just for good measure, it?s trying to force customers who want to sue to take their disputes to mandatory arbitration. And in its earnings announcement, the company said that measurements of ?loyalty? were going to take awhile longer to recover. To many consumers, Wells Fargo deserves a kind of death penalty: In the same way one might never buy a car again from the cheaters at Volkswagen, it makes little sense to do business with Wells Fargo either. But an equally good reason to steer clear might be this: Its products and services are mostly middling. The bank rarely is a leader on pricing or rewards. It specializes in ubiquity, with storefronts in all 50 states, and it hopes that we?ll be too lazy to find better deals elsewhere. The bank claims to be serious about pivoting now (despite having only shuffled the deck chairs in its executive roster, ousting its C. E. O. and elevating his top deputy). So if it wants to stand for something in the minds of consumers other than shoving unwanted products down people?s throats, it might try new approaches  ?   like generosity, clarity, integrity and good citizenship  ?   on for size instead. Let?s take some of those things, and the bank?s ? ? offerings, in order: GENEROSITY Consider Wells Fargo?s basic savings account offerings. Or don?t, lest you be insulted by the interest rates. How does 0. 01 percent sound to you? But if you have more than $100, 000 that you need to keep safe for a while, the bank will increase that amount tenfold, to a whopping 0. 1 percent! Is there something about being a large financial institution that makes offering a competitive interest rate impossible? Not at all. Household names like Barclays, Discover and Goldman Sachs are happy to give you at least nine times what Wells Fargo does. The news isn?t much better for credit cards. While American Express, Citi and Chase shower consumers with bonuses and perks, Wells Fargo plods along with   and reward card lineups that do not make the leader board for largess. Its bankers do this because they can, because they relied for years on a pushy sales culture in the branches where even people who actually said ?yes? to the pitches weren?t in a position to compare them in the moment. So the bank didn?t need to have the best products. That flair for mediocrity may no longer work. Consumer credit card applications declined by a stunning 43 percent in December, 2016, compared with the same month a year earlier. The new Wells Fargo script might go like this: Many of our bankers tried to use you in the worst possible way, so we get why you?re staying away from our cards. But now we?re going to give more things away to all of you who stay loyal to us in our moment of professed contrition. Here?s one idea for starters: Given its status as a leader in mortgage lending and servicing, the bank ought to double what it pays out on its Home Rebate Signature credit card to people who use the rewards to pay down additional principal on their loans. At least 2 percent cash back is a good benchmark. CLARITY In its acquisition of Wachovia, Wells Fargo ended up with responsibility for a number of mortgage loans from an outfit called World Savings Bank. Many of those loans put borrowers in situations where their payments did not cover all of their interest costs, and some of those borrowers did not know it. Victor Amerling, who lives in Tenafly, N. J. is one borrower who had this kind of   negative amortization adjustable rate loan. He approached me for help months ago after having no luck getting Wells Fargo to explain to him how  ?   when he explicitly signed up for a biweekly payment program designed to help him and his wife pay off their loan seven years early  ?   he ended up in a situation where that will not happen after all. His letter from a Wells Fargo executive resolution specialist did not mention the nature of his loan Mr. Amerling learned of it only after I intervened with the company on his behalf and it disclosed that it had been in negative amortization territory for four years. Instead, the letter said that ?we are unable to confirm when your loan will mature by making biweekly payments. ? According to the bank, that?s because the interest rate on his loan adjusts so often that it?s impossible to assess, though he could refinance if he wanted more certainty. In 2000, however, World Savings had given him a piece of paper showing a 2023 payoff date. ?This was on an ironically termed ?Truth in Lending? statement,? Mr. Amerling said. ?They baited me with 23 years, and nobody ever mentioned negative amortization to me. Not my lawyer, not the mortgage broker, not the bank?s lawyer, nobody. ? Wells Fargo did not cause this problem. But why hasn?t Wells Fargo been resetting his payments and those of people like him each year to keep them on track toward their goal of paying off their mortgage early? Vickee Adams, a spokeswoman, said the bank didn?t know who was in which payment plan or for what reason. Some people are in biweekly plans to pair their mortgage payment up with their biweekly paychecks, for instance. The bank still holds just under $39 billion in outstanding mortgage loans like Mr. Amerling?s. So a word of warning to anyone there or elsewhere with a mortgage that has an adjustable rate or is even remotely exotic:   with your bank each and every year to make sure you are on track to pay off the loan on your intended schedule. INTEGRITY Wells Fargo would like to help you invest your life savings, and it has an army of financial professionals standing by to help. But last year, three academics issued a working paper that ranked brokerage firms by the percentage of their investment professionals who had at least one black mark on their industry disciplinary records. Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network was the third worst: 15. 3 percent of the representatives had, say, been fired from a previous job for cause, settled a consumer dispute in the past or run into a severe financial problem of their own. That?s more than double the industrywide figure, which led the researchers to assume that financial institutions with high percentages were ?specializing in misconduct. ? This is not a good look for an institution that has also admitted to signing banking customers up for products that they did not need and never asked for. Wells Fargo disputes the ?misconduct specialization? label, though. ?We wholeheartedly disagree with that assertion,? said Helen Bow, a spokeswoman. She added that in 2015, 434 people applied for affiliation with its network. (The advisers fly the Wells Fargo flag and tap into its resources but are not   employees.) Just 8. 3 percent of them had any sort of disclosure, and the bank accepted only 15 of the 434 total applicants. That represents real progress. One possibility here: a public declaration that its goal is to get that misconduct figure under, say, 4 percent for its advisers. GOOD CITIZENSHIP A bank with the size and resources of Wells Fargo should be able to innovate when it wants to, and there are signs that it can. The bank?s yourLoanTracker tool has the potential to help many mortgage applicants know exactly where they are in the process and what paperwork the bank needs, is missing or has lost. But at a moment when so many Americans are ready to turn their backs on elites and their institutions, this would be the perfect moment for a large financial services firm to say loudly and proudly that it stands for bringing many more struggling people back into the banking system. In her new book, ?The Unbanking of America: How the New Middle Class Survives,? Lisa Servon, who worked in the   and   business as part of her research, offers a laundry list of   innovations that any bank could adopt. Wells Fargo executives should turn right to Chapter 8 to see them. There, she mentions KeyBank, a regional player with a   checking account now known as the ?  Account. ? Wells Fargo has a similar offering that it could build on called ?Opportunity Checking,? but it?s harder to avoid fees with that one. Nobody wants Wells Fargo to go away. Affluent people want more choices in financial services and better service, and   people urgently need them. So the bank ought not to run and hide. ?That might be their instinct in the wake of their own crisis, to not take any risks and serve the same people in the same way and just try to keep their hands clean,? Ms. Servon said. ?But they should take some risk with innovation. ?"
17505,Mark Landler,10/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"WASHINGTON  ?   The Obama administration has blacklisted five Russians, including the government?s chief public investigator, who is a close aide to President Vladimir V. Putin, for human rights abuses, laying down a marker for   Donald J. Trump less than two weeks before he takes office with a vow to thaw relations with Russia. The sanctions, announced Monday by the Treasury Department, are not related to allegations of Russian hacking during the presidential election, according to a senior administration official. But they carry symbolic weight at a charged moment, as likely the last visible act the United States will take against Russia before power is transferred in Washington. The biggest name added to the list is that of Aleksandr I. Bastrykin, who reports directly to Mr. Putin and has carried out political investigations on his behalf. Mr. Bastrykin, officials said, was complicit in the case of Sergei L. Magnitsky, a lawyer who died in detention in murky circumstances in November 2009 and for whom the Magnitsky Act was named. Under that 2012 law, passed by Congress with Democratic and Republican support, the Treasury and Justice Departments must investigate and penalize Russian individuals involved in that case and subsequent   or in other human rights abuses. The Obama administration has now put 44 people on the list. The sanctions announced Monday include a ban on travel to the United States and a freezing of any assets held by or transactions with American financial institutions. The White House has enforced the law with varying degrees of enthusiasm, depending on relations between the United States and Russia. In late 2013, human rights activists said, it delayed releasing the list because it worried that the move  ?   coming just before the Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia  ?   would further curdle relations. But the administration?s final list, particularly with the inclusion of Mr. Bastrykin, is considered robust. ?The mood and atmosphere are very different this year,? said David J. Kramer, the senior director for human rights and democracy at the McCain Institute for International Leadership, a policy research center. ?Adding a few more names to the sanctions list sends a couple of signals,? Mr. Kramer said. ?That this administration, as it goes out the door, is still going to implement the Magnitsky Act. It?s also sending a signal to the next administration that it hopes it will continue this policy. ? Shortly after the law was passed, Russia?s Parliament banned the adoption of Russian children by Americans. In 2013, Russia released a list of Americans barred from traveling to Russia because of what it claimed were human rights violations. Late last year, Congress passed legislation that would impose sanctions on people anywhere in the world for the kinds of human rights abuses that surfaced in the Magnitsky case. Much to the frustration of the Russian government, the bill again bore his name. In December, the Treasury Department put sanctions on 15 Russian individuals and companies for their dealings in Crimea and Ukraine. Mr. Trump is widely expected to ease that campaign. On Monday, Kellyanne Conway, one of his top advisers, said Mr. Trump might also relax the sanctions imposed by Mr. Obama in response to the hacking, which include travel bans and financial restrictions on senior Russian intelligence officials. ?I predict that President Trump will want to make sure that our actions are proportionate to what occurred, based on what we know,? she said in an interview with USA Today. It will be harder for him to ignore the requirements of the Magnitsky Act, but the administration has considerable flexibility in how aggressively it pursues people. ?The bureaucracy will grind away and produce more names, but senior people have the final say,? said Michael A. McFaul, a former American ambassador to Russia. In addition to Mr. Bastrykin, the administration is targeting Andrei K. Lugovoi and Dmitri V. Kovtun, two Russian intelligence officers who the British authorities said poisoned a fellow Russian spy, Alexander V. Litvinenko, in London in 2006. Also added to the list are Stanislav Gordievsky and Gennady Plaksin, two   officials, who the United States said were involved in the   of Mr. Magnitsky?s death."
17798,Elisabetta Povoledo and Gerry Mullany,20/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"ROME  ?   As night fell in Italy?s Apennine Mountains on Thursday, prospects dimmed of finding survivors of an avalanche that had swept over a small resort hotel the previous night. At least 30 people were missing, according to the authorities. The avalanche occurred after four earthquakes struck central Italy, which has been hit hard in recent months. Giampiero Parete, a cook at the Rigopiano hotel and one of the two known survivors, had gone out to get something from his car when the avalanche struck. His wife and two young children remained inside and are among the missing. Quintino Marcella, a restaurateur, told the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera that he had received a frantic call for help from Mr. Parete on Wednesday night. Mr. Parete told him that the hotel had been wiped out: ?The hotel isn?t here anymore, it?s not here,? Mr. Marcella told the newspaper. He said that the guests had been waiting for a snow plow to clear the roads. ?All the guests had their bags packed and were waiting to leave,? he said. Mr. Marcella said that he called the prefecture in Pescara, and an official told him that they had spoken to the hotel a few hours earlier and that everything was under control. ?I insisted,? Mr. Marcella told Corriere della Sera. He said that he called police, the carabinieri, until someone finally said ?maybe there?s something there. ? The authorities told the Italian media that they responded as soon as they learned of the disaster. The latest seismic activity, which prompted officials to close schools and the subway system in Rome as a precaution, shifted the nation?s attention back to areas in central Italy that were devastated by last year?s earthquakes, leading to criticism that victims had been left to fend for themselves. Fabrizio Curcio, the chief of the civil protection department, told RAI News that    teams had reached the hotel but that they faced an enormous challenge. Rescue workers, including dog units, were moving with caution he said, and some   teams reported no signs of survivors. News channels in Italy showed images of the roof collapsed on the Rigopiano, and    photographs suggesting that much of the structure had been buried by the avalanche. The last time Fulvio Vagnarelli heard from his brother Marco, who was staying at the hotel with his girlfriend Paola Tomassini, it was via a social media message late on Wednesday afternoon. ?He told me that they were about to leave but that they were delayed because of the snow,? Mr. Vagnarelli told the Ansa news agency. Cars were blocking the road, ?and they were waiting for it to be cleared. ? The father of a woman who worked at the hotel told Radio24 that the staff had asked to leave after the quake ?because it was felt very strongly up there, and so they asked to come down. But there were three meters of snow, how were they supposed to leave?? Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni said the rescue effort presented officials with ?unprecedented? difficulties, describing the area as caught in a vise after intense snowfall ?that hadn?t been recorded for decades,? and the strong earthquakes on Wednesday. The epicenters of the four earthquakes were in central Italy, which has been hit by deadly quakes with increasing frequency in recent years. Officials registered more than 100 aftershocks on Thursday. Emergency vehicles tried to assist mountain rescue teams in the region, part of the Gran Sasso National Park, but their efforts were hampered by heavy snow. Francesco Provolo, the prefect of Pescara, the province that includes Farindola, told RAI that rescuers had to travel more than five miles on skis and snowshoes to reach the hotel, as billowing snow continued to fall throughout the night. A spokesman for the civil protection department in Pescara estimated that up to 30 people were in the hotel at the time of the avalanche. The   hotel has 43 rooms, but it was not clear how many guests were staying there at the time of the avalanche. Rescue efforts continued at the hotel, which officials said had been swept from its foundations by the avalanche. Walter Milan, a spokesman for a specialized mountain rescue team, told RAI that rescuers were examining the scene of the avalanche section by section ?to exclude that people remained trapped underneath. ? In the nearby hamlet of Ortolano, which has been cut off by the snow, 21 people were airlifted by helicopter to the airport in L?Aquila, said a spokesman for the Italian Financial Police, which was involved in the rescue operations. Three quakes in central Italy last year killed nearly 300 people in and around the medieval town of Amatrice on Wednesday, the tower of one of that town?s churches was destroyed by temblors. In 2009, the town of L?Aquila was devastated by an earthquake that killed more than 300 people. The latest earthquakes were a new setback for thousands of commercial, industrial and agricultural enterprises in four central Italian regions that have been struggling to recover from the natural disasters of the summer and fall. Mr. Gentiloni praised the courage of rescue workers trying to reach the hotel, and he said the country?s ?heart and mind? were closely following their efforts. ?Everyone is doing as much as they can? to reach people, clear roads and bring electricity to areas that have been cut off for days, the prime minister said. ?But I ask all operators to increase their commitment. They have shown that they exist, are present, and are working  ?   but I ask them, if possible, to do even more. ? The avalanche had buried cars and nearly everything else in its path. The National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology said that more than 47, 000 temblors and aftershocks had rattled the region since August, and that there was no sign the situation would change anytime soon. After the earthquake in L?Aquila in 2009, the earth shook for four years, even though it wasn?t always perceptible to people, said Carlo Meletti, the director of the seismic hazard center at the institute. ?We expect the sequence will last for many weeks,? he said. ?After yesterday?s quakes, it is as though it has picked up in vigor. ? ?We have always said that there were strong possibilities of new, stronger earthquakes, and now a new fault has opened,? he continued. ?The one thing we don?t know is when they will occur or where, because the area that has been affected by the quakes is so vast. ? Mr. Meletti said in a telephone interview that it was unclear if the avalanche was a direct result of the earthquakes on Wednesday, but that a link was possible ?considering that a lot of snow had fallen in a very short time and it was very unstable. ? Echoing a refrain heard after the earthquakes last year, many residents complained on social media that they had been abandoned, even as officials pledged that they were doing everything they could to reach stranded towns and hamlets. ?Only the earthquake remembers the earthquake victims,? a banner headline on the front page of the newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano read on Thursday."
17328,John Otis,2/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"In 2007, Rey Canunayon and his wife, MaryGwen, immigrated to the United States from the island of Mindanao in the Philippines. In doing so, they were fulfilling their family?s dreams. For years, her parents had requested that the Canunayons join them in New York City. But her parents died before that could happen. Mr. Canunayon felt remorse about not honoring their wishes while they were alive. Still, he and his wife wanted to embark on the adventure and make the move. ?America is a great nation, a kind nation, a nation of greener pastures and milk and honey and endless possibilities,? Mr. Canunayon said. When the couple arrived, they stayed with Ms. Canunayon?s family in New Jersey. Life was exciting, even relaxing, Mr. Canunayon said. But as they settled in a new country, he struggled to find work and grew despondent. ?Oh, my God, I have cried a river because I was in a depression,? said Mr. Canunayon, now 46. He found relaxation riding the subway, one station to the next, so long as it kept moving. ?When you come from a place where you are so familiar, your own country, you have friends, relatives, connections, a career. And then you?re stripped of everything except your dignity it?s really hard,? he said. Eventually, the couple were able to move into an apartment of their own in Elmhurst, Queens. They also secured employment. He works at a   laundry, while his wife, 49, is a babysitter, a midwife and a nanny. In October 2015, they received their green cards. Beyond that, Mr. Canunayon, who left a career in nonprofit work in the Philippines, has recommitted himself to working to help people and neighborhoods change for the better. Only this time, he is not collecting a paycheck for it. ?God gave knowledge for free, skills for free, talent for free, so I?ll give it for free,? Mr. Canunayon said. He volunteers at the couple?s place of worship in Elmhurst, St. Adalbert Roman Catholic Church. He also helps other Filipino immigrants. ?I cannot imagine myself not sharing the skills and   talent that I have,? he said. But because this effort doesn?t come with a salary, it doesn?t help pay the bills. It took one episode, when the Canunayons received a $600 medical bill for lab tests in September, for them to plummet into financial instability. ?It was a big problem, Mr. Canunayon said. ?What will happen to us if we can?t pay the rent?? He came across a possible solution on one of his volunteer outings for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn and the Filipino Consulate, where he was helping people renew their passports. He mentioned his financial problems to Greg Hankins, a volunteer he had met that day. Mr. Hankins encouraged him to contact another group, Community Health Advocates. It is operated by the Community Service Society, one of eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. The Community Service Society did help, providing $641. 45 in Neediest Cases money to cover the couple?s outstanding medical bills. They also got help obtaining health insurance. While grateful for the assistance, they continue to worry about everyday challenges: making ends meet, sending money back to their families and carefully monitoring their finances. ?It?s the same situation, financially struggling and trying to get myself back into the saddle,? Mr. Canunayon said. He continues to search for jobs in the nonprofit sector. In the Philippines, he worked in research, advocacy and policy legislation, which led to the development of sustainable organic agriculture to feed the poor. The cause was personal: Many members of his family are farmers. He has not given up hope that he will find a job that lets him continue his passion for service while providing a decent income. ?I would be killing myself if I did something else,? he said. ?It would deplete my energy. When you work on the things you most love doing, it?s not work. ?"
18445,"Maggie Haberman, Jonathan Weisman and Eric Lichtblau",11/02/2017,2017,2,politics,"? President Trump, Japan?s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, and their wives will fly to    in Palm Beach, Fla. for dinner and a weekend of golf. ? Treasury   Steven Mnuchin?s confirmation vote, originally slated for a rare Saturday session in the Senate, has been pushed to Monday. Mr. Trump overruled his newly minted secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, and rejected the secretary?s choice for his deputy at the department, two people briefed on the decision said Friday. The deputy?s job was denied for Elliott Abrams, a conservative who had served under President Ronald Reagan and President George W. Bush, deals a blow to Mr. Tillerson in his first week on the job. The rejection of Mr. Abrams leaves Mr. Tillerson without a sherpa to help guide the   government official around the State Department headquarters. Mr. Trump had a productive meeting with Mr. Abrams on Tuesday, according to a White House official and a person close to Mr. Abrams. But after it took place, Mr. Trump learned of Mr. Abrams?s pointed criticisms of the president when he was running for president, the administration official said. Among those criticisms was a column headlined ?When You Can?t Stand Your Candidate,? which appeared in May 2016 in The Weekly Standard. Mr. Trump has been increasingly focused on who was with him or against him during his campaign, according to several people who have spoken with him in recent days. Mr. Tillerson had argued strongly for Mr. Abrams. So had Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump?s    and a senior adviser. Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas who is closely aligned with friends of Mr. Abrams? and some members of the   lobbying group Aipac, had been reaching out to Democratic senators to impress upon them the importance of Mr. Abrams receiving Senate confirmation. Aides to Mr. Trump did not respond to an email seeking comment. The revelation that Michael T. Flynn, President Trump?s national security adviser, apparently discussed sanctions with Russia?s ambassador to the United States in the weeks before the inauguration has given Democrats a new cudgel to revive discussions of Mr. Trump?s ties to Russian President Vladimir V. Putin. And they are swinging it. Representative Eric Swalwell of California, the ranking Democrat on the C. I. A. subcommittee of the House Intelligence Committee, called it ?a crime for someone outside of our government to negotiate with foreign entities on our nation?s behalf. ? Senators Christopher S. Murphy of Connecticut and Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, both Democrats, were similarly scathing in a joint statement. Said Mr. Murphy: With the legal fight over President Trump?s travel ban apparently headed for the Supreme Court, a leading contender for the job of arguing the government?s cases before the highest court has dropped out of consideration. The candidate, Charles J. Cooper, said he was withdrawing as a possible nominee for solicitor general of the United States ?after witnessing the treatment of my friend Jeff Sessions,? who was approved as attorney general Wednesday evening after bruising attacks by Senate Democrats over his civil rights record. Mr. Cooper, a conservative Washington lawyer who argued against gay marriage in an important California case, said that after what Mr. Sessions ?had to endure at the hands of a partisan opposition that will say anything and do anything to advance their political interests, I am unwilling to subject myself, my family, and my friends to such a process. ? His withdrawal appears to leave George T. Conway, a New York lawyer who is married to Kellyanne Conway, a top White House aide, as the leading contender for solicitor general. Mr. Trump said Thursday that he expected to select a new nominee in about a week. Whoever gets confirmed for the job could end up arguing the legality of Mr. Trump?s travel ban before the Supreme Court. No wonder Mr. Trump wants the Mexicans to pay for it. The wall on the southern border  ?   really a set of fences and walls  ?   would take three and a half years to build and would cost $21. 6 billion, according to an internal report by the Department of Homeland Security that was seen by Reuters. That?s well over the $12 billion estimated by Mr. Trump during the campaign, and the upper bound of $15 billion cited by Republican leaders in Congress. At a time when federal deficits are again expected to grow, the amount is not pocket change. As the population ages and draws on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, the Congressional Budget Office is already expecting the government to heap nearly $10 trillion onto the federal debt over the coming decade  ?   and that is with statutory caps on domestic and military spending. Mr. Trump has already vowed to bust through those caps on the military side of the ledger, something that would take an act of Congress. Now he?ll have to pay extra for his promised wall  ?   either out of existing domestic programs or above the nondefense caps. Mr. Trump is still pretty miffed that a   panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously upheld a restraining order against his travel ban from seven   countries. We can also deduce what he was watching on television: MSNBC?s Morning Joe. Wonder why it took 12 minutes to compose that post on Twitter. On Thursday night, The New York Times published a scoop: the president of the United States had not spoken to the president of China, Xi Jinping, who was icing him out over his unorthodox call with the leader of Taiwan during his transition to power, and his suggestion that just maybe, Washington would no longer follow the ?One China? policy (which affirms that Taiwan is a province of the mainland). Hours later, the White House issued a statement that, hey, not only had Mr. Trump just spoken to Mr. Xi, he had also expressed support for the One China policy after all  ?   something Mr. Trump had said he would do only in return for concessions. The Times story was rewritten accordingly, capturing the news. But Mr. Trump does not accept the chronology  ?   at least not publicly. Hillary Clinton has been slow to emerge after her November defeat. But there she was on social media Thursday night, praising the unanimous decision by a   panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to uphold a nationwide restraining order against Mr. Trump?s travel ban for seven   countries. To which Kellyanne Conway, the Trump     House adviser, had a reply. Winning is everything. First came the video of Representative Mike Coffman of Colorado sneaking out a back door to avoid the angry crowd gathered for his town hall meeting  ?   but his suburban Denver district is swingy. Then Representative Tom McClintock of California had to flee under guard as constituents in Roseville demanded to know why he was so bent on repealing the Affordable Care Act. But hey, it?s California  ?   even though his turf outside Sacramento isn?t exactly Berkeley. But Utah? On Wednesday, it was Representative Jason Chaffetz?s turn  ?   in the reddest of states, in the Salt Lake City suburb Cottonwood Heights. It?s getting ugly out there."
17434,Zach Wichter,14/02/2017,2017,2,entertainment,"You have probably heard it yourself: the impression that millennials are financial freewheelers. The theory goes that today?s   or   spend with little regard for savings and even less regard for retiring. Retirement planning experts say that this assumption isn?t entirely accurate  ?   though it is perennially true that most young adults don?t make retirement savings a financial priority. But, as the experts point out, millennials are in an ideal position to get started, because whatever they set aside will grow and accrue interest greatly over time. ?The value of compounding means you?ll have to contribute less later,? said Maria Bruno, a senior investment strategist at Vanguard, the investment management company. She recommends that people open retirement accounts as early as they can  ?   that way, the savings have more time to build and be reinvested. Eventually, the interest an account accrues will begin to earn interest of its own. The New York Times spoke to five people in the   to    age group, a small sample of millennial savers. Two experts from the retirement division of Prudential Financial offered advice and feedback on each person?s profile. Though advice differed based on the individual situation, advisers across the spectrum were consistent on two broader points: ? Young investors should take advantage of Roth retirement fund options. Roth funds, which include individual retirement accounts and 401( k)?s, differ from traditional retirement accounts in that contributions are made after tax once money is invested, earnings and withdrawals are  . ? Younger workers should contribute at least as much as an employer is willing to match in a 401( k) or similar program. With this advice in mind, read a snapshot of millennials at various stages of retirement planning. Mr. LaCasse doesn?t see himself jetting off to exotic destinations at the end of his career, but he does hope to have some financial security and independence. He makes about $52, 000 a year and contributes 4 percent of every paycheck to a 403( b) account  ?   a retirement account primarily for teachers. His school does not match his contributions, but he did receive an initial,   contribution of $1, 200. He currently has about $6, 000 in a savings account he doesn?t touch, and he puts away a little from every paycheck. Though he would like to save more, Mr. LaCasse worries that he is not in a secure enough position to do so. ?There?s kind of a feeling of short term versus long term, and unfortunately the short term comes first  ?   I need to cover my    expenses,? he said. ?The long term takes a major back seat. ? For one thing, student loan repayments (of nearly $500 a month) represent about a fifth of his monthly expenses and hinder his ability to squirrel away more.  THE ADVICE Stephanie Sherman, a certified financial planner at Prudential, said that Mr. LaCasse might be able to restructure his student loans to give himself more breathing room. ?If he has a great credit score, he can refinance them and make the same payment and pay them off quicker, or free up more money for savings,? she said. Mr. LaCasse said he had already considered refinancing and was thinking about it more seriously after hearing Ms. Sherman?s advice. ?The process seems so daunting, and it keeps getting pushed aside,? he said. ?Now I feel more motivated to do it. ? If she is able to break into theater or film, Ms. Craven would like to keep working for a lifetime. ?As an actor, I?m going to want to tell stories and do that as long as I can,? she said. Even so, she hopes by her late 60s or early 70s to prioritize family time and traveling. Though she has never had a job with retirement benefits, she would be comfortable putting aside 5 to 10 percent of her $45, 000 income on her own. She already has $7, 500 in savings, but not in a formal retirement account. Her main concern is seasonal fluctuations in her salary that could derail a   savings plan. ?I?m in a very busy season for work right now, so I?m making more money, but once the tourists go away, it?ll be back to scraping by,? Ms. Craven said. THE ADVICE Ms. Craven said she felt she wasn?t doing enough to save for retirement, but the experts saw things differently. ?Mollie sounds like she has it all together,? Ms. Sherman said, noting how much she already has in savings. She didn?t deny that seasonal income fluctuations were a challenge, but said that there were many ways to plan around them. She suggested that Ms. Craven find a financial adviser to develop a personalized strategy and perhaps open an independent retirement account. Ms. Sherman also explained that many people in the entertainment field built retirement benefit credits through organizations that they worked for, but that these benefits were not always well advertised to contractors. Ms. Craven said that she was fairly certain she had not accrued retirement credits through her performances, but was interested in finding an adviser and considering a formal retirement account. ?It does seem disheartening that the savings account that I have just sits there and doesn?t grow hardly at all, maybe a cent every month or so,? she said. ?I?d love to put some of that away and not touch it. ? Although he has worked at his current company, Redwood Logistics, for more than three years, Mr. Ruger has been hesitant to invest in its 401( k). ?It?s such a millennial thing, but I don?t want to have to commit to a job,? he said. His career goal is to wind up on Broadway. And while he does some singing gigs on the side, the older he gets, the less likely he figures he is to start a   acting career. He doesn?t have a definite vision for his retirement, either. ?If I?m being totally honest, I never saw myself as having that option,? Mr. Ruger said. He has a few thousand dollars in a checking account, but no specific savings. He also has a lot of college debt. ?We?re paying off these crazy student loans with these crazy interest rates,? Mr. Ruger said. ?Stuff that requires money  ?   like houses and cars and retirement  ?   are not in the cards. We can just pay off the interest on our student loans and our rent, and work until we die. ? Further on the topic of his company?s 401( k) Mr. Ruger said he was unsure how the plan worked and worried about losing his investment if he ever left the job. THE ADVICE Crystal Vacura, a retirement counselor at Prudential, said that Mr. Ruger?s feelings were not uncommon: Many people are hesitant to invest in a 401( k) for reasons like procrastination or confusion. She pointed out to Mr. Ruger that 401( k) contributions could usually stay invested in the original fund or could roll over into new accounts if he switched employers or went freelance. She also suggested that Mr. Ruger put aside all of the earnings from his singing gigs into a dedicated savings account: If he is really not comfortable with a   401( k) he should consider opening an I. R. A. she said. Mr. Ruger particularly liked Mrs. Vacura?s suggestion of investing the money he earned from singing, and said that if he had to choose between a 401( k) and an I. R. A. ?I?d go with getting my act together and opening a retirement account through my job, because they offer one, and it?s ridiculous that I haven?t done that yet. ? As a state employee, Ms. King is eligible to invest in the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System, and she anticipates staying with her employer for the duration. ?I hope to retire at some point  ?   my expectation is, after 30 years of service,? she said. ?Because I am working for a public institution, 30 years is pretty much the standard. ? She has been in her current role for only three years, but was able to start contributing to Opers (the acronym for the Ohio retirement system) as a student employee and already has $15, 000 in her account. Though she has no other formal savings, Ms. King owns a house and contributes 10 percent of her $   salary to the account, with the university contributing an additional 14 percent. Ms. King is paying off student loans but expects to be   by the end of the winter, at which point she will be able to diversify her savings plan and increase her contributions by as much as 25 or 50 percent. THE ADVICE ?Cherita certainly seems   on paying off her student loans,? Ms. Sherman said. ?She also seems very focused on redirecting that to increasing her retirement savings. ? Ms. Sherman and Ms. Vacura agreed that Ms. King was in a good position for retirement, though they recommended that she open a separate ?rainy day? savings account. Ms. King said the rainy day fund was her next priority after paying off her student loans. And she was happy her efforts had won good reviews. ?It?s validating to hear that people who know about finance are saying I?m on the right track,? she said. Ms. Hamilton has been planning for her retirement since she was 17. ?I took a class in high school, and they showed me the building of compounding interest,? she said. That prompted her to get a weekend job and put her earnings into an I. R. A. which has grown to about $30, 000. She also has a separate 401( k) through her employer, with a similar amount invested. ?I want to work really hard now and save really hard so I can travel the world and not have to worry about finances? in retirement, Ms. Hamilton said. Her husband is a strong partner in her savings plan. When they married last year, they agreed to live on a single income and put the rest into savings: They already have more than $100, 000. Ms. Hamilton is very reluctant to touch her primary income for anything beyond basic necessities. When the time came to buy new furniture, she got a weekend job at Restoration Hardware to cover the expense. THE ADVICE Ms. Sherman of Prudential said that while Ms. Hamilton would seem to be a model of thrift, she could be even more proactive, perhaps by buying life insurance or opening a   retirement savings plan. ?Really start to address the things that could derail your retirement, as you?re a fabulous saver,? she suggested. Ms. Hamilton said that her personal financial adviser gave similar feedback and that she was encouraged to be receiving such consistent advice about reaching her goals. ?I may not make a million dollars a year, but I feel like I can one day hopefully have a retirement that?s comparable,? she said."
17311,Carl Hulse,3/01/2017,2017,1,business,"WASHINGTON  ?   It?s   or   time for Republicans. After a tumultuous decade that has seen profound changes in the makeup and character of their party, Republicans are poised to complete their slow but steady climb back to power as they seize control of the House, Senate and the White House for the first time since 2006. That political triad will leave them with a splendid opportunity for success. But there is little room for failure if they hope to satisfy their impatient constituents and deliver on bold promises to reshape the nation?s health care delivery system, restructure the tax code, drive job creation, muscle up American foreign policy, rebuild a crumbling infrastructure and set America on a new course. Republicans who will take command of the Senate and House as the 115th Congress convenes on Tuesday have long been itching for a chance to do it their way, constantly grousing that President Obama and Congressional Democrats held back American progress and economic growth. Now they must show they can deliver. And they know it. ?When you have both houses and the presidency, there is no acceptable excuse for not passing major legislation,? said Representative Tom Cole, a senior Republican from Oklahoma. ?There is a lot of pressure on Republican members to produce and to produce quickly. ? That will not be easy. There is a mutual wariness between many Republicans in Congress and   Donald J. Trump, leaving it unclear how often their interests and priorities will coalesce or collide. Some of the biggest fights might well be between Republicans on Capitol Hill and the White House occupied by a man who campaigned against the establishment and some of the very Republicans running Congress. Republicans must also maneuver while facing slightly expanded Democratic minorities in the House and Senate, in a climate that is, in many respects, even more hostile than it was before the November elections. Democrats remain angry at how Republicans treated President Obama, including their refusal to consider the nomination of federal Judge Merrick B. Garland to the United States Supreme Court. Democrats want payback for the cold shoulder given to Mr. Garland?s nomination to satisfy themselves and to show their supporters that they are not going to roll over for the new Republican government. While they cannot employ the filibuster to block most nominations, they still retain it for Supreme Court picks and legislation  ?   at least for now. Perhaps most important, Republicans themselves are going to need something of an attitude adjustment. The contemporary Republican Party has been built out of fierce opposition to Mr. Obama and deep disdain for activist government. Nearly   of current House Republicans have never served with a Republican president and their entire time in Washington has been spent fighting the executive branch. As a result, Republicans have had the luxury of being able to argue for positions that appealed to their conservative base but that they knew would not become law because Senate Democrats would block them or because the president would veto them. Now, if they can assemble the votes, their ideas will become law  ?   with all the attendant consequences. Republicans who have shied from the responsibility of government will now be called upon to support increases in the debt limit, approve annual budgets, endorse spending bills and back other   measures that they formerly left to the Democrats and some of their more compromising colleagues. With Democrats unlikely to help on many of those votes after being castigated for them by Republicans, the Republicans who belonged to the ?vote no, hope yes? caucus when it came to critical legislation in recent years now will have to vote yes and hope things go well. This isn?t the same style of Republican majority pushed from power after being routed in the 2006 midterm elections after the public backlash to the administration of President George W. Bush and his handling of the war in Iraq. Forged by the Tea Party revolt that restored Republicans to control of the House in the 2010 elections, and in the Senate in 2014, this party is much more conservative with a membership that tends to see government as an impediment to be leveled, not as a force to be shaped to their views to the benefit of their constituents. Eight years of railing against the Obama administration has infused them and their constituents with a hostility and disregard for the government that Republicans must now lead rather than ridicule. Tensions could arise between House and Senate Republicans as well. When the Newt   party took over the House in 1995 for the first time in four decades, newly empowered Republicans sent a raft of legislation to the Senate, only to see it stall there. With President Bill Clinton in the White House at the time, Republicans knew much of it would not be enacted. Now, with Mr. Trump soon to occupy the Oval Office, it is unlikely that House Republicans will be willing to watch Democrats bottle up legislation in the Senate. Demands that their Senate counterparts eliminate the filibuster could mount quickly. While they understand the challenges, Republicans are nonetheless jubilant at their enviable position. ?A Republican in the White House and a Republican majority in Congress present tremendous opportunity to make real progress,? Senator Cory Gardner, Republican of Colorado, said in the party?s weekly radio address on Saturday. ?We assume that responsibility with the promise that we?ll work hard to do everything that we can to deliver more opportunities to Americans tomorrow than they have today. ? ?I am pretty giddy,? said Mr. Cole as he looked ahead. Republicans have won their chance. Now it is time to see what they can do with it."
17600,Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Frances Robles,13/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"WASHINGTON  ?   President Obama said Thursday that he was terminating the    policy that has allowed Cubans who arrived on United States soil without visas to remain in the country and gain legal residency, an unexpected move long sought by the Cuban government. ?Effective immediately, Cuban nationals who attempt to enter the United States illegally and do not qualify for humanitarian relief will be subject to removal, consistent with U. S. law and enforcement priorities,? Mr. Obama said in a statement. ?By taking this step, we are treating Cuban migrants the same way we treat migrants from other countries. ? The move places a finishing touch on Mr. Obama?s efforts as president to end a   of hostility between the United States and Cuba and to establish normalized relations and diplomatic ties with a government American presidents have long sought to isolate and punish. The action came through a new Department of Homeland Security regulation and a deal with the Cuban government, which Mr. Obama said had agreed to accept the return of its citizens. ?What we?ve agreed to is that the past is past, and the future will be different,? said Jeh Johnson, the Homeland Security secretary. ?This is us repealing a policy unique to Cuba given the nature of the relationship 20 years ago, which is very different right now. ? The   ?wet foot, dry foot? policy, which dates to 1995, owes its name to its unusual rules, which require Cubans caught trying to reach the United States by sea to return home, yet allow those who make it onto American soil to stay and eventually apply for legal, permanent residency. It was one way in which the United States tried to weaken Fidel Castro?s government, by welcoming tens of thousands of Cubans fleeing repression. In recent years, however, it has become a magnet for economic refugees, enticing many Cubans to make a perilous journey to the United States, where they enjoy a status unlike migrants from any other country. ?The exceptionalism of the ?wet foot, dry foot? policy toward Cuba is a relic of the Cold War, and this decision by the administration is really its final effort to normalize an area of interaction between Cuba and the United States, migration, that is clearly in need of normalization,? said Peter Kornbluh, a   of ?Back Channel to Cuba,? which recounts the secret negotiations between the United States and Cuban governments that forged the policy. But the change drew sharp criticism from opponents of Mr. Obama?s move to thaw United States relations with Cuba, who argued it would reward dictators in Cuba, ignoring their human rights abuses. ?Today?s announcement will only serve to tighten the noose the Castro regime continues to have around the neck of its own people,? Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, said in a statement. He said Congress had not been consulted on the move, and he added, ?The Obama administration seeks to pursue engagement with the Castro regime at the cost of ignoring the present state of torture and oppression, and its systematic curtailment of freedom. ? Benjamin J. Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser, who led clandestine negotiations that produced the 2014 opening, said most Cubans who came to the United States in the past ?absolutely had to leave? Cuba ?for political purposes. ? Now, he said, the flow is largely of people seeking greater economic opportunity. Ending the policy, he added, is a reflection of Mr. Obama?s view that, ultimately, the rise of a new generation of Cubans pressing for change in their own country is vital to bringing about change there. ?It?s important that Cuba continue to have a young, dynamic population that are agents of change,? Mr. Rhodes said. Jorge Mas, the chairman of the Cuban American National Foundation, said the changes would force Cuba?s leaders to be more responsive to their citizens. ?People may be initially upset at not being able to have this way of getting out of Cuba, but ultimately, the solution for Cuba is people fighting for change in Cuba,? Mr. Mas said. The change in policy essentially guts the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966, which assumed that Cubans were political refugees who needed protection and allowed those who remained in the United States for more than a year to become legal residents. Obama administration officials urged Congress on Thursday to repeal the measure, but in the interim, by eliminating the policy that automatically afforded parole to Cubans arriving in the United States, they have essentially denied Cuban migrants the opportunity to take advantage of its benefits. Cuba, likewise, still has a law in place that denies   to migrants once they have been gone for four years or more Mr. Rhodes said officials in Havana have pledged to repeal it once the United States Congress scraps the Cuban Adjustment Act. Cubans who believe they will be persecuted if they return home will still be permitted to apply for political asylum when they reach the United States. According to the agreement, which was signed on Thursday in Havana, the Cuban government said it would accept 2, 746 people who fled in the Mariel boatlift of 1980 back into the country, and consider accepting back others on a    basis. The Obama administration also eliminated the Cuban Medical Parole program, in which Cuban medical professionals stationed in international missions could defect and get   visas to the United States. Obama administration officials had initially said they were not planning to change the policy after efforts to normalize relations with Cuba. But the thaw prompted speculation that once diplomatic relations resumed  ?   as they did in 2015  ?   the arrangement would end. On Thursday, the officials said they had deliberately played down talk of revising the policy for fear of setting off an even larger exodus from the island nation. The number of Cubans trying to arrive by sea surged after the United States and Cuba announced the decision to restore diplomatic relations in 2014. In the 2014 fiscal year, almost 4, 000 Cubans either landed or were caught. Two years later, the number shot up to 7, 411, according to the Coast Guard. The number of Cubans who have since begun to arrive in the United States by land has also soared in recent years. The number of Cubans who arrived at the Southwest border has increased more than fivefold since 2009. Last year, almost 55, 000 Cubans arrived nationwide, the Department of Homeland Security said. Kevin Appleby of the Center for Migration Studies of New York praised the specific change, while questioning the broader rules covering asylum. ?The good news is that it ensures equal treatment between Cubans and   from other nations,? he said. ?The bad news is that our asylum system is broken and does not afford adequate due process and protection to those who need it. ? Phil Peters, president of the Cuba Research Center, said that the number of Cubans entering the United States is actually much higher because tens of thousands more overstay their visitor visas and still others migrate legally. ?This is a favor to Trump because it?s a tough measure to take, but it?s the right measure to take,? Mr. Peters said. ?These are economic migrants coming here that, unlike any other nationality, get a big package of government benefits without any justification. ? There was a mixed reaction among Cubans in Havana to news of the sudden change in policy. Some said they felt its repeal was long overdue. Others thought the impact would be widely felt among Cubans still hoping to leave their island. Michel, 33, who declined to give his last name for fear of running afoul of the government, said he tried to escape on a makeshift boat in the early 2000s, but the vessel broke down halfway to the Florida Keys. Since then, he has given up on his desire to move to the United States. But he knows many Cubans who still hope to leave and who would be devastated by the change in policy. ?This is going to make a lot of people?s lives very hard,? he said. Alberto Herrero, 58, a high school biology teacher, applauded the move by the Obama administration, saying the previous regulation was ?an unfair law. It?s unfair to the rest of the world?s people, especially those in Latin America. ? ?It?s exclusive to us, and that?s not fair to the world,? he said, adding that he hoped the removal of the policy was a signal of a   of other outdated measures taken by the Americans against Cuba. ?Maybe other restrictions will be lifted, like the embargo,? he added."
17573,Mujib Mashal and Taimoor Shah,12/01/2017,2017,1,crime,"KABUL, Afghanistan  ?   Abdul Ali Shamsi had already covered a lot of ground before he moved to Kandahar Province to become deputy governor a year and a half ago. Mr. Shamsi was at the vanguard of a new generation of Afghan leaders. From an early job as a security guard in Kabul, he became a security expert in Helmand Province and moved up in the provincial government there. And he helped found the Afghanistan 1400 youth political movement, starting public campaigns to console victims of violence around the country and to raise support for Afghan governance. ?These efforts have two impacts: One is we stand up against things we believe are wrong, but the other more important factor is we project courage,? he told The Guardian newspaper a few years ago, as he was spearheading an effort to clean up and reopen a lakeside picnic spot in Kabul after a Taliban attack. ?We enable people to stand up against violence, people who in many ways have been passive because of fears instilled among the population. ? On Tuesday, Mr. Shamsi, 38, became a victim of the kind of violence he had helped others withstand, killed along with 10 other people when explosives placed within the Kandahar governor?s guesthouse detonated during a reception for visiting Arab officials. He was the third Kandahar deputy governor to be killed in the line of duty in just a few years, and he knew, in taking the job, that he would be just as much a target as his two predecessors  ?   one a young poet and writer who was gunned down in a university classroom and, before that, an engineer who was killed by a suicide bomber on his way to work. The attack in Kandahar this week seemed expressly aimed at breaking down the cause that Mr. Shamsi and his colleagues were dedicated to: trying to restore faith in government after years of devastating war and disappointing failures. Among the dead were an Afghan senator and a member of Parliament, five officials from the United Arab Emirates and an Afghan envoy to the United States, according to officials. Eighteen others were wounded. The governor of Kandahar, Humayoon Azizi, and the ambassador of the United Arab Emirates, Juma Mohammed Abdullah   were among the wounded, but their injuries were not considered   said Gen. Abdul Raziq, the security chief of Kandahar Province. The president of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed   said in a statement that the officials were in Kandahar ?to carry out humanitarian, educational and development projects. ? He ordered flags to be flown at   for three days of mourning in his country. The explosions in Kandahar capped a bloody day in Afghanistan. A bombing targeted a meeting of militia commanders in the Helmand provincial capital, Lashkar Gah, killing from seven to 11 people, according to various Afghan officials. Hours later, a double bombing that was claimed by the Taliban killed at least 38 people and wounded 86 others outside the Parliament during the early evening rush hour. Even by the standards of Kandahar, which has a long history of officials and elders being targeted in complex attacks over the years, the extent of the security breach raised questions. To get to the governor?s guesthouse requires passing through multiple security checks, and measures were so tight on Tuesday before the dignitaries? visit that, according to one official, Mr. Shamsi?s own car was even searched. General Raziq said that an intense investigation into the attack was starting, and that the national security adviser was coming to Kandahar to lead the effort. In an interview, the police commander said the guesthouse had been under construction for months, with about three dozen workers coming to the site each day, raising the possibility that explosives could have been smuggled in that way. ?We have detained several people who were working there, and they are under investigation,? General Raziq said. The general, who  has survived dozens of attacks himself, barely escaped this one. He said he had walked out of the hall to offer his evening prayers in the next room when the explosives went off. ?I wasn?t finished with my prayers when the loud explosion occurred,? General Raziq said. ?It shook the whole building, blew out the windows, and the entire hall was in flames that were out of control. ? Many of the bodies were burned beyond recognition, Afghan officials said. And despite the government?s formally declaring Mr. Shamsi among the dead, his brother, Fazal Bari Shamsi, said the family had yet to receive the body, which was awaiting DNA testing for identification. On Wednesday, tributes poured in after it was confirmed that Mr. Shamsi was among the dead. President Ashraf Ghani was described as openly grieving, remaining solemn through his morning meeting with aides and describing Mr. Shamsi?s death as a profound loss for the country. ?This unfortunate and poor nation had such need for you,? wrote Baryalai Helmand in a Facebook post about Mr. Shamsi. ?The martyrdom of youth like you breaks our back. ? Shaharzad Akbar, who was one of the founding members of Afghanistan 1400 along with Mr. Shamsi, posted another emotional tribute. ?He always gave us morale  ?   in the hardest days he was hopeful, and in the darkest moments patriotic,? Ms. Akbar wrote. ?He was more experienced than most of us. With me, a much younger girl with much less experience, he would interact with such respect that it would put me to shame. ? The political group found itself developing a side specialty in trying to rebuild after violence. When a gruesome massacre took place in western Farah Province, Mr. Shamsi was among the group of young leaders who traveled to the province to console the residents of the shaken city. As the most experienced of the lot, having dealt with death and violence during his years in Helmand and the American troop surge, he often took the lead in those kinds of delegations. One of Mr. Shamsi?s first acts on the job the day he became deputy governor in August 2015 was to visit the elderly father of his assassinated predecessor, Abdul Qadeem Patyal, to pay his respects. Dawa Khan Meenapal, then the provincial director of culture in Kandahar and currently a deputy spokesman for Mr. Ghani, was with him. ?It was the atmosphere of a funeral, especially after Patyal?s children came to the room,? Mr. Meenapal said about the visit. ?The two deputy governors before him had been martyred. Shamsi knew that working in Kandahar meant being mentally prepared for that. ?"
18363,Thomas Erdbrink,8/02/2017,2017,2,lifestyle,"TEHRAN  ?   With Iran calibrating how to deal with President Trump, its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, caustically thanked the new American leader on Tuesday for revealing ?the true face? of the United States. ?We are thankful to this newcomer,? Ayatollah Khamenei told Iranian Air Force commanders, according to a report posted on his official website. Iranian officials had been showing caution since Mr. Trump took office last month. Despite expressing anger at his policies and comments, even   have taken care not to provoke the new American president. But on Tuesday, it became seemingly apparent to Iran?s leaders that Mr. Trump is not easily ignored. After Ayatollah Khamenei spoke out sarcastically about Mr. Trump, others expressed worries. Iran?s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said in an interview with a local newspaper that he expected ?difficult times ahead? for Iran, now that Mr. Trump was in charge. Iran?s president, Hassan Rouhani, defended the nuclear agreement between his country and six world powers, including the United States, by saying that the deal was ? ? for all. But Mr. Trump  ?   who has described the nuclear agreement as ?really, really bad? but has not made any moves to alter it  ?   disparaged Iran again on Twitter, this time in a defense against criticism that he is too close to Russia and its leader, President Vladimir V. Putin. Mr. Trump wondered how President Barack Obama could have made a nuclear agreement with Iran, a country Mr. Trump described as ?#1 in terror. ? Mr. Trump seemed to be summarizing comments by his defense secretary, Jim Mattis, who on Sunday called Iran the ?biggest sponsor of state terrorism. ? Many Iranians have expressed astonishment and ridicule at such assertions, pointing to terrorist groups that despise Iran and the West. First Al Qaeda, responsible for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and more recently the Islamic State, which has been killing thousands in the Middle East and is responsible for committing and inspiring attacks in Europe and the United States. ?Trump is trying to corner Iran, to make us bow before the U. S. and change our behavior, or face confrontation,? said Nader Karimi Joni, a political activist close to Mr. Rouhani?s government. Mr. Trump included Iran on  a list of seven predominantly Muslim countries whose citizens have been barred from entering the United States under an executive order that has been blocked, for now, in the American court system. Mr. Trump?s national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, warned Tehran last week that it had been put ?on notice? after an Iranian missile test. Washington imposed new economic sanctions on 25 people and entities after the missile launch, which Mr. Flynn said had violated a 2015 United Nations Security Council resolution approved after the United States and other world powers reached an agreement with Iran on its nuclear program. Iran has asserted that its missile tests do not violate that resolution and fall within its rights to  . In another possible move against Iran, Mr. Trump?s advisers are debating an order intended to designate its Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps as a foreign terrorist organization, according to current and former officials in the United States briefed on the deliberations. For Ayatollah Khamenei, Mr. Trump?s ascent appears to have vindicated many suspicions harbored by the Iranian leader, who has said many times that the United States cannot be trusted. ?He has proven what we have been saying for more than 30 years  ?   we would always speak about the political, economic, moral and social corruption in the U. S. administration  ?   this man revealed it during the election campaign and since then,? Ayatollah Khamenei said, according to a translated text of the speech. Hamidreza Taraghi, a political analyst close to Iran?s leaders, said Mr. Trump?s ?threatening and ranting? style reflected a miscalculation of Iran?s power. ?He will soon realize Iran will not be intimidated,? Mr. Taraghi said. The history of animosity between both countries is long and deep. Several American administrations, including Mr. Obama?s, have argued for years that Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism, because of its support for the Lebanese Hezbollah movement and the Palestinian groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad, which the United States regards as terrorist organizations. Iran has also been held responsible by the United States for several terror attacks, most decades ago. One of them, of course, was the seizure of 54 members of the American Embassy staff in Tehran for 444 days during the Islamic Revolution in 1979. Iran also has been accused of involvement in a 1983 bomb attack at a Marines barracks in Lebanon, where 241 service personnel died. In 2003, a federal judge ruled that Hezbollah carried out the attack at the behest of Iran. Several judges have ordered Iran to pay billions of dollars in damages. Iran denies the accusations. Iran has pressed several claims against the United States. Iran holds the United States responsible for having supported Saddam Hussein with intelligence, funds and weapons after he attacked Iran in 1980, dragging both countries into a   war where thousands of Iranians and Iraqis died. In 1988, an American naval vessel, the Vincennes, shot down an Iran Air commercial plane, flying over the Persian Gulf to Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates. All 290 people aboard died. Iran called the attack deliberate and the United States called it a mistake. Under a settlement at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, the United States offered no apologies and was ordered to pay around $60 million in damages to families of the victims. Some of Mr. Trump?s top aides apparently view Iran and its clerical leaders as a leading source of evil. During his inaugural speech, Mr. Trump vowed to ?unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate from the face of the Earth. ? At the time, many thought he meant the Islamic State, but in books and speeches both Mr. Flynn and Mr. Mattis said Iran was radically Islamic and described the country as the biggest threat to peace in the Middle East. In a Twitter post on Friday, Mr. Trump said: ?Iran is playing with fire  ?   they don?t appreciate how ?kind? President Obama was to them. Not me!? Ayatollah Khamenei responded to Mr. Trump?s Friday posting in biting fashion with his own remarks on Twitter. ?Iran should?ve appreciated Obama!? he wrote, adding, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State: ?How come? Appreciate him for #DAESH, war in Iraq Syria or public support for 2009 unrest?? In a   post, he said that Iranians would hold a rally on Friday, the 38th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution, to show ?their position toward threats. ?"
18118,Dave Itzkoff,3/02/2017,2017,2,politics,"The annual custom of the White House Correspondents? Association dinner suddenly seems uncomfortable if not untenable: Journalists mingling with Trump administration aides who loathe them, celebrities decrying Trump White House policies, and an entertainment headliner grappling with the tone and boldness of jokes about President Trump himself. But Samantha Bee is not waiting to see how this year?s soiree unfolds or if those involved decide to hold it at all. Instead, Ms. Bee, host of the topical TBS comedy show ?Full Frontal With Samantha Bee,? and her colleagues are planning a   that will take place in Washington on April 29, the same night as the Correspondents? Association dinner. This alternative gala, which is being called ?Not the White House Correspondents? Dinner? and was announced on Monday, will be at the Willard Hotel. Ms. Bee said that it was not an attempt to comment on or compete with that other,   banquet, but a night to include jokes about Mr. Trump that she and   comedians want to make. ?We?re not trying to supersede it,? she said in a telephone interview. ?We just want to be there in case something happens  ?   or doesn?t happen  ?   and ensure that we get to properly roast the president. ? Ms. Bee said that she and her ?Full Frontal? producers got the idea for their event after Mr. Trump?s election in November. ?We were talking out loud about whether we thought the White House Correspondents? dinner would change during a Trump presidency, or if it would even exist,? she said. ?And then we thought, Why don?t we just do one, just to do it in the way that we would want it done if we were hosting it?? The ?Not the White House Correspondents? Dinner? will probably be shown on TBS in some form Ms. Bee said that those details were still being worked out, as was a lineup of talent. ?We have binders full of people, but we don?t have any specifics to offer yet,? she said. Ms. Bee said that proceeds from her event would go to the Committee to Protect Journalists. The   dinner held by the Correspondents? Association, which advocates press accessibility at the White House and gives out journalism awards and scholarships, has come under scrutiny in recent years. Some news organizations and observers regard it as a   atmosphere for reporters to hobnob with the officials they are supposed to be covering objectively and adversarially. (The New York Times stopped sending journalists to the dinner in 2008.) The event has also been the scene of two notorious incidents. At the 2006 dinner, its featured performer, Stephen Colbert, delivered a scathing satirical takedown of President George W. Bush. Mr. Colbert?s performance, in the guise of the arrogant   political commentator he played on Comedy Central, appeared to offend Mr. Bush and several of his aides, though it was widely celebrated by television and internet viewers. (The next year, the Correspondents? Association invited Rich Little.) In 2011, Mr. Trump, then a civilian and a guest at the dinner, sat   as he was mocked relentlessly by President Obama and Seth Meyers for having promoted the false theory that Mr. Obama was not born in the United States. Mr. Obama said of Mr. Trump at the time: ?Now he can get to focusing on the issues that matter. Like, did we fake the moon landing? What really happened at Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac?? Mr. Trump lashed out the next morning, in an interview with The Times, saying Mr. Meyers had ?no talent? and acknowledging his discomfort  ?   ?I am not looking to laugh along with my enemies?  ?   while also speaking at length about possibly running for the presidency. Given the open hostility that Mr. Trump and his administration have displayed for the news media, some journalists have wondered if the Correspondents? Association dinner is a tradition worth preserving. Would Mr. Trump even attend this year, and what entertainer could make jokes about him without getting underneath his   thin skin? Comedians have only started figuring out how to riff on Mr. Trump as president, and there is a wide gulf between what Trump supporters and detractors think is funny about him. The White House Correspondents? Association ?looks forward to hosting our annual dinner this year as we do every year to celebrate the First Amendment, reward some of the finest reporting of the past year and recognize promising young student journalists,? its president, Jeff Mason, said in a statement. The association has not announced its entertainer for the April dinner, and Ms. Bee said she had no expectation of being asked. ?My assumption is that that invitation is not coming,? she said, ?and I don?t blame them for that at all. ? Addressing the Correspondents? Association, she said: ?I honestly can?t imagine what they?re thinking, but I really wish them well. I think that?s going to be very challenging. Does 3 Doors Down do comedy? I don?t know, maybe they do. ?"
17496,Emily Palmer,9/01/2017,2017,1,entertainment,"He was not her type. He was too old for her. She would never give him her number. And then she did. And he called her. And they fell in love. He called three times a day for a week before she finally answered. Alena Kastsiuk picked up the phone that May morning in 2011 only to yell at him for waking her. ?How about sushi?? he responded. Ms. Kastsiuk, a waitress who had worked other   jobs, had little money for such luxuries. Her refrigerator was empty, so she agreed. The sushi date lasted five and a half hours. Although he was almost twice her age, Ms. Kastsiuk, a film directing major from Belarus struggling to find her way into New York?s film industry, discovered much in common with the Russian pianist across from her. The pianist, Vladimir Spitsberg, had arrived in New York State more than 20 years earlier, worked as a digital media arts instructor at Touro College in Manhattan and played with his band, Gypsy Fun Trio, at a Russian restaurant and piano bar in Midtown Manhattan. ?I fell in love that day,? said Ms. Kastsiuk, now 29. ?And I didn?t even understand love yet. ? They married three weeks later. ?Maybe three and a half weeks,? she said. It was not a marriage of convenience. Neither was a United States citizen. They married for love, but the ceremony was a nightmare. On what was supposed to be her wedding day, Ms. Kastsiuk discovered that the security tag was still attached to her dress. Mr. Spitsberg pulled at it, and yellow paint exploded on her gown. She changed into a sundress, and they hurtled to the Brooklyn clerk?s office with 30 minutes to spare before it closed. But they forgot their rings and had to turn back to retrieve them. They made it back to the clerk?s office just after it closed. Friends were waiting at Uncle Vanya Cafe in Midtown and the party could not be called off, so they put together an impromptu ceremony with a friend splashing them with Cognac and sliding the rings over their fingers. He declared them married. The next morning, they returned to the clerk?s office to marry for real. By 2014, they had created Karma World Productions, a film company, where she handled the editing and videography and he produced the music. Ms. Kastsiuk had noticed signs of her husband?s health problems  ?   his ashen face and frequent sweats  ?   before their marriage. Sometimes he would collapse on her couch, unable to make it home. But he did not tell her about his longtime heart and blood pressure problems. Mr. Spitsberg lost his teaching job in 2014. His band started to play at a different restaurant later that year, leading to further stress. He was asked to advise a film project about Russian immigrants in the United States, but the job fell through. He agreed to compose the film?s score, instead. Depressed, Mr. Spitsberg drank, skipped his heart medication and refused to go to a hospital. Helpless, Ms. Kastsiuk watched as his late hours with the band and heavy drinking took a toll. ?I was fighting for him all the time,? she said. ?But his style of life was taking him away from me. ? On May 13, Ms. Kastsiuk heard her husband calling from the bedroom. ?He was sitting on the bed, white and sweating,? she said. ?Everything was wet. ? She called 911 and waited for help. ?Sit close to me,? he said. When emergency responders arrived, the numbness in his chest had spread to his legs. As Mr. Spitsberg was taken to a hospital, Ms. Kastsiuk followed on a bicycle, calling his cellphone repeatedly on the way. But Mr. Spitsberg, 51, was pronounced dead before she arrived. In the emergency room, she held his hand, not letting go until his fingers turned blue. On a cold December morning, sitting inside a Midtown office, seven months after his death, Ms. Kastsiuk still spoke of him in the present tense. She reflected on a life beginning with their romance. She had come to New York in 2008 at 21, initially on a student visa. With $100 in her pocket, she supported herself as a maid, a waitress and a flower seller. Meeting college students in film school in fall 2010, she produced several small video projects. But Mr. Spitsberg had introduced her to an entirely different New York, with evenings at Samovar, the Midtown restaurant where his band played, drinking vodka and singing Russian songs. She networked with producers, became a business partner with her husband and made films. Without children, the couple got a West Highland white terrier. Returning to their Coney Island apartment on the day he died, she felt trapped, as if still in the moments before his death. Valeriy Zhmud, the friend who led the couple?s unofficial marriage ceremony, joined her with a bottle of Mr. Spitsberg?s favorite pinot noir, and she opened the fridge to find the pork that he had cooked the day before. Overcome, she threw it out. But life outside the apartment continued. The band hired another pianist. The couple?s film company halted operation. Financial trouble, which had been a problem for years, increased after his death. Though she is in the country legally, Ms. Kastsiuk does not have a green card, something she is pursuing now. She received a   payment of $255 from Social Security after her husband?s death. Without his income, she is looking for a roommate to split the cost of her $1, 350 rent. Over the summer, the Jewish Board of Family and Children?s Services, a beneficiary agency of   of New York, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, provided Ms. Kastsiuk with $1, 481 of Neediest funds to cover one month?s rent and electricity. ?I didn?t know what to do,? Ms. Kastsiuk recalled. ?And I didn?t think they?d help me. I?m not Jewish, but that didn?t matter to them. ? The organization has helped with another month?s rent and provided bereavement counseling to help her start over in a city filled with memories of her husband. She takes comfort in walks with their dog. ?He?s the only family I have right now,? she said. ?He looks at me and understands my heart. ?"
18095,Lori Holcomb-Holland,23/01/2017,2017,1,business,"It was as though time had stood still at Latisha Hopewell?s apartment in Lower Manhattan. A colorfully decorated Christmas tree again stood near the entrance of her mostly unadorned apartment. Freshly opened presents for her daughters, Shaun and Shani Bates, were stacked beneath the tree, as the girls sat next to their mother on a large, green sofa in their living room. Two years ago, the setting was the same. Ms. Hopewell had gone back to college a year and a half earlier to set an example for her daughters and to finally secure not another job, she said, but a career. Though she was stretched exhaustingly thin among classes, a   job and parenting, she talked about a renewed dedication to completing a path she had begun nearly 20 years earlier, and how a degree would allow her to provide for her daughters in a way she had always wanted. Now Ms. Hopewell, 37, is ebullient, and full of smiles, hugs and laughs. After spending the last three and a half years studying forensic psychology at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Midtown, it was official: She was a college graduate, the first in her family. ?It feels great,? she said, adding that ?it will feel better once I walk down that aisle. ? She finished her degree in December but is saving the big celebration for after the graduation ceremony later this year. She has already rewarded herself in other ways, though: After her last class, she took a few days off work to spend time with her daughters during their winter break from school and to catch up on   sleep. This milestone has been a long time coming for Ms. Hopewell. She attended Buffalo State College from 1997 to 2001, but left before graduating to get a job to pay off tuition debt. It was meant to be a brief hiatus  ?   until, she said, life happened. She became pregnant with Shaun and then with Shani several years later. There were low points and hardships, including living in a homeless shelter for three years. She has largely raised her daughters on her own. Though she always knew she would find her way back to school, Ms. Hopewell said the motivation she needed came from an unexpected place. ?She started it,? Ms. Hopewell said, pointing at her older daughter, Shaun, who is 13. She would needle her mother when Ms. Hopewell was stumped by Shaun?s homework despite having gone to college. ?I didn?t finish,? Ms. Hopewell recalled telling her daughter. But that line will not work anymore. ?I have no excuses now,? she said. Ms. Hopewell said Shaun had taken on the ?super   role,? picking up the slack to take care of Shani, who is 8, when her mother went back to college. Their days typically began with Shaun waking up her sister and Ms. Hopewell seeing the girls off to school before she headed to John Jay. After her morning classes, Ms. Hopewell said, she would go home to make dinner for her children before leaving for her   job as a medical data clerk. Though friends and family pitched in to help look after her daughters when they could, there were times when she had no choice but to take Shaun and Shani to the library so that she could use a computer to write papers. The family made it work, but some of the pressure was lifted in 2014. After hearing of her struggles, a social worker from Educational Alliance, a beneficiary agency of   of New York, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, helped Ms. Hopewell get a laptop so she could do schoolwork at home. The organization used $1, 525 from the fund to help Ms. Hopewell in 2014, including $500 for the laptop. Despite the challenges, Ms. Hopewell said she never doubted she would graduate. ?There were plenty of nights I cried and asked why I did this to myself,? Ms. Hopewell said. ?But at the end of the day I know it?s beneficial for my family and I want bigger and better things, and I have to do it. ? Among those things is a house in Atlanta and financial security. ?I don?t want my kids to have to worry about anything,? Ms. Hopewell said. ?I want to leave a legacy for my kids when I leave this earth, and living paycheck to paycheck is not going to get it. ? The laptop is still being put to good use. Even Shaun borrows it for her homework when her mother does not need it. Though going back to school meant less time together as a family, Ms. Hopewell said she thought the experience had brought them closer, and they continue to inspire one another. ?It?s quite amazing actually  ?   juggling work and school and us,? Shaun said of her mother?s achievements. ?I?m very proud of her for taking the time to go back to school so she can be a role model for us. ? And her mother?s drive, Shaun said, has been infectious. ?Now that she believes in herself more, she instills that motivation in me more,? Shaun said. The   student said she hoped to study neuroscience at Harvard one day. There is more class time in store for Ms. Hopewell as well. She is looking into graduate programs for social work at several local colleges and hopes to start as early as this fall. The goal is to become a licensed counselor for   adolescents. But for now, the adolescents she is most focused on are the two in her apartment, she said. She hopes they see from her experiences that education is the best way to avoid repeating her struggles. ?This experience showed me that I?m raising   young ladies who can adapt to any situation and make the best of it,? Ms. Hopewell said. ?Their capabilities are endless. ?"
17332,Jennifer Steinhauer and Robert Pear,4/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"WASHINGTON  ?   The   Congress opened the turbulent Trump era in Washington on Tuesday, as the new Senate moved instantly to begin the repeal of President Obama?s signature health care law while the House descended into chaos in an   attempt to gut an independent congressional ethics office. On a day usually reserved for pomp, constitutionally mandated procedure and small children parading around in fancy dresses, Congress instead pitched itself into partisan battles. Speaker Paul D. Ryan easily won   but not before the embarrassment of having his members defy him by voting to eliminate the ethics office, only to then abandon that effort after a flood of criticism from constituents and Twitter messages from   Donald J. Trump that criticized House Republican priorities. It was a rocky start to a period in which Republicans had promised an end to Washington gridlock if they controlled both Congress and the White House. There was intraparty conflict and a sense that Mr. Trump, who ran against the Republican establishment, would continue to be openly critical of his own party at times. As Democrats in both chambers seethed, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, unveiled the legislative language that could decimate the Affordable Care Act before the crocuses start to bloom in the spring, even if any replacement of the law could take years. Budget language released on Tuesday gives House and Senate committees only until Jan. 27 to produce legislation that would eliminate major parts of the health care law. Under arcane budget procedures, that legislation would be protected from a Democratic filibuster and could pass the Senate with a simple majority. And debate will begin on Wednesday, before senators have even moved into their new offices. The dueling over the health law?s fate will pull in both the departing and incoming White House administrations as well. On Wednesday, Mr. Obama will visit with congressional Democrats to plot how to resist the planned repeal, and Mike Pence, the vice   will meet with Republicans to gird them for the fight ahead. While the Senate action showed Republicans on course to keep campaign promises, the House got off to a messy start, brought on by Republicans who had moved largely in secret on Monday to gut a congressional ethics office against Mr. Ryan?s wishes. That provoked an outcry from both Democrats and voters who flooded House offices with angry calls. ?Every   organization is calling my office,? said Representative Pete Sessions, Republican of Texas. ?And we?ve told them: ?Thank you very much. We appreciate your feedback. ?? After a hastily called meeting on Tuesday morning among Republicans, the matter was dropped before it could go to the full House floor for a vote. As the Senate moved to larger legislative matters, the House kerfuffle seemed to cast a shadow over Mr. Ryan, but he tried to brush it off. ?There?s no sense of foreboding in the House today,? Mr. Ryan said after his   ?only the sense of potential. ? The fight over the House rules was already acrimonious thanks to a piece of the package that would impose $2, 500 in fines for filming events on the House floor, a response to Democrats who streamed their overnight   over guns last June using cellphones and video cameras. In the Senate, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. swore in seven new members and all the incumbents who won their races last year, their colleagues looking on cheerfully, as a cold rain pelted the newly refurbished Capitol dome. Members of the House and Senate brought along their families  ?   elderly parents with canes, small children tugging at uncomfortable lacy hems  ?   as well as former senators and other special guests. Former Vice President Dick Cheney accompanied his daughter Liz to her   as a member of the House elected from Wyoming. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York officially became the Democratic leader and quickly warned Republicans that the minority would be vocal, if not operatic, in resisting much of their agenda and many of Mr. Trump?s nominees. ?It is our job to do what?s best for the American people, the middle class and those struggling to get there,? he said. ?If the   proposes legislation on issues like infrastructure, trade and closing the carried interest loophole, for instance, we will work in good faith to perfect and, potentially, enact it. When he doesn?t, we will resist. ? He added, ?If   Trump lets the   members of Congress and his cabinet run the show, if he adopts their timeworn policies  ?   which benefit the elites, the special interests and corporate America, not the working man and woman  ?   his presidency will not succeed. ? On Tuesday, the House also adopted rules clearing the way for legislation to roll back the health care law. The budget blueprint introduced on Tuesday in the Senate is not sent to the president and does not become law, but still clears the way for subsequent legislation that Republicans say will repeal major provisions of the Affordable Care Act. Republicans bypassed the Budget Committee so they could immediately bring the measure to the floor. Such resolutions are normally developed after weeks of work in the Budget Committee. Under the plan, four congressional committees  ?   two in the House and two in the Senate  ?   have until Jan. 27 to develop legislation that will be the vehicle for repealing the health care law. The document does not specify which provisions of the law may be eliminated and which ones may be preserved. Nor does it specify or even suggest how Republicans would replace the Affordable Care Act, which the Obama administration says has provided coverage to some 20 million people who were previously uninsured. Republicans have said they may delay the effective date of a repeal bill, to avoid disrupting coverage for people who have it and to provide time for Republicans to develop alternatives to the 2010 health law. The budget blueprint allows Republicans to use savings from repealing major provisions of that law to help offset the cost of future, unspecified measures to help people obtain coverage. ?Americans face skyrocketing premiums and soaring deductibles,? said Senator Mike Enzi, Republican of Wyoming and chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. ?Insurers are withdrawing from markets across the country, leaving many families with fewer choices and less access to care than they had before  ?   the opposite of what the law promised. ? The American Medical Association urged Congress on Tuesday to explain how it would replace the Affordable Care Act. ?Before any action is taken through reconciliation or other means that would potentially alter coverage, policy makers should lay out for the American people, in reasonable detail, what will replace current policies,? the chief executive of the association, Dr. James L. Madara, said in a letter to congressional leaders. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, who engineered the House passage of the health law in 2010, promised this week that Democrats would be just as aggressive in fighting its repeal. Republicans have said they may delay legislation to replace the health law for several years. Ms. Pelosi said that such a delay would be ?an act of cowardice on the part of Republicans,? and that ?they don?t even have the votes to do it? because they have not agreed on a replacement plan. Democrats also vowed to give Mr. Trump?s cabinet nominees rigorous scrutiny. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the   Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, has written to Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the committee chairman, asking to postpone the first scheduled confirmation hearing, set for next week for Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, whom Mr. Trump has chosen as attorney general."
17833,Julie Turkewitz,22/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"?One of the great weapons of a democracy. ? This was how Harry Belafonte, the performer and civil rights activist, referred to the street march in a recent interview. Mr. Belafonte played a critical role in organizing the 1963 March on Washington, which helped spur the passage of two major civil rights bills. He is also a   of the women?s march set for Saturday. When thousands of women converge on Washington this weekend, they will join a long tradition of rallies in the capital. From the suffrage processions of the early 20th century to the Tea Party rallies of 2009, marches have drawn attention to crucial issues, occasionally resulted in violence and often prompted opposing gatherings. Marian B. Mollin, an associate professor at Virginia Tech who studies the history of social movements, said successful marches had capitalized on symbolism and street theater, attracted a broad coalition and pushed clear policy goals. But the test of a march?s   efficacy, she said, is whether it energizes participants long after they?ve gone home, sustaining them through the less exciting aspects of change. This is what she?ll be watching for in the months after Saturday?s march. ?Are they continuing to be fired up when they get back? Because there is a lot of unfun, unglamorous work to do,? she said. We took a look back at several marches in Washington and how they changed  ?   or didn?t change  ?   history. On March 3, 1913, a    named Inez Milholland slipped on her white kid boots, threw a cape around her shoulders and climbed onto a borrowed horse to help lead what was then the largest women?s march in American history. Behind her came businesswomen in blue, writers in white, artists in pink and musicians in red, all calling for their right to vote. Five thousand women marched while some onlookers hurled insults and tripped them. ?If my wife were where you are,? a police officer told one woman, according to this newspaper, ?I?d break her head. ?   Woodrow Wilson skipped the event, taking side streets to a hotel to avoid the crowds. By the end, more than 100 women were hospitalized. Women had fought for suffrage since at least 1848. But the 1913 march kicked off a series of political actions that swayed the public and male politicians, finally pushing them to pass the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. By 1920, American women had the right to vote. Read how The New York Times covered the march here. On July 28, 1932, Gen. Douglas MacArthur and Army troops surrounded a group of protesting veterans in Washington, wheeled tanks into position, prepared gas bombs and gave the former fighters 30 minutes to disperse. The Bonus Army gathering, in which an estimated 20, 000 World War I veterans demanded the payment of bonuses guaranteed under a 1924 law, is among the   marches in American history. The law had said payments would be made in 1945, but veterans reeling from the Depression wanted them earlier. The event lasted weeks, until President Herbert Hoover ordered the protesters? removal. Army troops shot ?a heavy barrage of tear gas? at the veterans, according to The Times. Two people died during the protest. In ?The Bonus Army: An American Epic,? the authors Paul Dickson and Thomas B. Allen wrote that the march changed the nation, pushing Congress to pass the G. I. Bill, landmark legislation that allowed many veterans to go to college. Read how The Times covered the march here. The National Mall swelled with people on Aug. 28, 1963, to urge Congress to pass a historic civil rights bill. It was here that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. gave his ?I Have a Dream? speech. ?As he arose, a great roar welled up from the crowd,? the journalist E. W. Kenworthy wrote in The Times. ?When he started to speak, a hush fell. ? The paper reported that more than 200, 000 people had attended. At the time, civil rights legislation was tied up in Congress, facing a filibuster by Southern lawmakers. But the march helped energize everyday people like Hazel Mangle Rivers, a black woman who took the $8 overnight bus to Washington from her home in Birmingham, Ala. ?When I get back there tomorrow I?m going to do whatever needs to be done,? she told a Times reporter after the protest. ?I don?t care if it?s picketing or marching or   or what, I?m ready to do it. ? The gathering was followed by sustained activism  ?   including a   drive in Mississippi and a march in Alabama from Selma to Montgomery  ?   that helped pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The march, Mr. Belafonte said recently, showed that there was ?a great swatch of American opinion that was supportive of our cause. ? Read how The Times covered the march here. On Nov. 15, 1969, antiwar activists streamed down Pennsylvania Avenue, calling for a rapid withdrawal of troops from Vietnam. Three drummers led the procession, followed by people carrying 11 coffins bearing names of the dead. Then came rows and rows of marchers, 17 abreast, shouting, ?Peace now! Peace now!? A police official estimated the crowd to be at least 250, 000 strong, though others have said it was much larger. At the time, many Americans had grown impatient with President Richard Nixon?s policy of gradual withdrawal. The White House said the president had spent the day watching college football inside. It was the largest antiwar protest to date. But its success was less clear than the 1963 civil rights gathering. ?In the aftermath of that march, Nixon escalates the war,? Professor Mollin said. Read how The Times covered the march here. The Supreme Court?s decision in Roe v. Wade, which affirmed a woman?s right to an abortion, spurred anger across the country, particularly among religious and conservative families. A year after Roe v. Wade, on Jan. 22, 1974, thousands gathered in Washington to urge Congress to support a constitutional amendment, known as the Buckley Amendment, which would have effectively overturned the decision. When it became clear it wouldn?t happen that year, the march?s founder, Nellie Gray, vowed to hold marches every year until it did. This year?s march, to be held on Jan. 27, will include a particularly prominent speaker: Kellyanne Conway, the   woman in the Trump administration. Read how The Times covered the march here. Andy Humm was a television reporter for the Gay Cable Network on Oct. 11, 1987, when an estimated 200, 000 people gathered in Washington to call for AIDS research and the end of discrimination against gay people. (The event followed a 1979 march, before the AIDS crisis.) By 1987, more than 20, 000 Americans had died of AIDS and an additional 36, 000 had learned they had the disease, which was deeply stigmatizing. Activists were desperate for research and care. They spread a quilt bearing names of the dead. And they wept as Mr. Humm interviewed them. ?There was no hope,? he said in a recent conversation. ?We were a fairly powerless movement back then. ? The march helped mobilize and personalize the movement. Three years later, Congress passed the Ryan White Care Act, the largest federally funded program for people living with H. I. V. and AIDS. (AIDS deaths continued to climb each year until 1995.) Read how The Times covered the march. Hundreds of thousands of people, most of them black men, came together on Oct. 16, 1995, for a rally organized by Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam. He called on them to ?accept the responsibility? to ?be good husbands and fathers and builders of our community. ? It was contentious  ?   Mr. Farrakhan had been criticized previously for sexist and   remarks  ?   and was attended by the poet Maya Angelou but opposed by the N. A. A. C. P. Organizers said the event spurred 1. 7 million black men to register to vote. But the march?s legacy is the subject of debate. ?Some say its core message of   and atonement left black men grappling alone with issues such as violence, drug abuse and poverty, letting politicians and institutions off the hook,? a Washington Post reporter wrote. ?Others argue that the earnest assembly was a potent symbol that changed perceptions of black men and inspired the marchers to make great changes in their lives. ? In 2015, Mr. Farrakhan held a second march. Much of the discussion centered on the use of force by the police and continued discrimination. Art Scott, 59, a salesman who attended, told The Times: ?There comes a time, after being pushed for so long, to push back. I think that?s the feeling in the black community right now. ?

17856,Margot Sanger-Katz,23/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"Donald J. Trump ran on a campaign promise to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. So it should not come as a surprise that he has signed an executive order urging his administration to fight it as much as possible. But that order, alone, won?t allow President Trump to unwind the sprawling health law known as Obamacare. Mr. Trump and Republican leaders in Congress are engaged in negotiations about legislation that might substantially undo or replace the health law. Even before the inauguration, Congress  took a first step toward gutting major provisions. But as that process underscores, major changes to health policy will require new legislation. The Trump executive order should be seen more as a mission statement, and less as a monarchical edict that can instantly change the law. Mr. Trump has sent a strong signal that he intends to fight the health law, but he sent signals that were strong on the campaign trail, too, just in less legalistic language. And the order, crucially, notes that agencies can act only ?to the maximum extent permitted by law. ? (How the Trump administration interprets those permissions, of course, is yet untested.) The order spells out the various ways that a Trump administration might fight the parts of the health law until new legislation comes: by writing new regulations and exercising discretion where allowed. Regulations can be changed, but, as the order notes, only through a legal process of ?notice and comment? that can take months or years. On matters of discretion, the administration can move faster, but there are limited places where current law gives the administration much power to quickly change course. How much of the order is bluster and how much it signals a set of significant policy changes in the pipeline is unclear. The order was not specific and did not direct any particular actions. ?Right off the bat, what do they do  ?   something incredibly cryptic that nobody understands,? said Rodney Whitlock, a vice president of M. L. Strategies, a Washington consulting firm. Mr. Whitlock was a longtime health policy aide to Senator Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa. The easiest way for the Trump administration to undermine the health law would be to stop defending a lawsuit brought by the House of Representatives. That suit said  that the Obama administration lacked the authority to pay certain Obamacare subsidies. A lower court ruled for the House, meaning that by simply withdrawing from the appeal, the Trump administration could start a process to eliminate those subsidies and cause a collapse of the insurance market. Mr. Trump?s order said nothing about that policy choice. Another important area of discretion has to do with exemptions to the law?s unpopular individual mandate to obtain insurance. Under the law, all Americans who can afford it are expected to obtain health insurance, unless they have experienced some hardship that would make it impossible. People who feel there has been such a hardship can apply for an exemption, and employees in the Department of Health and Human Services and the Internal Revenue Service can decide on their case. Under a Trump administration, it might become easier to claim hardship and get out of the requirement to buy insurance. But people seeking those exemptions will still have to apply for them, in writing, and can do so only at particular times of the year. Current law requires them to provide documentation supporting their claim that they have recently filed for bankruptcy, for example, or been evicted, and they must legally attest to their honesty. The Trump administration could create new categories of hardship, but that would take time. And rules that effectively eliminate the requirement would almost certainly result in litigation. ?It?s not a hardship to have to comply with the law, almost by definition,? said Timothy Jost, a professor of law at Washington and Lee University. Mr. Jost, who supports the health law, has examined the underlying regulations in detail. Defanging the individual mandate could have significant consequences for the individual insurance markets. If fewer healthy people buy insurance, the costs of insuring everyone else will rise, leading insurance companies to raise prices or flee the market. Last week, the Congressional Budget Office published its estimate of what would happen under a law that eliminated the mandate and some other provisions: 18 million people would lose their insurance next year alone. It?s possible that insurers will look at the language of the order and get skittish, setting off a market collapse next year. But the order itself doesn?t yet change any rules. The health and human services department and the I. R. S. will have to take further action. ?Is this mostly a symbolic gesture or a signal that they intend to take apart the law piece by piece to the extent they can?? said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health research group. ?At a minimum, this creates a lot of uncertainty for insurers at a pretty critical time. ? The order directs the administration to give states more autonomy in directing health policy. And there?s a clear mechanism for that: Medicaid law provides a process in which states can waive many of the program?s usual rules to attempt ?demonstration projects. ? Administrations have latitude under the law to decide what sort of new programs qualify. Mr. Trump?s selection for the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Seema Verma, has been an innovator in pushing this process in more conservative directions. Her selection, even more than the order, was a sign that the Trump administration would become more open to new Medicaid rules, including possible work requirements to obtain coverage, or premiums even for very poor Americans. But, as with the exemptions, there is still a process for such policy changes. States must submit detailed applications for waivers for the rules, and there is a legal review process that typically takes months. Mr. Trump recently promised that his team was developing a health care plan far better than the Affordable Care Act, that would insure more people and lower their costs. For people who heard that and thought Mr. Trump had gone soft on Obamacare, his executive order may come as a shock. But nothing in the order changes the law on its own. Whether Mr. Trump?s intention is a smooth transition or a rapid disruption in current policy will be determined by what comes next."
18391,Richard P?rez-Pe?a and Rachel Abrams,9/02/2017,2017,2,business,"WASHINGTON  ?   President Trump lashed out on Wednesday at the Nordstrom department store chain for dropping his daughter Ivanka?s accessories and clothing line, once again raising ethical questions about the relationship between his presidency and his family?s sprawling business interests. Mr. Trump has already broken with tradition by singling out companies for criticism, like Boeing, Lockheed Martin, automakers and news organizations, sometimes causing gyrations in their stock prices and prompting debates about whether corporations would tailor their conduct to suit a bellicose president. But in those cases, his ire targeted government contracts, departing American jobs or news coverage  ?   not his own family?s personal fortunes. Six days after Nordstrom announced that, based on sales, it would no longer carry Ms. Trump?s products  ?   a decision that prompted some Trump supporters to call for a boycott of the stores  ?   the president took to Twitter to complain that ?Ivanka has been treated so unfairly? by the company. He first posted the message from his personal account, and then   it from his official White House account. Mr. Trump?s complaint also raised questions about how he might handle the moves of numerous other companies as their relationships with Trump brands change. The large national discount retailers T. J. Maxx and Marshalls, and Neiman Marcus, the luxury department store, for example, have recently taken steps to give less prominence to Ms. Trump?s products. Sean Spicer, Mr. Trump?s press secretary, said the president?s tweet was not about business but about ?an attack on his daughter. ? ?For people to take out their concern about his actions, or his executive orders, on members of his family, he has every right to stand up for his family,? Mr. Spicer said. It was not clear if Mr. Spicer was referring to critics of Mr. Trump who have called for a boycott of businesses bearing the family name, or to some political motive by Nordstrom. After the president temporarily barred people from seven   countries from entering the United States, Nordstrom sent its employees a statement saying that it valued immigrants and offered support to those affected by the executive order. On Wednesday, responding to Mr. Spicer?s comments, Nordstrom maintained that it had pulled Ms. Trump?s products based on their declining sales performance. The company said it informed Ms. Trump of its decision in early January. ?Over the past year, and particularly in the last half of 2016, sales of the brand have steadily declined to the point where it didn?t make good business sense for us to continue with the line for now,? the Nordstrom statement said. ?We?ve had a great relationship with the Ivanka Trump team. ? As Mr. Trump has noted several times, the president is exempt from conflict of interest provisions in federal law that prohibit other government officials from using their positions to benefit themselves or their family members financially. So even if his post was meant to intimidate Nordstrom or other retailers that still work with Ivanka Trump, it probably does not violate conflict of interest rules, said ethics experts, who nonetheless called it inappropriate. ?It is a total misuse of presidential power,? said Lawrence M. Noble, the general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center and formerly the top lawyer at the Federal Election Commission. ?He is really bringing to bear the whole weight of the office of president on a business decision. Take another company that is considering whether or not to drop her line  ?   they obviously are going to ask themselves if they want to be attacked by the president. ? Mr. Trump?s blast at Nordstrom came two days after his wife, Melania, filed a libel lawsuit that described her ?multiyear term? as ?one of the most photographed women in the world?  ?   an apparent reference to her status as a candidate?s wife and now first lady  ?   as a lucrative business opportunity. And Mr. Spicer, the White House spokesman, has urged people to visit the Trump International Hotel in Washington, which opened late last year. Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen, a group that promotes ethics in government, said Mr. Trump?s swipe at Nordstrom was not a major issue in itself. But Mr. Weissman said it demonstrates that as president, Mr. Trump continues to have multiple conflicts of interest with his own and his family?s business interests. Mr. Trump refuses to sell his assets or put them into a blind trust, but he has said that he has ceded operation of his businesses to his adult sons, Donald Jr. and Eric. ?He has committed to severing himself from the family business operations,? Mr. Weissman said. ?That is obviously not the case. ? Ivanka Trump has no formal role in the administration, but her father has included her in meetings with foreign officials and business leaders, and her husband, Jared Kushner, is an adviser to the president. After years as a business executive, Ms. Trump has suddenly found herself without a clear path to walk as she adjusts to life in Washington. She has expressed frustration to a number of associates with Nordstrom?s decision, describing it as a political move and maintaining that the sales of her brand had not sagged. While she is no longer involved in the management of her business, she is said to be acutely aware of the controversies surrounding her product line. The Trump presidency is forcing retailers to rethink their relationships with Trump product lines, weighing how well they sell and what actions will anger or placate the largest number of customers. After Nordstrom said it was dropping Ivanka Trump?s merchandise, Trump supporters on social media began calling for a boycott of the stores. Last week, T. J. Maxx and Marshalls stores sent a note to employees  ?   a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times  ?   telling them to throw away signs for Ivanka Trump products. ?Effective immediately, please remove all Ivanka Trump merchandise from features and mix into? the racks where most products hang, the note read. ?All Ivanka Trump signs should be discarded. ? The instruction was to eliminate special displays for the merchandise, ?not to remove it from the sales floor,? said Doreen Thompson, a spokeswoman for the TJX Companies, the retailers? parent corporation. ?We offer a rapidly changing selection of merchandise for our customers, and brands are featured based on a number of factors,? she said. Ms. Thompson did not respond directly to questions about whether instructing stores to discard signs was unusual. But an employee at one of the company?s stores, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said she had not received such a request during her several years working there. Neiman Marcus recently stopped selling Ms. Trump?s jewelry and accessories through its website, but her clothes are still sold at Macy?s, the nation?s largest department store chain, as well as its sister company Bloomingdale?s, where her shoes and handbags are available online. In August, Bloomingdale?s committed to selling her clothes in seven of its stores, according to a spokeswoman, Anne Keating. ?I think they all have probably been looking closely at Ivanka?s sales numbers and weighing whether they?re worth all the problems she?s brought them,? said Shannon Coulter, who helped found #GrabYourWallet, an online campaign to boycott Trump products."
18081,Roni Caryn Rabin,31/01/2017,2017,1,science,"After learning she had a high genetic risk for breast cancer, Dane?e McCree, like a growing number of women, decided to have her breasts removed. Her doctor assured her that reconstructive surgery would spare her nipples and leave her with   breasts. It did. But while Ms. McCree?s rebuilt chest may resemble natural breasts, it is now completely numb. Her nipples lack any feeling. She cannot sense the slightest touch of her breasts, perceive warmth or cold, feel an itch if she has a rash or pain if she bangs into a door. And no one warned her. ?I can?t even feel it when my kids hug me,? said Ms. McCree, 31, a store manager in Grand Junction, Colo. who is raising two daughters on her own. Plastic surgeons performed more than 106, 000 breast reconstructions in 2015, up 35 percent from 2000. And they have embraced   techniques to improve the appearance of reconstructed breasts and give them a more natural ?look and feel?  ?   using a woman?s belly fat to create the new breast, sparing the nipple, minimizing scarring with creative incisions and offering enhancements like larger, firmer lifted breasts. Doctors often promise patients that their reconstructed breasts will look even better than the breasts they had before. But they often describe the potential consequences of the surgery in ambiguous terms. Women say the fact that sensation and sexual arousal will not be restored is not made clear. The main problem is using the word ?feel,? said Dr. Clara Lee, an associate professor of plastic surgery at Ohio State University who does reconstructive breast surgery. Surgeons who use a woman?s own tissue to recreate a breast might tell the patient that it will ?feel? like a natural breast, referring to how it feels to someone else, not the woman. ?We don?t always mean what?s important to the patient,? Dr. Lee said. ?Our focus has been on what women look like,? said Dr. Andrea L. Pusic, a plastic surgeon at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center who specializes in breast reconstruction and studies patients? quality of life after breast surgery. ?What it feels like to the woman has been a kind of blind spot in breast surgery. That?s the next frontier. ? The focus on how breasts look and feel to other people, rather than how they feel to the patient, speaks to the fact that women are still largely judged by their appearance, said Victoria   a professor and the head of feminist, gender and sexuality studies at Wesleyan University. ?There?s such a strong cultural gaze at women?s breasts,? Dr.   said. ?It does raise the question: Who is breast reconstruction for?? Adding to the confusion has been the excitement over surgical innovations, particularly ? ? mastectomies. During a traditional mastectomy, doctors remove the nipple and scoop out breast tissue, causing considerable nerve damage. But now, in certain cases, the nipple can be spared, raising hopes that some feeling will be preserved. The actress Angelina Jolie wrote about her   preventive double mastectomy in a New York Times   in 2013, inspiring other women at high risk of breast cancer to have their breasts removed. But the   surgery has yet to fulfill its promise, and in most cases, sensation is not restored. For many women, the loss of sensation in their breasts can be devastating. ?No one said, ?You will not have sexual arousal in your chest again,?? Ms. McCree said. ?I thought that because I was able to keep my nipples and the blood supply, I?d keep my feeling. ? Eve Wallinga, 60, a cancer survivor from St. Cloud, Minn. said many women who choose   mastectomies believe that reconstructive surgery will make them ?whole? again and are not told that the sensation lost during the surgery is unlikely to come back. ?They go into it thinking everything will be the same when they come out  ?   they?ll just have   stuffing in their breasts,? Ms. Wallinga said. ?Some are very angry and upset, and say, ?Why wasn?t I told?? They feel very betrayed. ? The lack of sensation is potentially dangerous. Women who have had mastectomies and reconstruction surgery have sustained severe burns on their breasts from heating pads, hair dryers, curling irons, sunbathing and overly hot showers. Several women interviewed recounted times when they had not realized a bra was cutting into their skin until they saw blood. Many described embarrassing ?wardrobe malfunctions,? when a bathing suit or   shifted to reveal part of their breast without their knowing because they did not feel the air on their exposed skin. A doctor recalled a patient who had burned herself while draining hot pasta for dinner she did not realize she was hurt until she saw red marks on her skin in the shower several hours later. Some women described losing the sense of the position of their breasts. ?It?s not just about the sexual arousal, it?s the awkwardness,? said Cathy Balsamo of Berkeley Heights, N. J. ?You can?t figure out your space  ?   almost like you?re bigger than you really are. It?s a bizarre feeling. ? She added, ?When I put on a sports bra, I have to look in the mirror and focus on the breasts to make sure they?re in the pocket where they belong. ? Nerve damage during mastectomies can create   pain syndrome. Some women experience tingling sensations, and others have debilitating pain. Patients say physicians minimize the condition, even though it is fairly common, affecting anywhere from 25 percent to 60 percent of mastectomy patients, according to published studies. Michelle Lamon Romero, 45, of East Longmeadow, Mass. said she had been incapacitated by pain since having a double mastectomy two years ago. She lost her job and now relies on a cocktail of five drugs to keep the pain at a manageable level. ?The surface of the skin is numb  ?   if you run a needle over it, I can?t feel it,? Ms. Romero said. ?But I can feel the pain underneath just radiating everywhere. ? She added that her plastic surgeon had told her that she was an anomaly and that ?this isn?t real, it?s all in your head. ? Other patients Ms. Romero has met through Facebook have had the same experience. ?So many women who join are just relieved to know they?re not alone,? Ms. Romero said. ?They all start out the same way: ?My doctor told me I was crazy. ?? Most surgeons agree that the best chance for sensory restoration after a mastectomy is a procedure that uses a woman?s own body tissue rather than an implant because nerves have a better chance of regenerating in natural tissue. The procedure has produced modest results. If sensation returns, it is usually limited to the perception of pressure, without improved sensation related to touch, temperature or sexual arousal. ?It?s a shadow of the degree of sensation that people had before,? said Dr. Edwin G. Wilkins, a plastic surgeon at the University of Michigan who is running a large study on reconstruction outcomes and complications with Dr. Pusic. ?It?s a poor substitute. ? Dr. Aldona J. Spiegel, a plastic surgeon in Houston who has pioneered techniques to reconnect nerves in the breast and restore sensation, said the procedure remained promising. ?I tell patients that if I am able to reconnect nerves in the reconstructed breast, it will improve the sensation. But I never tell them it will be normal,? Dr. Spiegel said. She added that many of her patients had shown ?very significant improvement. ? One of her patients, Karen Holt, 65, a retired principal from Houston, had her left breast removed and reconstructed from her own tissue 14 years ago. Ms. Holt knows she?s unusual, she said, but claims she has ?just about as much erogenous sensation in the left breast as in the right. ? But doctors say such results are rare. ?You don?t want to give people false hope,? said Dr. Frank J. DellaCroce, a plastic surgeon and a founder of the Center for Restorative Breast Surgery in New Orleans. Restoring sensation is ?one of those things that?s regarded as the holy grail of breast reconstruction,? he said. ?But no one has shown in any scientific article to date that we?re able to return sensation in any reliable way. ? Dr. Christine Laronga, a breast oncologist at the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Fla. said she tried to make clear to patients that feeling would not be restored after reconstruction, telling them, ?It may look like a breast, but it won?t feel like a breast. ? While doctors agree on the need for a mastectomy procedure that spares nerves, they note that the goal of the surgery is to make sure the cancer is gone. There is also a risk that efforts to restore sensation will trigger a pain syndrome. ?It?s a very tricky area,? said Dr. Ida K. Fox, a plastic surgeon at Washington University in St. Louis who specializes in breast and hand surgery. ?You don?t want to restore sensation and give someone chronic pain. ? Ms. Balsamo, 50, who had a double mastectomy after testing positive for a genetic mutation that increases breast cancer risk, said she did not regret the surgery, but wished she had been better informed. ?I just wish I had known,? Ms. Balsamo said. ?They said there?s going to be a difference in the sensation  ?   not that there wouldn?t be any. Before you go in, shouldn?t you know the facts??"
17783,Dave Itzkoff,19/01/2017,2017,1,entertainment,"Whether or not you eat what McDonald?s serves, let?s at least agree the   giant has a knack for putting together unexpected ingredients in a way that no one had seen before. The same could be said about ?The Founder,? the biographical film about Ray A. Kroc (played by Michael Keaton) the onetime   salesman who helped transform McDonald?s from a roadside stand in San Bernardino, Calif. to an empire of golden arches. The movie (in wide release Jan. 20) also stars Nick Offerman and John Carroll Lynch as Richard and Maurice McDonald, the brothers (known as Dick and Mac) who created the namesake restaurants and invented the   system, then entered into an uneasy partnership with Kroc, who took over the company. If Kroc is the    engine of ?The Founder,? then the McDonald brothers are its heart  ?   the loyal siblings whose ingenuity and traditional values are eventually overwhelmed by their new partner?s relentless hustle. The characters also represent a rare pairing for Mr. Offerman (a star of ?Parks and Recreation?) and Mr. Lynch (whose films include ?Fargo,? ?Zodiac? and ?Jackie?) two steadily working, sturdily built actors known for quirky, distinctive roles  ?   outdoorsmen, lawyers, presidents, mass murderers  ?   that stick in your memory, yet who had never acted together before. Mr. Offerman and Mr. Lynch spoke recently by phone about family relationships, onscreen and off, and shared their innermost thoughts about the McDonald?s menu. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. You each own a very particular piece of turf in your individual careers. Did you ever cross paths in the industry before? NICK OFFERMAN Thank you for accusing us of offering unique and individual work. JOHN CARROLL LYNCH Or having a place in this industry. I think we met the night before we started working. OFFERMAN There had been a couple of indie movies where I almost got cast in a thing or two that you were working in. And then they found out I had not worked at the Guthrie [Theater] and they moved on. LYNCH You?ll be happy to know that I read for Ron Swanson [on ?Parks and Recreation?]. I don?t think we ever talked about that. OFFERMAN Oh no! LYNCH Absolutely. Yes, that?s true. I read for Ron Swanson, and they wisely chose Nick. OFFERMAN It must have been a height issue  ?   that?s the only thing I can think of. Was there any time to develop your familial bond before you started playing the brothers? LYNCH We had one day of rehearsal. There were a couple of things that Nick and I were given for biographical background. There were recordings of Dick [McDonald]  ?   Dictaphone audio memos to the company, to listen to his voice and the way he regarded his brother. I remember hearing such great love and esteem in his voice. Also, the first day of our shoot was the day they tell the story of their long rise to success. It was a lot of fun and set the groundwork for the remainder of the work. OFFERMAN In the scene he?s talking about, John had several minutes of exposition monologue that was the first thing we shot in this restaurant with Michael Keaton. John rattled the entire piece with enthusiasm and absolute vim and vigor. He finished the take, and everybody?s jaw dropped, and Keaton was like, ?Well. All right. Moving on. ? Did you ever work in the   industry? LYNCH I never worked at McDonald?s, but I worked at Burger King for a couple of minutes. I was at a waiter at a pub near the Catholic University of America, where I went to college. I waited on Ed Herrmann [the actor] once. I screwed up his order. He didn?t want the ribs. I also worked at the Boston Sea Party, in Denver [where he was raised] shucking oysters. I?d never seen an oyster, let alone knew how to shuck one. After a series of   shifts, I was like, I?ve got to get a job at   just to heal my hands. OFFERMAN When I?d just gotten my driver?s license, a friend of mine was a manager at a Hardee?s in Joliet. And I wanted to buy a used car for about $1, 500. So I started working some shifts for her, flipping burgers. And I had just about amassed the sum that I desired, when I got in a vehicular disagreement with an older lady at an intersection, the long and the short of which is, I was at fault, and it cost me $1, 500. I took that as a lesson that a career in   was not for me. What role did McDonald?s play in your lives growing up? OFFERMAN When I was a kid, we?d go to swimming lessons on Saturday, in the other big town, Morris, Ill. and as a reward for not perishing, we would be taken to McDonald?s, where we were allowed to purchase a    sandwich. That was the filet mignon of my youth. More important, we were crazy about the packaging, because all of our ?Star Wars? action figures fit neatly in the hash browns? cardboard sleeve, and you could make all kinds of vehicles out of those clamshell boxes. LYNCH I had a McDonald?s at the end of my paper route when I was a kid. I was young enough [that] my mother would say, ?What kind of Coke would you like?? And I would say, ?Orange. ? Because all sodas were Coke. Over the course of my childhood, it stopped being just hamburgers and cheeseburgers, and they introduced things like the    and the Big Mac. I remember when the Big Mac came out. It was a big deal for me. OFFERMAN I forgot about that  ?   in my youth, when they would release a new sandwich like the Big Mac, it was like the new iPhone. LYNCH There were certainly times when there would be as much discussion in my elementary school class as anybody standing at an Apple store today. OFFERMAN ?Let me get this straight: There?s a bun in the middle of the other bun? Get out of here. ? Isn?t that a special piece of bread? LYNCH I like the fact that you call it special. I would call it utterly useless, other than for its stated purpose, which is to have enough special sauce on it to literally cause a heart attack. OFFERMAN It?s a propagandist?s master stroke. It literally says, this sandwich is so monumental, we had to add an extra level of bread. LYNCH It becomes a   sandwich. Before, they just had   sandwiches. Then, there were two. Having now played these characters, can you ever look at McDonald?s or fast food the same way again? LYNCH I see how the McDonald brothers transformed, for good or for ill, how America eats  ?   and frankly how the world eats. It was in some ways more transforming to our bodies than the Model A. I think that?s both a triumph and a bit chilling. That transforms American capitalism from personal success based on hard work and quality of work, to inventive, dominant business models. When the McDonald brothers were developing the way to get you your sandwich in 30 seconds and not 30 minutes, they didn?t foresee that it would take the place of the family dinner every day. It has ramifications around my own midsection that I didn?t see coming. OFFERMAN I?m a big fan of the writing of people like Eric Schlosser and Michael Pollan. So I was very much on board with the exposing of this worldwide   system, in which we?re pretty much all complicit. It?s emblematic of how we?ve grown disconnected [from] where our food comes from, who makes and grows our food. It?s all related. It allows us to elect people to office that perhaps don?t have the healthiest ingredients. Perhaps they have an extra bun that is inexplicable. Is it difficult, after playing such close brothers, to part company and go your separate ways?  OFFERMAN Every acting job is sort of like a family reunion. Sometimes you work with an actor and you think, oh, yes, you are one of the drunks in the family. Or you?re passive aggressive. Or you?re just crazy. You make a mental note at future family reunions to steer clear of that one. But then there are family members where you say, oh, we?ve got something similar. We?re terrific on the volleyball court together. So every time there?s a rumor of volleyball happening, I?m going to hope that John Carroll Lynch shows up. And I will do my best to set up his sweet spike move. LYNCH There was an opportunity that Nick and I might work together again. That became not possible,  . I know I will look for another opportunity at any time to work with him. OFFERMAN I don?t feel the same. LYNCH That?s why I?m just going to chase you, man. It?s just going to be a stalker situation. I?ve got my   goggles. I?m sitting on a tree, right now, just waiting for darkness."
18331,"Michael D. Shear, Ron Nixon, Charlie Savage and Maggie Haberman",7/02/2017,2017,2,politics,"? The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, took aim on Monday afternoon at a New York Times story that described President Trump watching television in his bathrobe. ? Opposition to Mr. Trump?s travel restrictions on certain countries mounted, but the president remained defiant and unbowed. ? Mr. Trump turned to Twitter early Monday and began challenging polls that showed his travel order was not popular. ? A bipartisan group of former National Security Council officials filed court documents opposing the ban. ? The Justice Department corrected the record on how many people had their visas canceled because of the ban. Mr. Spicer denounced The Times?s account, published Sunday night, of the president?s turbulent adjustment to life in the White House. In particular, he zeroed in on one detail among a few paragraphs of the story that he insisted were wrong: that the president has worn a bathrobe while alone in the White House residence. ?That is literally the epitome of fake news,? Mr. Spicer told reporters traveling with Mr. Trump. ?Start at the top. I don?t think the president owns a bathrobe. He definitely doesn?t wear one. ? The White House staff stocks the official residence with bathrobes. Within moments of Mr. Spicer?s comment, reporters on Twitter posted photos of a much younger Mr. Trump lounging in a bathrobe. Mr. Spicer added that the story was ?so riddled with inaccuracies and lies that they owe the president an apology. ? He went on, ?Literally, blatant factual errors, and it?s unacceptable to see that kind of reporting or   reporting. ? The overall piece, which described Mr. Trump?s first two weeks in office as he attempts a dramatic   of a Washington culture he has never inhabited, was ?not an accurate portrayal of what?s really happening,? Mr. Spicer concluded. Mr. Trump appeared not to like the news he was reading Monday morning. In one Twitter post, the president rejected reports of polls showing that a majority of Americans oppose his travel order. In another, he appeared to lash out at suggestions that Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist, holds the real power in the West Wing. A CNN poll released over the weekend said that 55 percent of Americans viewed Mr. Trump?s travel order as an attempt to keep Muslims out of the country. The president also seemed angry about the    story line, which was featured in a Time magazine article and in a ?Saturday Night Live? skit showing Mr. Bannon as the Grim Reaper directing Mr. Trump?s activities in the White House. On Twitter, Mr. Trump called the reports ?fake news? that sought to marginalize him. If you missed Mr. Trump talking to Bill O?Reilly of Fox News during the Super Bowl, you will have another chance tonight. Mr. Trump continued his screed against news coverage of him on Monday, training his fire at The New York Times in an apparent reaction to a portrait of his early stumbles published in Monday?s editions. In a Twitter post, Mr. Trump appeared to characterize The Times?s coverage, which was based on interviews with several of his White House?s most senior officials and others aware of the administration?s inner workings, as ?fiction? based on fabricated sources. Mr. Trump has long delighted in denigrating The Times and claiming, falsely, that its coverage of him has led to declining readership. But in a meeting at The Times in November, he called the paper, which is among his first reads each morning, ?a great, great American jewel. ? Last week, The Times surpassed three million print and digital subscriptions, adding 276, 000 net   subscriptions in the last three months of the year, more additions than in 2013 and 2014 combined. It?s official: Silicon Valley really, really despises Mr. Trump?s immigration order. Overnight, 97 companies  ?   most of them technology firms, including Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft  ?   filed a legal brief arguing that the ban is unconstitutional and harms the interests of American businesses. The brief, filed with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, is blunt and direct. The ban, it says, ?hinders the ability of American companies to attract great talent increases costs imposed on business makes it more difficult for American firms to compete in the international marketplace and gives global enterprises a new, significant incentive to build operations  ?   and hire new employees  ?   outside the United States. ? It is a remarkable statement of unity from the country?s technology companies, many of which rely heavily on foreign workers. And it is a shot across the bow for Mr. Trump, foreshadowing a rocky relationship with Silicon Valley leaders over the next four years. The companies were not the only ones joining in opposition. Susan E. Rice, former President Barack Obama?s national security adviser, was among the leaders of a petition signed by a group of former National Security Council officials. The Justice Department on Monday corrected the record on an   claim that one of its lawyers made in a Northern Virginia courtroom about the impact of President Trump?s executive order on visitors from seven   countries. The government lawyer provoked gasps in the courtroom when he told Judge Leonie Brinkema, one of the Federal District Court judges weighing legal challenges to Mr. Trump?s order, that more than 100, 000 visas had been revoked as a result of the order  ?   far more than had been understood to be the case. That number, however, came under question later on Friday, when a spokesman for the State Department?s Bureau of Consular Affairs said that the real number was around 60, 000 and that the larger figure had inaccurately included diplomatic visas that were not affected by the ban. On Monday, the department submitted a filing to Judge Brinkema that corrected its statement in the court. ?In response to a question from this court as to how many individuals have been affected by the executive order, government counsel presenting oral argument, based on information he had received, stated that 100, 000 visas had been provisionally revoked as a result of the executive order,? it said. ?The Department of State has since provided undersigned counsel with a revised number, which is roughly 60, 000 visas. ? An outside,   political group is adding veteran   and Republican Party strategists, and is also employing one of the president?s campaign ad makers to try to ensure Senate confirmation of his remaining cabinet nominees. The group, 45Committee, has signed Larry Weitzner of Jamestown Associates, which produced most of Mr. Trump?s campaign ads in the general election. Mr. Weitzner?s first spot will air nationally this week, with a gauzy focus on the initial days of the Trump presidency. It?s part of a $4 million effort, with three other ads focused specifically on the nominations of Betsy DeVos for education secretary, Jeff Sessions for attorney general and Tom Price for secretary of health and human services. Some of those ads have been broadcast in states with critical races in the 2018 midterms. The other new advisers are Cara Mason, who worked as the finance director for the Trump Victory committee under Reince Priebus Rob Collins, a former National Republican Senatorial Committee executive director Mike Shields, a former Republican National Committee chief of staff and Rob Simms, a former National Republican Congressional Committee executive director. With Mr. Trump?s administration still evolving, the 45Committee has moved to fill a void, supporting the White House as it finds itself besieged by critics. Joe Arpaio, the former Arizona sheriff known for his uncompromising stance on illegal immigration, is back in the news months after losing his bid for  . Now he is asking supporters to help him raise $1 million for his legal defense fund. Mr. Arpaio faced numerous lawsuits alleging abuse and faulty medical care in several jails, and taxpayers in Maricopa County, where he was sheriff, spent tens of millions of dollars for his legal defense. In his email, Mr. Arpaio attributed his   defeat to a host of enemies, including ?leftist financier George Soros,? the American Civil Liberties Union and the Obama administration?s Justice Department. Mr. Soros spent an estimated $2 million last year opposing Mr. Arpaio, and the Justice Department under Mr. Obama filed criminal    charges against the sheriff for refusing a judge?s order to stop discriminating against Latinos. As the sheriff of Arizona?s largest county, Mr. Arpaio gained a national reputation for immigration raids that targeted heavily Hispanic neighborhoods in and around the Phoenix area. Thousands of people were caught up in the raids, which were often carried out without any proof of criminal activity, and which critics called racial profiling."
17863,Julie Bosman,23/01/2017,2017,1,lifestyle,"NILES, Mich.  ?   When Jennifer Purucker, 31, was asked on Saturday morning what she thought of the Women?s March on Washington, she took a sip of coffee and shook her head. ?Never heard of it,? she said. Crystal Mangold, 38, paused as she carried her young daughter down Main Street. ?No idea what it is,? she said. Angie Searles, 45, perked up at the mention. ?Oh, I just saw that on the news,? she said. ?I don?t know anyone who?s going. ? The march galvanized hundreds of thousands of women across the country who packed buses and airplanes to flock to the nation?s capital to fight for reproductive and civil rights under the Trump administration. Across the country, they rallied en masse on Saturday in downtowns, wearing pink   knit ?pussy hats,? waving handmade signs and sharing pictures on social media with the hashtag #WomensMarch. But as conversations unfolded in Niles, a riverfront town of 11, 000 in southwest Michigan, it was a reminder of how the country has become a split screen on issue after issue. ?Those women don?t represent me or my viewpoints,? said Leta Nielsen, 66, a retired teacher, who added that she hoped that demonstrators would not start fires like the ones she saw on the news from the protests surrounding the inauguration on Friday. In Niles, the biggest draw of the weekend was the annual ice festival, which attracted people from all over the region to admire elaborate ice sculptures lining the sidewalks, participate in a 5K race and sample the tall, spicy bloody marys at the Brass Eye cocktail lounge. ?I don?t think my husband would support me going,? said Stephanie Palmisano, 26, a medical worker who supported Hillary Clinton but whose husband voted for President Trump. ?Trump winning has caused a lot of tough conversations in our marriage. I have two little girls. For a president who thinks so low of women, it just breaks my heart. ? Lucy VandenHeede, 79, said that her    and two granddaughters had taken a bus to Washington from Kalamazoo, Mich. to attend the march and that she was cheering them on from afar. Women?s rights have come a long way, she said, recalling the days when she worked in the newspaper business selling advertising and was paid far less than her male colleagues. ?They earned commission, and I didn?t,? she said. ?And I was always called ?Mrs. John VandenHeede.? I didn?t even have a name. ? ?She was the best salesman in the bunch, too,? said her husband, Mr. VandenHeede. Other women sharply questioned the notion of protesting a president whose administration had begun only the day before. ?It?s kind of offensive,? said Linda Hine, 56, an accounting manager who voted for Mr. Trump. ?People are just criticizing because they didn?t get their way. All it did was force another reason for people to be divided. ? Ms. Hine interpreted Mr. Trump?s inaugural speech on Friday as a generous, uplifting call to bring people together, contradicting the belief of others that it had painted an overly dark and gloomy picture of the country. ?It was about unity,? she said. Her friend Kim Redman, 48, said that as opponents of abortion, they would not have felt welcome at the march anyway, echoing a frequent complaint that only women who favor abortion rights were encouraged to attend. If women would just give Mr. Trump a chance, he might not be as bad as they expect, she said. ?He?s our president no matter what,? she said. Why do women need a march at all, some people asked, when they have made so many gains in the past few decades? ?Women have equal opportunities in the workplace now. We?ve got minorities in jobs. The glass ceilings have opened up all across the nation,? said Tammy Chesney, 53, a carpenter, adding that she had never experienced discrimination on the job. She shrugged off Mr. Trump?s comments that he had grabbed women?s genitals without asking permission. ?It wasn?t nice,? she said. ?But he apologized, and it was in the past. It was blown all out of proportion. ? There are bigger concerns in Niles than expanding the rights of women, many people said. They worry about the state of local schools, the cost of health care and the town?s economy, which has struggled with the loss of manufacturing jobs. Mr. Trump?s campaign promise to ?Make America Great Again? had special resonance in Rust Belt towns like Niles, said Tracy Guetterman, 49, a retail manager, as she stopped to show her    granddaughter Melanie an ice sculpture in the shape of ?U. S. A. ? ?Personally, I?d love to see our country go back to one parent working, like the good old days,? she said. ?I want to be able to quit my job. ? Ms. Guetterman saw the marches as nothing more than complaining from liberals. ?Quit blaming everybody for your problems,? she said. ?Get out there and do it yourself. ? Yet many of the sentiments from the Women?s March were echoed in the voices of people in Niles, about 600 miles from Washington. Diane Kellenburger, 69, a retired executive for a nonprofit organization who had purple streaks in her gray hair, showed off a gold medal from the 5K race, where she had the fastest finish in her age group. She had friends who went to a nearby march in Valparaiso, Ind. and she shared their disgust at Mr. Trump?s attitude toward women. ?Personally, that?s why I didn?t vote for him,? she said. ?We?ve come so far with women?s rights. I have a high level of concern that we?re stepping backward. ? Kim Shelton sat behind the counter of her memorabilia shop downtown, a business that she said is dependent on tourists, as local people have so little to spend these days. Michigan flipped to Mr. Trump, she insisted, because its residents believe he is a successful businessman who can turn things around. Ms. Shelton is not so sure whether he will pull that off, she said, but she is convinced that he does not respect women like her. ?I keep hoping, but I don?t think he?s going to change,? she said. ?I think women are going to take a few steps back with Trump. ?"
17644,Matthew Rosenberg and Adam Goldman,18/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"WASHINGTON  ?   America?s intelligence chiefs sat down with members of Congress behind closed doors on Friday for what they thought would be a straightforward briefing on Russian cyberattacks. What ensued instead was a confrontation Democrats have long sought with James B. Comey, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Why, the House Democrats demanded to know, did Mr. Comey believe it was O. K. to make repeated disclosures during the campaign about the investigation into Hillary Clinton?s emails but to this day refuse to say if the F. B. I. is investigating links between the Trump campaign and Russia? His answers did not prove very satisfying. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader, grew so frustrated that at one point she chastised Mr. Comey for being ?condescending to members. ? Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, who was chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee when it was hacked, asked why Mr. Comey had never called her about the intrusions, which began in August 2015 and continued over the course of many months. The F. B. I. notified the committee of the original hacking, but reached a   tech support contractor and went back and forth with him for months before the leadership of the organization was informed and took steps to halt the intrusion. The committee and the bureau have blamed each other for the delay, and the pattern continued on Friday, according to multiple Democrats in the meeting. Afterward, Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, called the tenor of the exchanges ?contentious at times. ? ?I don?t want to go into the contents of what were discussed,? Mr. Schiff said. But ?a great many members are concerned with whether the director has employed a double standard. ? The hearing took place a day after the Justice Department?s inspector general said it was investigating Mr. Comey?s decision during the campaign to hold a news conference announcing the end of the case  ?   and then, just before the election, inform Congress there was possible new evidence only to say days later that it did not amount to anything. Mr. Comey ?didn?t really answer,? said Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York. He dismissively referred to Mr. Comey as ?a policeman,? and added, ?I don?t remember anything substantive he said. ? The reaction to the assessment by intelligence agencies that Russia sought to promote the candidacy of Donald J. Trump has been mixed. Mr. Trump has seen it as undermining his electoral victory and ridiculed the agencies, accusing them this week of using leaks to discredit him after it briefed him on a dossier of unsubstantiated reports of compromising personal information the Russians allegedly collected. But on Friday, Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, and the panel?s vice chairman, Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, announced that the committee would hold hearings on the Russian activity and its effect on the election. Before Russians were an issue, there was the F. B. I. investigation into whether Mrs. Clinton or her aides mishandled classified information that was in emails on a private server she was using. Mr. Comey discussed the investigation and sharply criticized Mrs. Clinton at a news conference announcing that no charges would be brought against her. He also wrote two letters near the end of the campaign that Clinton supporters say cost her the election. But Mr. Comey has not publicly commented on whether there are any open investigations of Mr. Trump or anyone associated with his campaign. Democrats said the closest Mr. Comey came on Friday to offering an explanation for his actions was to say he would only disclose an ongoing investigation if the public had an overwhelming need to know about it or if it was obvious there was one underway. He said he did not believe any possible investigation into Trump or his associates met either standard. The F. B. I. ?s position is that it does not discuss counterintelligence investigations that could compromise important methods and sources. Speaking to reporters afterward, Ms. Pelosi said that ?really, the American people are owed the truth. ? ?There is a great deal of evidence to say that this is an issue of high interest to the American people,? she continued. ?For that reason, the F. B. I. should let us know whether they?re doing that investigation or not. They?re usually inscrutable. ? The F. B. I. declined to comment on the meeting. Mr. Nadler said he thought Mr. Comey should have been fired ?months ago. ? Other Democrats, perhaps concerned about who Mr. Trump would name to replace Mr. Comey, either said that he should remain on the job or that they were still unsure. The meeting in the auditorium of the Capitol?s visitor center was standing room only. Some Republicans unsurprisingly had a different reaction. ?Their questions and comments seemed to make the case that Hillary Clinton would be president if it were not for hacking,? Representative Steve King of Iowa said. Mr. King left the meeting unconvinced about the Russian hacking, which the intelligence chiefs did manage to discuss amid the questions about Mr. Comey?s conduct. The congressman added that he thought ?some? intelligence officials were trustworthy. But ?not all. People there need to be rooted out,? he said without elaborating."

Gorsuch, to the U. S. Supreme Court, presaging yet another political battle in Washington. The    nominee?s legal philosophy echoes that of Justice Antonin Scalia, whose seat he will fill if confirmed. In Congress, Democrats sought to delay confirmation for Mr. Trump?s cabinet picks after he fired the acting attorney general for defying his contentious immigration order. About 1, 000 American diplomats around the world have signed a   dissent cable objecting to the order, and legal challenges are mounting.

18012,Jack Healy,29/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"MOUNT GILEAD, Ohio  ?   The challenge Annette Cottrell pondered was how to grade President Trump?s stormy first full week on the job. A trade war bubbling up with Mexico. A divisive border wall. A ban on refugees from   countries. Brawls with the news media and national parks. ?I?d give him an ? Ms. Cottrell, 38, said from her salon, Mane Attraction, on Main Street here in the seat of a conservative Ohio county of pastures and maple groves where Mr. Trump won 70 percent of the vote. ?He?s doing what he said he was going to be doing. ? So, about that   week. Mr. Trump drew a torrent of criticism after pressing a series of falsehoods about voter fraud, the size of the crowd at his inauguration and his attacks on the intelligence community. His   executive actions reversing years of policy on immigration, abortion and the environment left his critics seething and fearful and liberal opponents preparing a volley of legal challenges to blunt them. But in more than two dozen interviews this week, voters who helped hand Mr. Trump the presidency  ?     and reluctant supporters alike  ?   were cheering from their living rooms, offices and diners across America as they saw the outlines of a new conservative era in government fast taking shape, even if they were still a little uneasy about the man doing the shaping. Yes, they said, Mr. Trump should tone down his tweets and rein in what they gently called his impulse toward ?exaggeration. ? ?Honestly, he sometimes needs to shut up,? said Joshua Wade, 24, of Ann Arbor, Mich. a state that had not supported a Republican for president since George Bush in 1988. ?Just do what we elected you to do. We won. Drop the inauguration stuff. It?s fine. ? Gun rights top Mr. Wade?s wish list for the new administration. He wants Supreme Court nominees friendly to gun owners and laws that extend   rights across state lines. He said he had been encouraged that Mr. Trump took swift action on some campaign promises during his early days in office. ?There?s no doubt: He?s good at showmanship,? said Mr. Wade, a registered Republican. ?But I think this first week is proving he?s capable of following through on that with real action. ? But what appeals to supporters may be turning off independents. A Quinnipiac University poll released on Thursday gave Mr. Trump only a 36 percent job approval rating and found that majorities of people surveyed said he was neither honest nor levelheaded. Still, Trump voters interviewed said they cared little if the president spouted off on Twitter because he was issuing the kind of executive actions many had long craved  ?   freezing federal grant money for environmental research, banning foreign aid for groups that give abortion counseling and cutting off immigration from several   nations. ?Trump?s done more in five days than Obama did in eight years,? said Doug Cooperrider, 58, who works in construction repairing bridges and roads around central Ohio. The bar at Boondocks, where Mr. Cooperrider dug into a B. L. T. sandwich on a sleety morning, sits about 1, 900 miles from the Arizona deserts where sections of the   border wall may rise. The Hispanic population is tiny in this overwhelmingly white county of 35, 000, and it has grown only 0. 3 percent in the past five years. Still, people here said they felt as if immigration had undercut wages for construction workers in the area. One man said he was uneasy about the longstanding Somali community in Columbus, about an hour?s drive south. Several embraced Mr. Trump?s directives that limited new refugees, ordered up the border wall and cut off federal grant money to cities labeled sanctuaries for immigrants. ?I?m 100 percent behind the wall,? said Ms. Cottrell, the salon owner. ?If he asked me to lay the first brick, I?d sign up. I?m tired of them being here illegally and cutthroating the rest of us. ? She and her husband, Andrew, a Navy veteran, said their views of government had been colored by years spent struggling to get a disability claim approved for him by the Department of Veterans Affairs. They were early and enthusiastic Trump supporters, and when they went on road trips this year, they gauged their candidate?s support by counting up his yard signs and Hillary Clinton?s. Mr. Cottrell, 34, said he supported aid to feed and shelter refugees  ?   but he blanched at welcoming them here. ?It should be about America first,? Mr. Cottrell said. ?We see way too many vets waiting in line, homeless, while we?re helping refugees and immigrants. ? Mr. Cottrell said he had wanted Mr. Trump to gut the   staff of the V. A. and was disappointed when he instead kept on an Obama administration official to oversee the agency. But he said that did not affect his support for Mr. Trump. ?I have never seen someone make promises and immediately start keeping them,? he said. Most of those promises are a long way from fulfilled. The Affordable Care Act remains the law of the land. Efforts to build the Keystone XL pipeline or finish the Dakota Access pipeline could become mired in years of litigation. There is no agreement on how to pay for a $20 billion Mexican border wall. But moves like banning funding for overseas health providers who discuss abortion have a more rapid effect. Laura Alexandria, the director of operations for Grand Rapids Right to Life in Michigan, said she hoped to see the federal government soon remove financing for Planned Parenthood in the United States. ?We have a   president back in the White House, and that is very encouraging,? she said. Ms. Alexandria said she had been in Washington for the inauguration, and she was back there this week for Friday?s March for Life by abortion opponents. She said her organization had organized 12 buses to take people from Michigan to the march. If President Obama was a   ?Rorschach test? for voters in 2008, Mr. Trump?s actions calling for curbing regulations and repealing Obamacare were   sketches. He roughed them out, and his supporters filled in the details. Robert Kersey, 82, the president of an   foundry in Muncie, Ind. said he hoped Mr. Trump would pull back a recent announcement from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration addressing silica dust, which can lead to debilitating and fatal lung diseases. Mr. Kersey said he sees the rule as a burden and does not believe it will make his employees safer. Inside a gift shop in Mount Gilead?s   downtown, Amanda Abdon, 28, said she was eager for a repeal of the health care tax penalty her boyfriend had to pay this year.

Ms. Meimer said of the president. ?I wish somebody would grab his phone. But it seems to take the press?s mind off what he?s really doing. ?"
17960,Kimiko de Freytas-Tamura,28/01/2017,2017,1,business,"George Orwell?s classic book ?1984,? about a dystopian future where critical thought is suppressed under a totalitarian regime, has seen a surge in sales this month, rising to the top of the Amazon   list in the United States and leading its publisher to have tens of thousands of new copies printed. Craig Burke, the publicity director at Penguin USA, said that the publisher had ordered 75, 000 new copies of the book this week and that it was considering another reprint. ?We?ve seen a big bump in sales,? Mr. Burke said. He added that the rise ?started over the weekend and hit hyperactive? on Tuesday and Wednesday morning. Since Friday, the book has reached a 9, 500 percent increase in sales, he said. He said demand began to lift on Sunday, shortly after the interview Kellyanne Conway, an adviser to Donald J. Trump, gave on ?Meet the Press. ? In defending a false claim by the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, that Mr. Trump had attracted the ?largest audience ever to witness an inauguration,? Ms. Conway used a turn of phrase that struck some observers as similar to the dystopian world of ?1984. ? When asked on NBC?s ?Meet the Press? why Mr. Spicer had said something that was provably false, Ms. Conway replied airily, ?Don?t be so dramatic. ? Mr. Spicer, she said, ?gave alternative facts. ? In the novel, the term ?newspeak? refers to language in which independent thought, or ?unorthodox? political ideas, have been eliminated. ?Doublethink? is defined as ?reality control. ? On social media and elsewhere on Sunday, the book?s readers made a connection between Ms. Conway?s comments and Orwell?s language, and the attention on the book ?kind of took a life of its own,? Mr. Burke said. The dictionary publisher   described the interview as ?fraught with epistemological tension. ? The dictionary also reported that searches for the word ?fact? spiked after Ms. Conway?s comments, and then, as an apparent reminder, tweeted the dictionary?s definition. Even outside the United States, interest in ?1984? has grown. So far this year, sales have risen by 20 percent in Britain and Australia compared to the same period a year ago, according to Jess Harrison, a   editor at Penguin Books. The novel is usually a   she said, and it sold 100, 000 copies last year in   countries outside the United States and Canada. ?But we?ve definitely seen an uplift? in sales, she added. Dystopian novels are ?chiming with people,? Ms. Harrison said, adding that ?The Man in the High Castle? by Philip K. Dick, an alternative history in which the Nazis defeated America to win World War II, is also selling well. A television series based on Mr. Dick?s novel is now in its second season at Amazon. Penguin also published Sinclair Lewis?s ?It Can?t Happen Here,? about the rise of a demagogue, last Friday in Britain for the first time since 1935, ?and we?re already on to our third printing,? Mr. Burke said. On Wednesday, that book was also ranking among Amazon?s best sellers, as was Aldous Huxley?s ?Brave New World,? another dystopian classic. Prof. Stefan Collini, a professor of intellectual history and an expert on Orwell at the University of Cambridge, said that readers see a natural parallel between the book and the way Mr. Trump and his staff have distorted facts. ?Everyone remembers ?1984? as containing various parodies of official distortions,? he said. ?That kind of unreality that is propagated as reality is what people feel reminded of, and that?s why they keep coming back. ?"
17401,Adam Nossiter,19/01/2017,2017,1,law,"NICE, France  ?   At times it was hard to know who was on trial, the smuggler or the state. The defendant, C?dric Herrou, 37, a slightly built olive farmer, did not deny that for months he had illegally spirited dozens of migrants through the remote mountain valley where he lives. He would do it again, he suggested. Instead, when asked by a judge, ?Why do you do all this?? Mr. Herrou turned the tables and questioned the humanity of France?s practice of rounding up and turning back Africans entering illegally from Italy in search of work and a better life. It was ?ignoble,? he said. ?There are people dying on the side of the road,? Mr. Herrou replied. ?It?s not right. There are children who are not safe. It is enraging to see children, at 2 in the morning, completely dehydrated. ?I am a Frenchman,? Mr. Herrou declared. The trial, which began on Wednesday, is no ordinary one. It has been substantially covered by the French news media for its rich symbolism and for the way it neatly sums up the ambiguity of France?s policy toward the unceasing flow of migrants into Europe and the quandary they present. France, foremost among European nations, prides itself on enlightened humanitarianism, fraternity and solidarity. And yet, perhaps first among them, too, it is struggling to reconcile those values with the pressing realities of a smaller, more globalized world, including fear of terrorism. The contradictions are being played out in courtrooms, in politics and in farmers? fields, on the sidewalks of Paris and in train stations from the C?te d?Azur to the northern port of Calais, where the government demolished a giant migrant camp in the fall. On the one hand, politicians in this year?s presidential election are competing to see who can take the toughest line on securing France?s borders. Most are promising a crackdown on migrants, with admission reserved for   cases of political persecution. Terrorist attacks, including the one last summer in Nice that killed 85 people, have exacerbated   sentiment. But in these remote mountain valleys, where Jews fleeing the Nazis and the Vichy collaborators found refuge during World War II, Mr. Herrou has become something of a folk hero by leading a kind of loosely knit underground railroad to smuggle migrants north, many destined for Britain or Germany. His work has won him admiration for his resistance to the state and his stand that it is simply right to help one?s fellow man, woman or child. Others in this region seem to agree. In the square outside the   courthouse, hundreds of sympathizers gathered and shouted, ?We are all children of immigrants!? Mr. Herrou got a hero?s welcome as he descended the steep steps late in the evening, trailed by television cameras. Inside, not even the prosecutor,   Pr?tre, seemed to want him there and praised his cause as ?noble. ? He asked for an   sentence, but quickly reassured the court that it should be suspended, ?of course. ? Still, the law is the law. ?He?s demonstrated a manifest intention to violate the law,? Mr. Pr?tre told the court. ?One can criticize it, but it?s got to be applied. ? The verdict, which will be made by the panel of three judges who heard the case this week  ?   there was no jury of peers  ?   is scheduled to be announced on Feb. 10. The appeal for leniency was both an acknowledgment of widespread discomfort with the law, as a well as recognition of Mr. Herrou?s growing status in the region around Nice and its mountainous backcountry, the Roya Valley. Mr. Herrou was voted ?Azur?en of the Year? last month by the readers of the leading local newspaper,   to the fury of regional officials. ?I am C?dric,? read one of the placards in the crowd. ?Long live the righteous of the Roya,? read another. The courtroom on Wednesday was filled with people from the mountain  ?   the men bearded and ponytailed, the women in duffel coats  ?   who had come to support Mr. Herrou and who were convinced right was on their side. The notion that Mr. Herrou is trying to uphold what he sees as basic French values, rather than violating the law, is much of the reason he appears to enjoy a considerable measure of popular support. The argument formed the essence of his lawyer?s defense strategy. Remember the last word in the French Republic?s motto, ?Libert?, Egalit?, Fraternit?,? his lawyer, Zia Oloumi, told the court. ?They are saying M. Herrou is endangering the Republic,? Mr. Oloumi told the three judges. ?On the contrary, I think he is defending its values. ?You see, you have got this value, fraternity, and the dictionary is quite clear,? Mr. Oloumi said. ?Think about the impact of your decision on the practical application of the idea of fraternity. ? Mr. Herrou was not making any political points, Mr. Oloumi insisted. He was merely responding to a humanitarian crisis in his own backyard the Roya Valley had become a way station for migrants. The judges did not respond. But the lightness of the sentence called for by Mr. Pr?tre suggested that the concepts invoked by Mr. Oloumi had resonance. Mr. Herrou?s accusers seemed most taken aback by his stubbornness. Not every migrant Mr. Herrou picks up is by the side of the road. He finds many outside the migrant camp across the Italian border at Ventimiglia, looking especially for women and children. The presiding judge, Laurie Duca, reminded him he had first been arrested in August, near his mountainside home at    with a van full of migrants. At that time, the prosecutor released him, suggesting that Mr. Herrou?s humanitarian motivations absolved him. That first arrest was evidently merely a warning. ?After August, you said you knew it was illegal,? Judge Duca remarked in court. No matter. Mr. Herrou persisted, describing his   work to journalists last fall and even occupying a disused summer camp owned by the state railroad when his own modest homestead became overwhelmed. At that point, in   the authorities decided they had had enough of him. ?You were there, and you were extremely active,? the judge said. ?Why so much press?? Mr. Herrou replied, ?It is right that society should know about all this. ? The judge and the prosecutor suggested that this time Mr. Herrou would not get the humanitarian pass he had benefited from previously. The local political establishment is furious with him. ?At the very moment when we need strict controls, Mr. Herrou?s ideological, premeditated actions are a major risk,? Eric Ciotti, the president of the departmental council and a leading   member of Parliament, wrote in  . Mr. Pr?tre, the prosecutor, suggested that Mr. Herrou?s persistence and openness had been his undoing. ?Mr. Herrou acknowledges everything,? Mr. Pr?tre said, with astonishment. ?This trial springs from a communications strategy for a cause that I totally respect. ? And yet, ?this is what he told the police. He said, ?I am violating the law.? But I am the prosecutor. I must defend the law. ?"
17485,Brooks Barnes,8/01/2017,2017,1,entertainment,"LOS ANGELES  ?   It was a surprise photo finish at the weekend box office, with the   drama ?Hidden Figures? and ?Rogue One: A Star Wars Story? each selling an estimated $22 million in tickets at North American theaters. Most analysts had expected ?Rogue One? (Disney) to easily repeat as the No. 1 multiplex attraction. The ?Star Wars? spinoff has now collected about $477. 3 million over four weeks. Overseas, it has taken in another $437 million. But in its first weekend in wide release ?Hidden Figures? (20th Century Fox) about unsung black heroines in the NASA space race of the 1960s, was lifted by strong reviews, an aggressive   marketing campaign that included a   appeal to faith audiences, and attention on Hollywood?s annual awards circuit. Fox said ?Hidden Figures,? directed by Theodore Melfi and starring Octavia Spencer, Taraji P. Henson and Janelle Monÿe, did particularly well in San Francisco, Washington, Chicago and Cleveland. Produced by Chernin Entertainment and Levantine Films for about $25 million, after accounting for tax credits, ?Hidden Figures? received an   grade from ticket buyers in CinemaScore exit polls. The movie was most popular with women (64 percent of the audience) and people over the age of 35 (about 56 percent of attendees). The animated musical ?Sing? (Universal) was next in line, taking in about $20 million, for a   domestic total of $213. 4 million. The weekend?s other new   movie, ?Underworld: Blood Wars? (Sony) only managed $13 million in ticket sales, or nearly 50 percent less than the initial results for its 2012 franchise predecessor. Sony noted that ?Blood Wars? also cost half as much to make  ?   about $35 million  ?   and has already taken in $45 million overseas. Sony also blamed winter storms in the Eastern United States for decreasing turnout. Among specialty releases: ?Manchester by the Sea? (Roadside Attractions) sold about $2. 5 million in tickets in 1, 054 theaters, lifting its total to $34 million ?Patriots Day? (CBS Films and Lionsgate) about the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, had $105, 000 in seven locations, ahead of its nationwide release on Friday."
17389,James Risen and Sheri Fink,6/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"When the United Nations? top   official tried to inspect an infamous prison in Gambia two years ago, officials there denied him access. So he protested all the way up the country?s chain of command. In a tense meeting with members of the cabinet of the country?s autocratic ruler, the United Nations official, Juan E. M?ndez, was again denied, this time with a jeering dismissal. ?They said, ?Why don?t you go to Guantÿnamo instead,?? recalled Mr. Mendez, a former United Nations special rapporteur on torture. In Bahrain, officials were a little more subtle, but the message was the same, as they twice canceled prison inspection visits. ?They said we face the same threats to national security as other countries face,? Mr. Mendez said. ?It was clear they were referring to the United States, and they didn?t feel that they needed to give me access. ? Now, after   Donald J. Trump?s campaign vows to reinstate the sort of torture used in the   war on terrorism  ?   and to fill the Guantÿnamo Bay prison with ?some bad dudes?  ?   human rights experts fear that authoritarian regimes around the world will see it as another green light to carry out their own abuses. A return to such ?enhanced interrogation?  ?   and even to techniques that Mr. Trump has pledged will be ?much worse?  ?   would also send a powerful message just as nations around the world have begun to examine their own past abuses to ensure that they will not be repeated. ?Sometimes we see progress, and then we see ? said Victor   the   of the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims, a   umbrella organization for   groups. ?When the U. S. was engaging in torture, that created an enormous   of the pendulum,? he added. ?There were a lot of officials in other countries during the Bush administration who were saying, ?The Americans are doing it, so why can?t we?? Now, with Trump saying, ?I will bring a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding,? you can imagine how far we could go backwards. ? Nils Melzer, who succeeded Mr. Mendez as the United Nations? special rapporteur on torture in November, warned that if the Trump administration revived the use of torture, the consequences around the world ?would be catastrophic. ? A fragile consensus against torture, said Jos? Miguel Vivanco, the regional director for the Americas for Human Rights Watch, could be shattered ?when you have the White House openly advocating for torture. ? During the campaign, Mr. Trump declared that ?torture works,? and he vowed to ?immediately? reinstate techniques like waterboarding because ?we have to beat the savages? of the Islamic State, who ?deserve? such treatment even if it is fruitless. Since the election, Mr. Trump has indicated that he might be reconsidering his position, citing the firm stance against torture by James N. Mattis, his Pentagon nominee. In an interview with The New York Times in November, Mr. Trump said that he was ?surprised? when Mr. Mattis told him that he opposed torture and instead favored more humane interrogations of prisoners based on rapport building. But Mr. Trump did not close the door entirely. If Americans feel strongly about bringing back waterboarding and other tactics, he said, ?I would be guided by that. ? Nora Sveaass, a psychologist at the University of Oslo and a former member of the United Nations Committee Against Torture, warned that if Mr. Trump revived the use of torture by the United States, it would have a ripple effect around the globe. ?The U. S. is a very strong voice,? Ms. Sveaass said. ?It?s just like putting a bomb into all of those major principles  ?   the absolute prohibition on torture the absolute obligation to provide redress and justice to victims of torture, including rehabilitation the obligation to investigate and hold people to account,? she added. ?If one country such as the U. S. openly torpedoes those principles, you can just forget about asking for compliance from states already challenging the absolute prohibition. ? The signal from Mr. Trump that torture is acceptable again comes just as countries from Argentina to Tunisia, either through courts or special truth commissions, are engaged in tentative efforts to hold themselves accountable for past conduct. In Argentina, Omar Graffigna, the    former chief of the country?s air force, was sentenced to prison in September for the 1978 kidnapping and torture of two   activists, Patricia Roisinblit and Jos? Manuel P?rez Rojo. The prosecution of Mr. Graffigna was just one in a series of old cases that have been brought into the courts this year in Argentina, as the nation comes to grips with the legacy of its ?dirty war? of the 1970s and early 1980s. In Tunisia, a new Truth and Dignity Commission held its first hearings in November, allowing torture victims to tell their harrowing stories before a national television audience. The commission was created to investigate torture and other human rights violations dating to 1955, primarily by the regime of President Zine   Ben Ali, who was deposed during the Arab Spring in 2011. And in December, Bolivia?s legislature voted to create a truth commission to investigate torture, murders and other crimes committed by a series of authoritarian regimes from 1964 to 1982. Even in countries that have not conducted such   investigations, new     organizations have begun to take root, and those groups are trying to make it more difficult for their governments to continue to engage in torture with secrecy and impunity. Samuel Herbert Nsubuga, the chief executive of the African Center for Treatment and Rehabilitation of Torture Victims, based in Uganda, said   legislation that the country passed in 2012 had still not been put into effect. When the law finally takes effect, ?our challenge will be to bring some people to trial in Uganda for torture,? he said. In the meantime, his group has enlisted doctors and psychologists to provide medical help and therapy to torture victims, as well as lawyers to provide legal advice. But the moves toward examining past abuses are so far limited to relatively small nations or countries where the focus is on historical events rather than the current use of torture. The inquiries are also often being conducted in the face of strong resistance from top government officials, who oppose aggressive investigations even of past crimes. Those modest efforts could face sharp setbacks if Mr. Trump brings back banned practices. ?I am afraid that Trump?s government will question the basic values of the international order, and torturing people will be justified,? said Carlos Jibaja, a psychologist with CAPS, a group in Lima, Peru, that helps victims of torture. At the same time, Mr. Trump?s advocacy of torture may encourage some major countries, like Russia and the Philippines, to be even more open and aggressive in their use of torture. Olga Sadovskaya, the vice chairwoman of the Committee Against Torture, a human rights group in Russia, said that torture was already common in the country. She noted that Russian prison and police officials routinely used torture tactics with cruel nicknames, such as the ?President Putin,? which involves attaching wires from an office telephone to a victim?s body and then running electric current through it. The police like that tactic, she said, because it does not leave marks. Edeliza Hernandez, the executive director of the Medical Action Group in the Philippines, an organization that documents cases of torture and provides treatment and rehabilitation, estimated that there were 200 political prisoners in detention centers in the country, and said that most of them had been tortured. ?The government has soldiers watch us while we inspect prisoners,? she said. Mr. Melzer, the United Nations official, warned that if Mr. Trump followed through on his pledges, more countries would follow his lead and get back into the torture business. ?What kind of message would that be to the world?? Mr. Melzer asked. ?It couldn?t be worse. What happens to the role of the United States as an example in the world, and what would that mean for the policies of other states? If the United States does it, those other countries will know they can get away with it. The last thing the world needs is a U. S. president legitimizing this. ?"
17893,Anne Barnard and Hwaida Saad,3/02/2017,2017,2,politics,"ASTANA, Kazakhstan  ?   The first    meeting between Syrian rebel fighters and government officials in nearly six years of civil war ended abruptly on Monday when diplomatic talks quickly devolved into harsh words and competing accusations. The new round of talks arranged by Russia and Turkey in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan, was meant to showcase Moscow?s increasingly dominant role in the diplomacy and its new understanding with the Turkish government, a leading sponsor of the rebels. But the Syrian delegations almost immediately began arguing and refused to negotiate directly. Mohammad   of the Army of Islam, in his opening statement, labeled the government ?a bloody despotic regime? backed by ?vengeful sectarian militias,? and called for it to release what he said were 13, 000 women being held as political prisoners and to end starvation sieges. That led to a heated exchange around a large circular table that forced Kazakh officials to call for calm, several participants said. The lead government negotiator, Bashar   speaking to reporters after the opening session, responded by calling the opposition delegation ?armed terrorist groups,? and accused them of ?impertinent? and ?provocative? behavior. The tension demonstrated the challenges that remain for Russia, the Syrian government?s most powerful backer, as the Russian government tries to show its approach can accomplish more than the largely fruitless efforts led in past years by the United States and the United Nations. Expectations for progress had been low. Many diplomats and analysts say the more meaningful talks are those that have been held in recent months, largely in secret, among Russia, Turkey and Iran. The meeting in Astana, meant to send the message that Russia would seek to resolve the conflict in its sphere of influence, was markedly different from the United   talks that have taken place  in recent winters in Geneva. Delegates crisscrossed the towering atrium of the Rixos Hotel in the remote Kazakh capital built 20 years ago on the orders of Nursultan Nazarbayev, the former Communist boss who has been the country?s president since it became independent with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. He has a reputation as a pragmatic strongman and enjoys good relations with Russia and Turkey. Palm trees planted indoors belied the subzero temperatures and blowing snow outside, as a    duo wearing evening gowns played ?Strangers in the Night? and the theme from ?Titanic. ? Western diplomats, largely sidelined, huddled in the hotel?s Irish pub, and the United States ambassador to Kazakhstan, who was invited over Iran?s objections and attended only as an observer, avoided reporters. When the Americans had participated in previous rounds of talks in Geneva, the meetings took place at the Palace of Nations, one of the stolid lakeside edifices built in the first half of the 20th century that have housed the United Nations since it was formed after World War II. Those buildings symbolized a postwar order that tried to institutionalize human rights and the laws of war, an order associated with American leadership  ?   or domination  ?   amid the tensions of the Cold War. Now, the role of the United States in Syria and across the Middle East is widely seen as having receded under former President Barack Obama, and its future remains uncertain. Mr. Obama, while backing some rebel groups, resisted deeper American involvement in the Syrian conflict, ceding the leading role to Russia. His successor, President Trump, has signaled broad approval of Russian leadership and policies and sent mixed messages on Syria. Officially, all sides in the Syrian conflict describe the goal of the talks in Astana as reaffirming a tenuous   in order to revive the Geneva talks. The   started in December and known formally as a cessation of hostilities, is largely ignored in many parts of the country and excludes jihadist groups, including the Levant Conquest Front and the Islamic State. A strengthening of the cessation across Syria, the United Nations envoy Staffan de Mistura said Monday, could pave the way for discussion of more substantive political issues at talks scheduled for February in Geneva. The United Nations initially resisted anything more than an observer role in the talks in Astana, but Mr. de Mistura at the last minute agreed to act as a mediator and was shuttling between the delegations who were in separate rooms. Western diplomats were also watching warily to see whether the talks in Astana could be a Russian effort to ultimately replace the Geneva discussions, which the Russian government has criticized. The Syrian government and the Russians have long argued that the Geneva framework, calling for a transitional body with full governing powers, does not require President Bashar   to step down, while the opposition has insisted that it does. But as a practical matter, an increasing number of Western countries, including the United States, and even some of the rebels? backers in the Middle East, like Turkey, have moved toward the Russian position. With Turkey mainly concerned about checking Kurdish militants within its borders and in Syria, and the United States focused on battling Islamic State militants, they have stopped pushing loudly for Mr. Assad to step down ahead of a settlement, instead signaling that they could accept some role for him in a transitional political arrangement. There were signs on Monday of Russian willingness to apply pressure on the Syrian government to keep the talks on track. The tense exchanges in Astana were followed by a Russian statement unusually critical of the Syrian government: The   news agency RIA Novosti said monitors of a   in Syria were ?particularly concerned about sporadic violations of truce by the Syrian government forces?  ?   echoing a complaint of rebels. Russia?s   air campaign, which began in the fall of 2015, helped forces loyal to Mr. Assad drive rebels from their foothold late last year in half of the important city of Aleppo, an offensive criticized by the opposition for indiscriminate air and artillery attacks on civilians. Some rebel groups also shelled civilians in   areas. Now one of the main battles is over Wadi Barada, a besieged   area in the watershed that provides most of the drinking water for Damascus, the Syrian capital. Water supplies have been cut off for weeks, with the government blaming rebels and rebels blaming the government. Mr. Jaafari, the chief Syrian government negotiator and his country?s envoy to the United Nations, was incensed that Mr. Alloush, the rebel representative, had sounded the alarm over the plight of people in Wadi Barada. He said raising concerns about government attacks on Wadi Barada was tantamount to defending the Nusra Front, the former name of the Levant Conquest Front, which is excluded from the  . Residents and rebel fighters in Wadi Barada say that some Nusra fighters are present, but they are a minority among other rebel groups and civilians. Mr. Jaafari said that rebel groups had ?misunderstood? the terms of the   adding, ?We had guarantees from their guarantors that they would behave, but they did not behave. ? Fares Bayoush, a negotiator from an   rebel group who defected from the Syrian Army, said, ?He is the one who misunderstood. ?"
18019,Justin Wolfers,30/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"Even if President Trump?s      fails over the long run to create jobs or prevent companies from moving offshore, there?s a good chance that it will appear, at first, to be a success. But this is a dangerous illusion, the result of companies responding strategically to the new president?s threats. And it could lead to more bad policy if voters or policy makers draw the wrong conclusions. That?s why it?s important to understand precisely how these new policies are likely to shape the numbers over the next few years. Some simple economics can help. Mr. Trump has taken to Twitter to name and shame manufacturing firms planning to relocate some of their production lines overseas. His attacks on Carrier, on Toyota, on General Motors have made their chief executives squirm and, in some cases, have produced what appear to be results. Carrier, for instance, has promised to keep some of the jobs it had planned to send offshore in the United States. Other companies have recycled old announcements of their domestic expansion plans. At first glance, pressuring a handful of companies seems unlikely to have much impact in an economy as large as that of the United States. Imagine that you are a chief executive of a company that has not been a Trump target there are so many companies in the country that the risk of yours being denounced by the president is tiny. At least that?s what the math shows. But the psychological reality is very different. Research has shown that people often overreact to insignificant risks, especially when the risks are so vivid. Just as it is almost certain that you won?t get eaten by a shark this summer, it is a near certainty that the vast majority of companies won?t end up in Mr. Trump?s cross hairs. Yet the fears persist, and people take greater precautionary measures than the actual threat warrants. Moreover, Mr. Trump is targeting the asset that corporate bosses tend to protect most jealously: their personal reputation. Which makes them edgy. So far, the evidence bears this out. There are plenty of anecdotes suggesting that Mr. Trump has executives running scared. Some are hiring communications and crisis managers. Few have been willing to announce the sort of plant closings that might put them in the harsh glare of the president?s spotlight. But this doesn?t mean that Mr. Trump?s tweets have saved jobs. At least not in a lasting sense. To see why not, put yourself in the shoes of a C. E. O. You?re not just deciding whether to send production offshore you also need to decide when to act. This gives you a relatively cheap way to avoid the president?s ire: Mothball your blueprints for the new overseas factory, but don?t burn them. When the political threat passes  ?   and, eventually, it will  ?   just dust them off and move. If enough companies follow this script over the next couple of years, the number of factory jobs in the United States should stabilize, or even rise. Mr. Trump?s eventual successor may well inherit a manufacturing sector that is superficially stronger, though it will hide an underlying weakness: thousands of C. E. O.s ready to move production offshore. As soon as Mr. Trump leaves the stage, several years worth of   demand for offshoring may erupt, and as these plans are followed and factory jobs return to more normal levels, expect a sharp drop in manufacturing employment. Now imagine what all this will look like to a future policy wonk. Manufacturing jobs seemed to be scarce before Mr. Trump?s tenure, improved while he was at the helm, and then shrank sharply as soon as he left office. It might seem as though his angry tweets actually caused manufacturing to thrive. But it would be a mistake to infer that businesses really perform better when threatened. Rather, the fluctuating jobs numbers reflect the ease with which cuts can be delayed, not prevented. Sure, a delay is, in itself, good news for factory workers who keep their jobs a little longer, but it doesn?t address their   problems. Indeed, many economists, both Democrat and Republican, fear that Mr. Trump?s policy of naming and shaming will hurt the manufacturing sector in the long run. After all, the point of the exercise is to allocate workers and machines based on presidential diktat, not market forces. He is pushing corporate leaders to please the White House, rather than their customers and shareholders. The cost of hiring crisis managers to deal with Mr. Trump raises the cost of doing business just as surely as a tax hike would. By making it more expensive to leave the market, he also creates a disincentive for foreign companies thinking of building plants in the United States. The difficulty with trying to use the bully pulpit to create a lasting change in corporate behavior is that words  ?   even a president?s  ?   don?t much alter a company?s bottom line. Corporate decisions are driven by the balance of costs and benefits, and the benefits of offshoring are typically large and enduring. Still, for short periods, even relatively minor incentive shifts can cause large reactions when what is involved is merely a delay, not fundamental change. For example, imagine two people who love Cancn and have decided to vacation there if the cost of a flight rises by $100, they will go anyway, because the cost isn?t enough to deter them. But if the airfare rises by $100 on Sunday, the day they had planned to go, but was to remain at the original price on Monday, the travelers may well decide to wait a day. So fewer people may fly to Mexico on the weekend, when it?s more expensive, yet there will be no   impact on travel. Temporary policies often look as though they have disproportionately large effects, but they aren?t meaningful. That is the odd truth here: Mr. Trump?s approach may appear to have had a big effect precisely because it?s not viewed as a permanent solution. In fact, the more temporary his   industrial policy is thought to be, the more likely it is that chief executives will delay job cuts until the climate changes. Perhaps corporate bosses are currently pliant because they expect that this storm will pass. But bad economics can be good politics. We may see some spectacular   effects, even if Mr. Trump undermines the   competitiveness of America?s factories. The political upside will be obvious in the monthly employment numbers, while the economic downside will be difficult to disentangle from the   trend of declining factory jobs. Yet we shouldn?t be deluded. C. E. O.s will ultimately move jobs abroad if that?s what it takes to churn out profits."
18068,"David Streitfeld, Mike Isaac and Katie Benner",31/01/2017,2017,1,entertainment,"SAN FRANCISCO  ?   On Friday morning, Silicon Valley was largely ambivalent about President Trump. The software programmers, marketing experts and chief executives might not have voted for him, but they were hopeful about finding common ground with the new administration. By Saturday night, much of that optimism had yielded to anger and determination. Mr. Trump?s executive order late on Friday temporarily blocked all refugees while also denying entry to citizens of Iran, Iraq and five other predominantly Muslim countries. The directives struck at the heart of Silicon Valley?s cherished values, its fabled history and, not least, its    approach to customers. Two worldviews collided: the mantra of globalization that underpins the advance of technology and the nationalistic agenda of the new administration. In response, a significant part of the tech community went to the barricades. Netflix?s chief executive, Reed Hastings, wrote on Facebook that Mr. Trump?s actions ?are so   it pains us all? and that ?it is time to link arms together to protect American values of freedom and opportunity. ? Brian Chesky, the chief executive of Airbnb, made the same point. ?We must stand with those who are affected,? he wrote on Twitter. Sergey Brin, a Google founder who immigrated from the Soviet Union when he was 6, seemed to take that suggestion literally, attending an impromptu protest on Saturday evening at San Francisco International Airport. When some of the demonstrators realized that the   man in America was with them, they asked for selfies. He   obliged. ?I?m here because I?m a refugee,? Mr. Brin said, according to a Twitter post by the Forbes writer Ryan Mac. The tech companies? reaction was more forceful than that of other industries. Just about everyone in Silicon Valley came from somewhere else or is a son or daughter of someone who did or is married to someone who did. That list starts with the most famous Silicon Valley citizen of all: Steve Jobs, the Apple   whose biological father immigrated from Syria in 1954. Mr. Trump?s order proclaimed that ?the entry of nationals of Syria as refugees is detrimental to the interests of the United States? and would be suspended indefinitely. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook?s chief executive, said that his   had come from Germany, Austria and Poland and that the parents of his wife, Priscilla Chan, were refugees from China and Vietnam. ?Like many of you, I??m concerned about the impact of the recent executive orders signed by President Trump,? Mr. Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook on Friday. Even some of those working closely with the Trump administration were critical. Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX, who sits on two of Mr. Trump?s advisory committees, wrote on Twitter that the ban was ?not the best way to address the country?s challenges. ? Mr. Musk was born in South Africa. Aaron Levie, chief executive of the data storage company Box, wrote on Twitter that ?on every level  ?   moral, humanitarian, economic, logical, etc.  ?   this ban is wrong and is completely antithetical to the principles of America. ? Over all, Mr. Levie said in an interview, ?there was a pretty resounding response from the tech industry showing how unacceptable this is. ? Beyond family heritage and employment, he noted, Silicon Valley cares about immigration because its companies strive to operate everywhere in the world. ?Almost every company?s products  ?   Google, Apple, Airbnb  ?   has a global customer base,? Mr. Levie said. ?These policy decisions have real implications to our partners, our customers, our competitors. ? The Trump administration is little more than a week old, but its relationship with Silicon Valley is already complicated. The tech industry did not like Mr. Trump the presidential candidate, despite his embrace of Twitter, and he returned the sentiment with caustic posts on the platform. Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist, said in 2015 that ?  or   of the C. E. O.s in Silicon Valley are from South Asia or from Asia,? an incorrect statement that many in Silicon Valley perceived as racist. Yet a   December meeting between the incoming administration and numerous tech chieftains was decidedly upbeat. ?We?re going to be there for you,? Mr. Trump promised to a room that included the leaders of Apple, Microsoft and Amazon. By early last week, the companies sensed trouble. Murtadha   24, an   software engineer at Facebook, was told by a company lawyer on Tuesday that he needed to cut short a visit to Canada and return to the United States. The company feared that he would not be readmitted to the country because the president was expected to sign an executive order that would keep him out. ?It may be my na?vet? about how politics and industries interact, but I don?t interpret the tech community?s opposition to the president as a political stance,? Mr. Tameemi said. ?It seemed more like a matter of values and a matter that impacts them. ? The larger tech companies tended to be less forceful in their reactions to the executive order than the smaller ones. Google said it was ?concerned. ? Apple said, ?It is not a policy we support. ? Amazon said only that it was committed to diversity. Oracle did not respond to requests for comment. On the other hand, Microsoft became more forceful as the weekend went on. On Saturday, its executives talked mostly about the virtues of immigration. On Sunday night, the company issued a statement calling the executive order ?misguided and a fundamental step backwards? and said it would create ?collateral damage to the country?s reputation and values. ? Microsoft was not the only company to become bolder in a few hours. Around 10 a. m. on Saturday, Mr. Chesky of Airbnb posted a vague message on Twitter saying ?open doors bring all of US together. ? By 6 p. m. he was advocating open protest. Early Sunday morning, he wrote a memo to employees warning that Mr. Trump?s new policy was ?a direct obstacle to our mission. ? It was a long, dizzying day for an industry that is struggling to find its footing under the new president. ?It feels like the air itself has changed, like when a storm comes,? said Shervin Pishevar, a founder of Sherpa Capital and Hyperloop One. Even before the executive order, pressure had been building on companies to speak out against measures being endorsed by Mr. Trump. Some of that impetus came from employees, and some from activists. Engineers and product managers at several tech companies spoke to The New York Times on the condition of anonymity. They have signed nondisclosure agreements at their companies and are generally not authorized to speak to the news media. At Twitter, a number of workers felt frustrated with the disconnect between their company?s product  ?   a platform for free speech  ?   and the extent to which Mr. Trump has used it to attack those who question him and proclaim outright falsehoods to the American public. On Saturday, Jack Dorsey, Twitter?s chief executive, posted and reposted numerous messages denouncing the travel ban. At Facebook, employees felt a similar sense of discord. Some complained about how long it took Mr. Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer, to speak out. Others were upset at the continued presence of Peter Thiel, a venture capitalist and a longtime confidant of Mr. Zuckerberg?s, as a director on Facebook?s board. Mr. Thiel was a donor to Mr. Trump??s campaign and has since become an adviser, and he issued a statement on Saturday evening that reaffirmed his support for the president. Uber is under one of the brightest spotlights. Travis Kalanick, its chief executive, is part of Mr. Trump?s economic advisory team. That has made Uber a target of protesters, some of whom shut down access to its headquarters on Inauguration Day. In an email to employees on Saturday titled ?Standing up for what?s right,? Mr. Kalanick stressed the importance of pushing for change by working to have a seat at the table and discussing any differences. He said he would be seeing Mr. Trump on Friday. As protesters at Kennedy International Airport in New York multiplied on Saturday night, cabdrivers  ?   largely immigrants  ?   began a   work stoppage at the airport as a form of protest against the executive order. Uber did not follow suit. Instead, it posted on Twitter that it was suspending surge pricing at Kennedy Airport. That prompted accusations that it was trying to break the strike, which the company awkwardly denied in another Twitter post. On Sunday morning, its competitor Lyft said it was donating $1 million to the American Civil Liberties Union over the next four years ?to defend our Constitution. ? On Sunday afternoon, Uber sharpened its criticism of the ban, calling it ?wrong and unjust. ? Sam Altman, who runs Y Combinator, Silicon Valley?s most prominent   incubator, said things were changing so fast that it was hard to predict what was going to happen. ?After the election, a lot of people here said give Trump a chance in good faith, and after he started, a lot of people said give him a chance in good faith,? Mr. Altman said. ?Now they are looking at his policies and saying he is a risk to the republic. Saturday was a good beginning, and I think there is more to come. ? Mr. Altman spoke as he was arriving at the airport in San Francisco on Saturday at 10:30 p. m. The protest was continuing, and he intended to join."
17971,Julia Preston,15/02/2017,2017,2,entertainment,"Janet Napolitano, president of the University of California, knows exactly what?s at stake if President Trump shuts down an Obama administration program that has given work permits and protection from deportation to some 752, 000 young undocumented immigrants. In 2012, in her previous job as secretary of Homeland Security, she signed the document  ?   nothing more than a policy memo  ?   that created the program. So when alarm spread among immigrants on college campuses following Mr. Trump?s election, Ms. Napolitano moved quickly to determine what the California system could do to shelter its students if he carried through on his pledges to cancel the program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. The university estimates that almost 3, 800 among its 190, 000 students are undocumented, many but not all with DACA. Ms. Napolitano, retaining her law enforcement instincts, does not mention the word ?sanctuary? when describing what the university could offer. ?Sanctuary is such a vague term, we don?t use it,? she said crisply. Instead, the university has published detailed principles of support for undocumented students, including assurances that campus police would not question students solely about their immigration status or join any cooperation agreements with federal immigration authorities under the Trump administration. Through the Davis campus law school, the university is organizing legal help for students detained for deportation. Another worrisome prospect, Ms. Napolitano said, is that students could lose the permits that allow them to work. Undocumented students, including any losing DACA, will continue to pay   tuition and be eligible for state financial aid and for a revolving loan program funded, in part, by the university. ?We want to do everything we can so students are safe on our campuses,? Ms. Napolitano said, ?so they can focus on what they are there to do, which is to study. ? Students at dozens of college campuses, galvanized by Mr. Trump?s depictions of immigrants as criminals or potential terrorists, have pressed administrators to provide sanctuary for those without legal papers. But universities have had differing ideas about what that would mean in practice, and most leaders have been careful to say they would not defy the law. Some institutions have flatly rejected sanctuary plans as encouraging lawbreaking. At New Mexico State University, the president, Garrey Carruthers, said that banning federal agents from campus might imperil its federal funding. One of the first presidents to declare a sanctuary campus explicitly was Michael S. Roth of Wesleyan, who announced in November that it ?will not voluntarily assist? any efforts by federal authorities to deport students (a policy he reaffirmed on Jan. 29). Soon after, John Coatsworth, the provost of Columbia University, said that it would not allow immigration agents on campus without a warrant. Some administrators point out that student information, including their immigration status, is already protected under   privacy laws requiring the authorities to show a warrant or court order before any data can be released without students? consent. In Georgia, Emory, which is a private university, considered but ultimately decided against protective measures. ?Emory is not seeking to establish itself as a sanctuary campus, for which there is no legal definition,? the university said in a Jan. 4 statement. Taking a tougher line, the University System of Georgia said that any call for sanctuary was ?unacceptable? and added, ?We expect our institutions to follow the law. ? In his first formal briefing, on Jan. 23, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, suggested that canceling DACA would not be a priority for the new administration, but he did not provide any explicit reassurance that the program would continue. Ms. Napolitano is still contemplating the bitter possibility that Mr. Trump will sweep away her most significant immigration accomplishment. She hopes to persuade him that the program is a good use of executive power, emphasizing that DACA immigrants pose little security risk because they pass background checks to get into the program. Her message for Mr. Trump: ?Why waste resources trying to deport good students who?ve done everything right??"
18289,Robert Pear,4/02/2017,2017,2,lifestyle,"WASHINGTON  ?   The number of people who signed up for health insurance in the federal marketplace that serves most states dipped this year to 9. 2 million, the Trump administration said Friday, as consumers struggled with confusion over the future of the Affordable Care Act. That represents a decline of more than 4 percent from the total of 9. 63 million people who signed up through HealthCare. gov at this time last year. The numbers do not include activity in the 11 states that run their own online marketplaces under the Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obama?s signature health care law. State reports suggest that they have signed up about three million people. Veterans of the Obama administration said President Trump?s opposition to the health law and his efforts to undermine it had taken a toll. People may also have been influenced by signals from Congress that the law would soon be repealed. And some consumers may have been put off by the termination of their health plans, which was caused by an exodus of major insurers from the market in many states. Just before leaving office, the Obama administration reported that   through HealthCare. gov were running slightly ahead of the number at the same time last year, with 8. 8 million as of Jan. 14. ?Trump?s sabotage worked,? said Ben Wakana, who was a spokesman for Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services under Mr. Obama. ?We were on track to exceed last year?s total. We expected a million people to sign up on the federal exchange in the final week of the open enrollment period. ? Still, the numbers present a challenge to Republicans who are struggling to repeal the law that allowed those millions to purchase insurance plans  ?   and who have promised not to displace anyone covered by it. The fourth annual open enrollment season began Nov. 1 and ended Tuesday, 11 days after Mr. Trump took office. The Trump administration scaled back publicity and advertising in the final days of the open enrollment period. Mr. Trump also issued a broadly worded executive order that directed federal officials to waive or delay any provision of the Affordable Care Act that would impose ?a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals. ? The order, issued within hours of Mr. Trump?s inauguration on Jan. 20, did not specify what actions would be taken. But lawyers and health policy experts read it as an indication that the government might not enforce the federal requirement for people to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty. Mr. Trump has described the Affordable Care Act as ?a complete and total disaster? and has said he wants to replace it with better, cheaper coverage ?for everybody,? but he has not offered a plan to achieve that goal. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and chairman of the Finance Committee, who is trying to draft a replacement for the law, said that ?today?s numbers failed to keep pace with last year?s. ? In addition, he suggested, some people who signed up will not pay their premiums and will therefore not have coverage this year. ?Either way,? Mr. Hatch said, ?enrollment numbers are down, and costs are up. ? That response was predicted by Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader and an architect of the law. ?Now, Republicans will cynically point to the dip in enrollment they caused, declare the Affordable Care Act broken and move to steal the affordable health coverage of every American,? she said. ?Meanwhile, in states committed to delivering affordable health coverage to their residents, enrollment in the Affordable Care Act?s marketplaces has surged. ? ?Democrats will continue to stand our ground to ensure that every American has access to affordable health coverage,? she added. Enrollment reports from the Obama administration were invariably upbeat, saying the numbers showed that people needed and wanted insurance under the Affordable Care Act. The first report from the Trump administration struck a different tone. ?Obamacare has failed the American people, with one broken promise after another,? Matt Lloyd, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said Friday. ?Premiums in the A. C. A. marketplace have increased 25 percent while the number of insurers has declined 28 percent over the past year. ? Of the 9. 2 million people who signed up through HealthCare. gov,   were new to the federal marketplace, and   were returning customers. The individual insurance market is in constant flux. With changes in income and employment, consumers may gain or lose coverage from Medicaid, employers and other sources of insurance. The Obama administration predicted in October that 13. 8 million people would sign up for coverage in the enrollment period that ended this week. The total appears likely to fall short of that goal. Leslie Dach, a former Obama administration official who is trying to preserve the health law as a leader of the Protect Our Care Coalition, said, ?Enrollment was a success, and it would have been even higher without the Trump administration?s efforts to suppress enrollment. ? Despite those efforts, he said, ?Americans continued to enroll in the final weeks, proving that there is considerable demand for quality and affordable coverage. ? Several states that run their own insurance exchanges appear to have done better than the federal marketplace. In New York, 908, 200 people signed up through the state marketplace for either a qualified health plan or the ?basic health program? authorized by the Affordable Care Act for   people. That represents an increase of 39 percent. Under the Obama administration, enrollment in marketplace insurance plans was consistently lower than the levels originally projected by the Congressional Budget Office, in part because consumers were more likely to get and keep   insurance."
17704,Christopher Clarey,17/01/2017,2017,1,law,"MELBOURNE, Australia  ?   ?So Ivan, are you calling Andy ?Sir??? Ivan Lendl paused and then laughed, which would surely seem strange to those who know him only as Andy Murray?s   coach in the front row of the players? box. ?Definitely not,? Lendl said, chuckling some more before heading off down the crowded main hallway inside Rod Laver Arena at the Australian Open. Clearly, not much has changed in the Murray camp since his remarkable stretch run to the No. 1 ranking and a knighthood in 2016. He is still tough on himself on court and on the changeovers. Still Andy  ?   not Sir Andy  ?   to his peers and mentor in chief, Lendl. Still deadpan and droll with his voice that sounds as if it emanates from a mine shaft. Asked on Monday by the   interviewer John Fitzgerald how Murray?s wife, Kim, was handling the transition to Lady Kim, Murray said, ?No more swearing during my matches, for anyone who saw that a few years ago. ? He was referring to Kim?s courtside language during his semifinal victory over Tomas Berdych at the 2015 Australian Open. Her tirade did not go unnoticed, and she returned for the final cheekily wearing a shirt that read, ?Parental advisory explicit content. ? Presumably, Lady Kim won?t be wearing that sort of thing in the players? box from here on, either (or at least she wasn?t on Monday). ?I haven?t found it distracting really,? Murray said of the knighthood. ?I mean, I found out about it four or five weeks ago. Maybe if it happened a day or so, two days before the tournament. But I?ve had enough time to get my head around it. ? Just as he has had plenty of time to prepare himself for the role of No. 1, however long it lasts. I asked him on Monday, after his stuttering     (5)     victory over Illya Marchenko, if there had been any downside to No. 1, thinking he might bring up extra demands or burdens. ?No,? he said. ?It?s been great. I think because it?s taken me so long to get there, obviously I want to try to stay there. But also I feel like I?m mature enough now to handle it. Maybe if it happens when you?re very young, you might feel extra pressures. The responsibilities might feel a bit much, but I think because I?m much older and more mature, it?s been good. ? The conventional tennis wisdom is that it is harder to hang on at the top than to reach the top. ?I hope not,? Murray said. But for anyone who believes that he now has nowhere to go but down, that is hardly true in Australia. He has reached five singles finals in Melbourne and lost all five. No man has done so well at any Grand Slam tournament without breaking through to win the title. Others have lost five finals in the same major event, including Lendl, who lost five at the United States Open. But he also won three. Bill Johnston lost six finals at the United States Championships, but won the event twice. John Bromwich lost five finals at the Australian Championships in the   era, but won the title twice, too. Murray, at 29, is in unfortunately uncharted territory, all the more so because Novak Djokovic ended his own long run of frustration at the French Open last year by finally taking the title after reaching four semifinals and three finals. ?Look, it?s still a remarkable record, five Slam finals in Australia, and deep down I think it means an enormous amount to Andy to finally complete the puzzle,? said Roger Rasheed, the Australian who once coached Lleyton Hewitt when Hewitt was chasing the title here without success. But Hewitt reached only one final in Melbourne. Murray is   here and has a better winning percentage at the Australian Open than at any other Grand Slam tournament except Wimbledon. ?Andy?s been so close,? Rasheed said. ?What more does he have to do? Well, it?s not a matter of big changes. It?s just been a matter of points and the moments. ? It?s a matter of the opposition, too. The first of Murray?s Australian Open defeats in the final came against Roger Federer in 2010. The last four came against Djokovic in 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2016. ?Andy played Roger in his prime and has been playing Novak in his prime,? Rasheed said. ?It?s a handful of points changing the way the match falls. Andy?s showing he?s in his prime now. He just needs to get there and roll the dice again. ? Murray?s timing may still not be quite right. He played a great deal of tennis down the stretch in 2016 and was beaten by Djokovic in a   final in Doha, Qatar, to start this season. Freshness just might be a factor down the stretch as well as Djokovic?s eagerness to restore the pecking order. But it does not seem quite right in light of their abilities that Djokovic has six Australian Open titles and Murray has not even one. He broke down in tears after losing to Federer in 2010. He stared vacantly into space after losses to Djokovic and sportingly came up with the right words amid major disappointment. And yet he insisted on Monday that his emotions were not mixed when he thought about this tournament. ?Honestly, they?re totally positive,? said Murray, who plays    Andrey Rublev in the second round on Wednesday. ?I?ve had a lot of tough losses here, for sure. But I love it here. Played some great matches as well, but just haven?t managed to win the final. But, you know, I keep coming back to try. I?ll keep doing that until I?m done, but I still feel like I?ve got a few years left to try and do it. ? He is, by any measure, due for a change of fortune in Melbourne. And if you like your sports with foreshadowing, the only other top tennis player to receive a knighthood was Sir Norman Brookes, the Australian star of the early 20th century. Guess whose name has been given to the trophy awarded to the men?s champion at the Australian Open?"
17404,Mitch Smith and Niraj Chokshi,5/01/2017,2017,1,crime,"CHICAGO  ?   The police here were questioning four people on Wednesday as video circulated online showing a white teenager tied up and beaten as a group of young   shouted antiwhite messages and insulted   Donald J. Trump. ?It?s sickening,? Superintendent Eddie Johnson of the Chicago Police Department said. ?It makes you wonder, what would make individuals treat somebody like that?? The police said the victim was an    man from suburban Chicago who had ?mental health challenges? and who had been reported missing. Officers spotted him on Tuesday in a violent neighborhood on Chicago?s West Side and recognized that he was in distress, the police said. They sought treatment for him at a hospital and connected the beating to four people who were taken into custody later that day near where the bloodied man had been found. A roughly   video clip shared widely online appeared to show a Facebook livestream of the assault. A group can be seen taunting and physically assaulting a man amid cursing and laughing. Much of the video focuses on one woman as she rambles, at times incoherently. The video begins with a shot of that woman before turning to the victim, who is seated in the corner of a room with his mouth covered. The woman laughs as two men cut the sleeve of the victim?s shirt. One of the men yells epithets about Mr. Trump and ?white people. ? Later, a man cuts a patch of hair from the victim?s head, appearing to draw blood in the process. Mr. Johnson said criminal charges against the suspects, two men and two women, could be announced on Thursday. Investigators said they were not yet sure of a motive, but could pursue hate crime and kidnapping charges if the evidence warranted. The victim knew one of his attackers, the police said, and had been taken from the suburbs to the city and held for some time before the beating was streamed online. ?Images in the video put on display the brazenness of the offenders who assaulted the victim and then broadcast it for the entire world to see,? Mr. Johnson said. The victim, whom the police did not name, was hospitalized for undisclosed injuries, but had been released by Wednesday evening and was speaking with investigators. The police said he was ?traumatized? and initially had trouble communicating with detectives. The video?s spread online comes at a time of relentless violence in Chicago. In a Twitter post this week, Mr. Trump cited Chicago?s 762 murders last year and suggested that the city should seek federal help if local efforts to control the violence continued to be ineffective. Superintendent Johnson declined to speculate on whether the  ?s Twitter message and the videotaped beating were connected."
17302,The Associated Press,3/01/2017,2017,1,crime,"BAGHDAD  ?   A suicide bomber detonated a pickup truck loaded with explosives on Monday in a busy Baghdad market, killing at least 36 people hours after President Fran?ois Hollande of France arrived in the Iraqi capital. The Islamic State later claimed responsibility for the attack. The bomb went off in a produce market that was packed with day laborers, a police officer said, adding that another 52 people were wounded. During a news conference with Mr. Hollande, Haider   Iraq?s prime minister, said the suicide bomber had pretended to be a man seeking to hire day laborers. Once the workers gathered around, he detonated the vehicle. The Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, claimed the attack in a statement circulated on a website that is often used by the group. It was the third such attack in three days in or near Baghdad, underscoring the lingering threat posed by the extremist group despite a string of setbacks for it elsewhere in the country over the past year, including in and around the northern city of Mosul. The attack took place in Sadr City, a vast Shiite district in eastern Baghdad that has been repeatedly targeted by Sunni extremists since the 2003   invasion. Militiamen loyal to the Shiite cleric Moktada   were seen evacuating bodies in their trucks before ambulances arrived. Bodies were scattered across the bloody pavement alongside fruit, vegetables and laborers? shovels and axes. A minibus filled with dead passengers was on fire. Asaad Hashim, 28, an owner of a nearby cellphone store, described how the laborers had pushed and shoved around the bomber?s vehicle, trying to get hired. ?Then a big boom came, sending them up into the air,? said Mr. Hashim, who suffered shrapnel wounds to his right hand. He blamed ?the most ineffective security forces in the world? for failing to prevent the attack. An angry crowd cursed the government, even after a representative of Mr. Sadr tried to calm them. Late last month, the Iraqi authorities started removing some of the security checkpoints in Baghdad in a bid to ease traffic for the capital?s six million residents. ?We have no idea who will kill at any moment and who?s supposed to protect us,? said Ali Abbas, a    father of four who was hurled over his vegetable stand by the blast. ?If the securities forces can?t protect us, then allow us to do the job. ? Several smaller bombings elsewhere in the city on Monday killed at least 20 civilians and wounded at least 70, according to medics and police officials. All officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to reporters. The United States State Department condemned the attacks. Separately, the American military announced on Monday the death of a coalition service member in Iraq in a ?  incident,? without providing further details. Mr. Hollande met with Mr. Abadi and President Fuad Masum, and later traveled to the   northern Kurdish region to meet with French troops and local officials. He pledged to help displaced Iraqis return to Mosul, where Iraqi forces are waging a large offensive against the Islamic State. France is part of the   coalition formed in 2014 to fight the Islamic State after the extremist group seized large areas in Iraq and neighboring Syria. France has suffered multiple attacks claimed by the extremist group."
17605,Rosie Schaap,9/01/2017,2017,1,lifestyle,"I?m always thrilled when a certain former drinking buddy comes to see me at the bar. He stopped drinking alcohol years ago, but he?s as fun to be around as he was when we sat side by side at a corner bar in TriBeCa many nights in the ?90s  ?   probably more so. Quitting drinking, whether it?s for a month (as many are tempted to do this time of year) or forever, shouldn?t have to mean forgoing all the other, and arguably deeper, pleasures of bar culture: community and conversation. Of course it?s easier  ?   and maybe economically sounder  ?   to drink at home, but we go to bars because other people are there, and the fellowship we find with them is, for many of us, more important than the pints and shots. I want my friend to be as happy and relaxed at the bar as any other customer, and he deserves something better than a cranberry and seltzer. Given the limited resources at my small, neighborhood pub, a virgin bloody mary usually does the trick  ?   and mixed with a good nonalcoholic beer, it makes an excellent base for a virgin michelada, too. Cocktail and restaurant bars are also making a greater effort to make nondrinkers feel welcome and well looked after. Some have dedicated nonalcoholic drink menus. On the list at Boston?s Bar Mezzana is a festive number called the Orchid Thief, fragrant with orange and tinged with vanilla, fizzed up with club soda and served in a flute  ?   a celebratory glassful of   bubbly. Abigail Gullo at Comp?re Lapin in New Orleans gladly accommodates nondrinkers with a cooler composed of fresh blackberries, citrus juices and orgeat, an almondy syrup that hints at the flavor of amaretto. Another creative bartender, the Los   Gabriella Mlynarczyk, has deliberately developed recipes that are delicious and satisfying with or without alcohol. One is the Mumbai Mule, for which she concocts a spicy syrup of ginger, turmeric, coriander, cumin, paprika, cayenne and honey. She then mixes it with coconut milk, tops it off with ginger beer and garnishes it with fresh curry leaves. Part of the appeal of sitting at a bar with a cocktail is that it?s an opportunity to sip something special, unusual and lovely to behold. The three options featured here succeed in all these criteria. But let?s not call them mocktails  ?   they?re not mocking anything. They stand on their own flavorful merits. In bartending circles, there has always been discussion about the pressure to drink and the toll it can take. It?s an important conversation, and my sense is that in recent years it has become more open and more honest.

17764,Choe Sang-Hun,11/03/2017,2017,3,business,"SEOUL, South Korea  ?   A South Korean court on Thursday blocked a prosecutor?s attempt to arrest Jay Y. Lee, the leader of Samsung, saying there was not enough evidence that Mr. Lee had bribed President Park   in a scandal that led to her impeachment. A justice on the Central District Court in Seoul, Cho   rejected the prosecutor?s request to issue an arrest warrant, saying said it was ?difficult to recognize the need? to incarcerate Mr. Lee. Mr. Lee, a   scion and vice chairman of Samsung, one of the world?s biggest conglomerates, was immediately released from a detention center outside Seoul, where he had been waiting for the court to decide whether he should be formally arrested. South Koreans have paid keen attention to the fate of Mr. Lee. Some analysts said his case was a test of whether the country?s relatively youthful democracy and judicial system are ready to crack down on the   crimes of   conglomerates. No Samsung leader has ever been jailed, though the company has been investigated many times for corruption. The court?s decision is likely to anger many South Koreans who have held weekend rallies calling for Ms. Park?s ouster and the arrest of business tycoons on corruption charges. The special prosecutor called the court decision ?very regrettable. ? But he has yet to announce whether he will offer more evidence in a renewed effort to have Mr. Lee arrested. He can also indict Mr. Lee on bribery or lesser charges without arresting him. ?We will take necessary steps and persist in our investigation without wavering,? said Lee   a spokesman for the special prosecutor, without elaborating. Samsung welcomed the court?s decision. For now, the ruling allows Mr. Lee to continue to lead Samsung. It dealt a blow to the special prosecutor who had tried to build a bribery case against Mr. Lee and Ms. Park. Mr. Lee?s father has twice been convicted of bribery and tax evasion but has never spent a day in prison. Each time, he received a presidential pardon and returned to management. Mr. Lee, 48, was accused of paying $36 million to Ms. Park?s secretive confidante, Choi  . The special prosecutor and Mr. Lee?s lawyers have been arguing over how to characterize the money. In November, state prosecutors indicted Ms. Choi on extortion charges, saying she leveraged her connections with Ms. Park to coerce Samsung and scores of other big businesses to contribute tens of millions of dollars to two foundations Ms. Choi controlled or to companies run by her or her associates. They identified Ms. Park as an accomplice, but they brought no charges against the businesses, which they saw as victims of extortion. But the special prosecutor, Park   who took over the investigation from state prosecutors last month, has called Samsung?s contributions bribes that were exchanged for political favors from Ms. Park. That includes government support for a merger of two Samsung affiliates in 2015, which helped Mr. Lee inherit corporate control from his incapacitated father, the chairman, Lee   according to the prosecutor.   groups accused the prosecutor of overreaching in an attempt to find a   scapegoat to soothe a public infuriated over Ms. Park?s corruption scandal and fed up with decades of collusive ties between the government and the chaebol. Mr. Lee was the most prominent businessman to be ensnared in the special prosecutor?s broadening investigation into the corruption scandal that led to Ms. Park?s impeachment by Parliament last month. Ms. Park?s presidential powers remained suspended, while the Constitutional Court is expected to rule in coming weeks whether she should be reinstated or formally removed from office. ?We have been too lenient toward chaebol corruption,? said Moon   an opposition politician who leads in polls on contenders to replace Ms. Park if she is removed. Speaking to a group of foreign reporters hours before the court?s decision, Mr. Moon said Samsung was typical of a chaebol whose top boss wielded ?imperial powers? over his sprawling business group but was ?seldom held accountable? for corruption or managerial failures. Ms. Park denies any wrongdoing. Mr. Lee and Samsung have also denied bribery they argued that the ?donations? Samsung paid out to Ms. Choi were coerced, not meant as a quid pro quo for political favors from Ms. Park."
17814,David E. Sanger,21/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"WASHINGTON  ?   America, and the world, just found out what ?America First? means. President Trump could have used his inaugural address to define one of the touchstone phrases of his campaign in the most inclusive way, arguing, as did many of his predecessors, that as the world?s greatest superpower rises, its partners will also prosper. Instead, he chose a dark,   alternative, one that appeared to herald the end of a   American experiment to shape a world that would be eager to follow its lead. In Mr. Trump?s vision, America?s new strategy is to win every transaction and confrontation. Gone are the days, he said, when America extended its defensive umbrella without compensation, or spent billions to try to lift the fortune of foreign nations, with no    strategic benefits for the United States. ?From this day forward, it?s going to be only America first,? he said, in a line that resonated around the world as soon as he uttered it from the steps of the Capitol. ?We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs. ? The United States, he said, will no longer subsidize ?the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military. ? While all American presidents pledge to defend America?s interests first  ?   that is the core of the presidential oath  ?   presidents of both parties since the end of World War II have wrapped that effort in an expansion of the liberal democratic order. Until today, American policy has been a complete rejection of the America First rallying cry that the famed flier Charles Lindbergh championed when, in the late 1930s, he became one of the most prominent voices to keep the United States out of Europe?s wars, even if it meant abandoning the country?s closest allies. Mr. Trump has rejected comparisons with the earlier movement, with its taint of Nazism and  . After World War II, the United States buried the Lindbergh vision of America First. The United Nations was born in San Francisco and raised on the East River of Manhattan, an ambitious, if still unfulfilled, experiment in shaping a liberal order. Lifting the vanquished nations of World War II into democratic allies was the idea behind the Marshall Plan, the creation of the World Bank and institutions to spread American aid, technology and expertise around the world. And NATO was created to instill a commitment to common defense, though Mr. Trump has accurately observed that nearly seven decades later, many of its member nations do not pull their weight. Mr. Trump?s defiant address made abundantly clear that his threat to pull out of those institutions, if they continue to take advantage of the United States? willingness to subsidize them, could soon be translated into policy. All those decades of generosity, he said, punching the air for emphasis, had turned America into a loser. ?We?ve made other countries rich,? he said, ?while the wealth, strength and confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon. ? The American middle class has suffered the most, he said, finding its slice of the American dream ?redistributed across the entire world. ? To those who helped build that global order, Mr. Trump?s vow was at best shortsighted. ?Truman and Acheson, and everyone who followed, based our policy on a ?? not an ?? basis,? said Richard N. Haass, whose new book, ?A World in Disarray,? argues that a more granular,   view of American interests will ultimately fail. ?A narrow America First posture will prompt other countries to pursue an equally narrow, independent foreign policy,? he said after Mr. Trump?s speech, ?which will diminish U. S. influence and detract from global prosperity. ? To Mr. Trump and his supporters, it is just that view that put America on the slippery slope to obsolescence. As a builder of buildings, Mr. Trump?s return on investment has been easily measurable. So it is unsurprising that he would grade America?s performance on a scorecard in which he totals up wins and losses. Curiously, among the skeptics are his own appointees. His nominee for defense secretary, Gen. James N. Mattis, strongly defended the importance of NATO during his confirmation hearing. Both Rex W. Tillerson, the nominee for secretary of state, and Nikki R. Haley, the choice for ambassador to the United Nations, offered up paeans to the need for robust American alliances, though Mr. Tillerson periodically tacked back to concepts echoing Mr. Trump?s. And there is a question about whether the exact meaning of America First will continue to evolve in Mr. Trump?s mind. He first talked about it in a March interview with The New York Times, when asked whether that phrase was a good summation of his   views. He thought for a moment. Then he agreed with this reporter?s summation of Mr. Trump?s message that the world had been ?freeloading off of us for many years? and that he fundamentally mistrusted many foreigners, both adversaries and some allies. ?Correct,? he responded. Then he added, in his staccato style: ?Not isolationist. I?m not isolationist, but I am ?America First.? So I like the expression. ? He soon began using it at almost every rally. In another interview with The Times, on the eve of the Republican National Convention, he offered a refinement. He said he did not mean for the slogan to be taken the way Lindbergh meant it. ?It was used as a   very modern term,? he said. ?Meaning we are going to take care of this country first before we worry about everybody else in the world. ? As Walter Russell Mead, a professor at Bard College and a scholar at the conservative Hudson Institute, put it the other day, ?The fact that he doesn?t have a grounding in the prior use of the term is liberating. ? ?If you said to the average American voter, ?Do you think it?s the job of the president to put America first,? they say, ?Yes, that?s the job. ?? But Mr. Mead said that formulation disregarded the reality that ?sometimes to achieve American interests, you have to work cooperatively with other countries. ? And any such acknowledgment was missing from Mr. Trump?s speech on Friday. Mr. Trump cast America?s new role in the world as one of an aggrieved superpower, not a power intent on changing the globe. There was no condemnation of authoritarianism or fascism, no clarion call to defend human rights around the world  ?   one of the commitments that John F. Kennedy made in his famed address, delivered 56 years ago to the day, to protect human rights ?at home and around the world. ? That was, of course, the prelude to Kennedy?s most famous line: that America would ?bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty. ? But the America that elected Mr. Trump had concluded that it was no longer willing to bear that burden  ?   or even to make the spread of democracy the mission of the nation, as George W. Bush, who was sitting behind Mr. Trump, vowed 12 years ago. Mr. Trump views American democracy as a fine import for those who like it. ?We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone,? he said, ?but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to follow. ?"
18284,Simon Romero and Daniel Politi,3/03/2017,2017,3,politics,"BUENOS AIRES  ?   Argentina is so used to celebrating immigration as a cornerstone of society that a   saying  ?   to govern is to populate  ?   remains in use to this day. But in an abrupt shift coinciding with the immigration restrictions put in place by the Trump administration, President Mauricio Macri has issued a decree curbing immigration to Argentina, with his government declaring that newcomers from poorer countries in Latin America bring crime. The measures announced by Mr. Macri in recent days made it much easier to deport immigrants and restrict their entry, prompting irate comparisons to President Trump and igniting a fierce debate over immigration. ?A decree like this scares people,? said Arfang Diedhiou, 33, a Senegalese immigrant who runs his own clothing store here in the capital, Buenos Aires. ?It came out just after what Trump did, a coincidence that seems very strange to me. ? Argentina?s president, the son of an immigrant, has echoed some of Mr. Trump?s ?America First? theme, making it clear that his ?first concern? should be ?caring for Argentines, caring for ourselves. ? ?We cannot continue to allow criminals to keep choosing Argentina as a place to commit offenses,? Mr. Macri said during a news conference. His decree has also rekindled criticism of his ties to the American president, whom he calls a friend. In the 1980s, Mr. Macri worked with his father, an Italian immigrant and industrial magnate, on a real estate project in New York that the family ended up selling to Mr. Trump. Mr. Macri?s immigration measures, while not as   as Mr. Trump?s decision to halt refugees from around the world and freeze visas from seven predominantly Muslim nations, are raising diplomatic tensions in the region. Some South American leaders are attacking what they view as an attempt to mimic Mr. Trump?s immigration policies and nurture xenophobic sentiment. ?Brothers, Latin American presidents, we can?t follow the immigration policies of the North,? President Evo Morales of Bolivia said. But opinion polls in Argentina showed widespread support for limiting immigration, and some say the new decree does not go far enough. One   congressman is even calling for a wall to be built on the border with Bolivia. Claudio Suÿrez, 65, a worker at a bakery in Buenos Aires, called the immigration curbs ?fantastic. ? ?Nobody wants scum to come in from other countries,? he said. ?Many foreigners come here because health services and education are free. The law should be even stronger. ? Argentina?s history has been written by waves of immigration over the decades. After   wars of conquest killed off many indigenous people, the authorities encouraged millions of immigrants to come, largely from Europe, to help populate and develop the country. More recently, governments welcomed newcomers from Latin America, Asia and Africa, opening a path to citizenship for hundreds of thousands of immigrants and ensuring their access to public schools and health care. Officials in Mr. Macri?s government, which took over in 2015 by vowing to ease polarization and roll back the economic policies of his leftist predecessor, Cristina Fernÿndez de Kirchner, contend that they are still upholding Argentina?s openness to immigrants. ?Everyone should remain calm, because Argentina will continue to be a hospitable and open country,? said Horacio Garc­a, Argentina?s top immigration official. The new immigration decree says it is focused on fighting crime, arguing that 22 percent of inmates in the federal penitentiary system are foreigners. (When all of the country?s prisons are taken into account the figure is closer to 6 percent.) The decree specifically mentions ?organized crime? as a reason for the crackdown, but it expands the offenses that justify expulsion or blocked entry to include any crime that could lead to a prison sentence. Many worry that immigrants can now be expelled for minor crimes, like blocking a road during a protest. Immigrants hoping to fight a deportation order will have less than a week to file appeals. Previous measures granted 30 days to prepare a defense and the right to a government lawyer. ?Immigrants are hanging by a thread because anything could be cause for deportation,? said Gabriela Liguori, director of the Argentina Commission for Refugees and Migrants, an immigrant rights group. But the immigration official, Mr. Garc­a, said deportations ?will only focus on serious crimes. ? He contended that the measure was necessary because Argentina had become ?defenseless to criminals from other countries. ? Faced with criticism, officials in Mr. Macri?s government have had to make it clear that they are ruling out building a   wall on the Bolivian border. ?The problem isn?t immigration, but drug trafficking and contraband,? Security Minister Patricia Bullrich said after the Bolivian authorities questioned why she was publicly singling out Bolivian, Paraguayan and Peruvian immigrants for scrutiny. Despite Mr. Macri?s longstanding connection to the American president, Mr. Trump?s victory put the government here in an awkward spot. After all, Mr. Macri had made no secret that he was rooting for Hillary Clinton, saying that Mr. Trump was focused on building walls. But then Mr. Macri seemed to draw on his ties to Mr. Trump, becoming one of the first Latin American leaders to speak with him after the American presidential election. The call was quickly mired in controversy. A prominent Argentine journalist claimed that Mr. Trump had used the occasion to request Mr. Macri?s help in obtaining regulatory approval for a real estate project in Buenos Aires. Spokesmen for both leaders denied the assertion, though it emerged that Mr. Trump?s daughter Ivanka, who had no security clearance, had joined the phone call. Argentine authorities later confirmed that the Trump venture did not have the permits needed to begin construction. But in the end, plans for a Trump tower in Buenos Aires were called off as Mr. Trump came under pressure over potential conflicts of interest involving pending international deals. Critics say the new restrictions focus on poor immigrants to distract attention from the economy, which remains sluggish more than a year after Mr. Macri rose to power promising that   policies would usher in growth. Scrutinizing immigrants at times of stress is nothing new in Argentina, with the authorities long praising the country?s history of receiving European immigrants while portraying immigration from neighboring countries as less desirable, said Guillermo Cantor, a sociologist who specializes in immigration. In the late 1990s, President Carlos Menem?s government similarly cracked down on immigrants by associating them with street crime. In 2014, Mrs. Kirchner, the former president, threatened to expel foreigners who committed crimes in an overhaul of the penal code even after her government had legalized the irregular status of many immigrants. Other parts of Latin America are also grappling with bursts of   sentiment. With his nation suffering broad economic declines, Venezuela?s president, Nicolÿs Maduro, ordered a crackdown on Colombian immigrants in 2015, forcing many to flee across the border. An influx of Haitian immigrants to Chile is fueling a debate there over racism and discrimination. On the streets of Buenos Aires, immigrants had varying reactions to Mr. Macri?s decree. Jess Oriona, 45, a Bolivian who moved to Argentina as a teenager, said the government was simply ?throwing the blame at immigrants. ? But Maria Alejandra Alviarez, 39, a nurse from Venezuela who moved here a year ago and works in a health food store, said Argentina had been ?too free and open? before the decree. ?Macri?s not saying people can?t migrate, and qualified people like me will still be able to come here,? she said. Still others here contend that the shift is strategic, seeking   political points by blaming foreigners for ills in Argentine society ahead of legislative elections this year. ?Of course, we have our share of xenophobia, and now, in the glow of Donald Trump, they want to dilute the fact that a large share of us are children or grandchildren of immigrants,? said Ral Kollman, 68, a radio show host whose mother emigrated illegally to Argentina to flee the Nazis."
18278,Susanne Craig and Eric Lipton,4/02/2017,2017,2,politics,"Just days before his inauguration,   Donald J. Trump stood beside his tax lawyer at a Midtown Manhattan news conference as she announced that he planned to place his vast business holdings in a trust, a move she said would allay fears that he might exploit the Oval Office for personal gain. However, a number of questions were left unanswered  ?   including who would ultimately benefit from the trust  ?   raising concerns about just how meaningful the move was. Now, records have emerged that show just how closely tied Mr. Trump remains to the empire he built. While the president says he has walked away from the    operations of his business, two people close to him are the named trustees and have broad legal authority over his assets: his eldest son, Donald Jr. and Allen H. Weisselberg, the Trump Organization?s chief financial officer. Mr. Trump, who will receive reports on any profit, or loss, on his company as a whole, can revoke their authority at any time. What?s more, the purpose of the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust is to hold assets for the ?exclusive benefit? of the president. This trust remains under Mr. Trump?s Social Security number, at least as far as federal taxes are concerned. Since his election, there have been widespread calls for Mr. Trump to sell his assets and put the proceeds in a blind trust. He has resisted those calls, stressing that the president has no legal obligation to do so. While the trust structure, outlined in documents made public through a Freedom of Information Act request by ProPublica, may give the president the appearance of distance from his business, it drew sharp criticism from experts in government ethics. ?I don?t see how this in the slightest bit avoids a conflict of interest,? said Frederick J. Tansill, a trust and estates lawyer from Virginia who examined the documents at the request of The New York Times. ?First it is revocable at any time, and it is his son and his chief financial officer who are running it. ? It is not uncommon for people to place assets in a trust with themselves as beneficiaries for   purposes. But Mr. Trump?s situation is unprecedented because it involves a wealthy president acting to avoid an appearance of conflict of interest. The Trump Organization declined to comment for this article. The most immediate test of Mr. Trump?s legal moves to separate himself from his company, the Trump Organization, pertains to the ownership of the new Trump International Hotel in the Old Post Office Building in Washington. The trust documents, which were prepared last month, argue that ?all beneficial ownership in the licensee previously held by Donald J. Trump, personally, now is held derivatively and beneficially by The Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust,? which is legal language intended to suggest that Mr. Trump no longer has a personal tie to the hotel lease. A provision in the 2013 lease for the building, held by Mr. Trump and his three oldest children, appears to prohibit a federally elected official, including the president, from benefiting from it. But lawyers who specialize in federal contracts say the trust arrangement simply creates an additional legal step between Mr. Trump and the hotel  ?   meaning he will still profit from it. Robert H. Sitkoff, a professor at Harvard Law School, said the new details in the trust documents were unlikely to resolve the apparent legal problems with the Old Post Office site. ?Formally he is no longer the owner, but functionally he still is,? he said. Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, the ranking member on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform who has called for a congressional investigation into the lease, said he remained unsatisfied that Mr. Trump had addressed his conflicts. ?This is smoke and mirrors,? he said of the new documents. While Mr. Trump may have to take additional legal steps to avoid violating the terms of the Old Post Office lease, he is exempt from laws that prohibit federal employees from participating in government matters that will directly affect their own financial interests. At the Jan. 11 news conference in which she outlined the plans for Mr. Trump?s assets, Sheri A. Dillon, his tax lawyer, called the steps he had already taken significant, adding there was an agreement governing the president?s trust that ?sharply? limited the amount of information about his company that he could access. ?The   will have no role in deciding whether the Trump Organization engages in any new deal,? she said, ?and he will only know of a deal if he reads it in the paper or sees it on TV. ? Ms. Dillon added that an asset sale by Mr. Trump would also be fraught with issues. ?Whatever price was paid would be subject to criticism and scrutiny,? she said. ?Was it too high? Is there pay for play? Was it too much pay to curry favor with the  ?? The Trump Organization, which is privately held, has also released a list of 488 Trump companies that Mr. Trump has held positions at, saying he resigned from all of them. Public records show that he has severed ties from some of these entities. The Trump Organization has pledged not to pursue new business deals overseas, though it plans to expand within the United States. Last month the company named Bobby Burchfield, a longtime Republican Party lawyer and corporate litigator, as an ?independent ethics adviser. ? The Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust has existed since at least 2014, records show. By 2016 it was the only shareholder in DJT Holdings, one of Mr. Trump?s main limited liability companies, according to documents filed by Mr. Trump as part of his bid for president and released by the Federal Election Commission. That company holds some of Mr. Trump?s largest assets, including his Old Post Office lease, golf courses and residential properties including a house in Beverly Hills, Calif. New York City property records show that in recent weeks Mr. Trump has transferred several residential condominiums he owns into the trust."
18460,Gerry Mullany,14/03/2017,2017,3,accidents,"HONG KONG  ?   Hundreds of pilot whales that swam into a shallow New Zealand bay died overnight after they got stuck in the waterway and beached themselves on the coastline. More than 500 rescuers tried frantically to send the pilot whales back out to sea, but at least 250 died in what officials called one of the worst whale strandings in New Zealand?s history. Attempts to refloat the remaining whales during high tide met with partial success. About 50 whales had swum out of the bay after high tide, according to the Department of Conservation, but as many as 90 others had rebeached themselves by Friday afternoon. Volunteers said they would try to refloat the stranded whales again on Saturday. Whale strandings at Farewell Spit, at the northern tip of New Zealand?s South Island, happen most years, Kath Inwood, a ranger, told The Associated Press. But the high number of whales trapped this year has surprised conservation officials. The whale stranding was the largest in the country since 1985, when 450 were stranded near Auckland. New Zealand has one of the highest rates of whale strandings, which are believed to occur when the mammals, who are known for their social bonding, make navigational mistakes while chasing prey, escaping predators or trying to protect sick members of the group."
17327,Jennifer Schuessler,2/01/2017,2017,1,entertainment,"Writers are different from the rest of us. Their castoff scraps can be worth money, not to mention the obsessive attentions of future scholars. Jonathan Lethem, 52, recently became the latest author to sell his personal paper trail to a major archive. The Beinecke Rare Book  Manuscript Library at Yale University acquired a trove of his manuscripts, letters, notes and other artifacts, which will now sit alongside material from Walt Whitman, Sinclair Lewis, James Baldwin and Marilynne Robinson in its rich American literature collection. Mr. Lethem?s papers contain items relating to the novels that made him something of a reluctant patron saint of Brooklyn?s literary ascendance, including ?Motherless Brooklyn? (1999) and ?The Fortress of Solitude? (2003). But as befits a lifelong collector, music obsessive, comics geek and dedicated chronicler of underground culture, there are also   cartoons, New York 1970s ephemera and what is surely the largest cache of drawings of vomiting cats in any university collection. ?For an author who is so much fun as a novelist, it?s interesting to see there is so much fun in his archival documents as well,? said Melissa Barton, the curator of American prose and drama at the Beinecke. (Ms. Barton, citing library policy, declined to say what Yale paid in the sale, which was arranged by the Manhattan book dealer Glenn Horowitz.) Mr. Lethem?s archive also includes two computer hard drives, a laptop and other digital materials, especially from more recent years. ?You can feel the evaporation of the physical ephemera,? Mr. Lethem, whose most recent novel, ?A Gambler?s Anatomy,? appeared in October, said in an interview. But the bulk of the collection consists of   artifacts, some of them charmingly weird. We asked Mr. Lethem, who left New York in 2010 to teach creative writing at Pomona College in Claremont, Calif. about some of the odder items in his literary closet. The archive includes a number of   comic books Mr. Lethem made as a child, featuring invented superheroes like   Man, whose origin story included an   attempt to start a nudist colony in Alaska. In one installment,   Man (who later got a passing   in ?The Fortress of Solitude?) battled Ed Koch, who was no hero to Mr. Lethem?s   bohemian parents. ?I didn?t make multiple copies to sell or anything,? he said. ?It was more like I was collecting my own weird artifacts from a pretend universe where   Man was a real comic. ? Mr. Lethem swiped this sticker after stumbling on a shoot for the 1979 movie ?The Warriors? in the   subway station in Brooklyn, which was standing in for the Times Square station. ?This was my subway stop, and the fact that they were turning it into 42nd Street seemed absurd,? Mr. Lethem recalled. ?I remember thinking that no one would see or hear about this movie. Nothing that anyone was shooting in my neighborhood could possibly be important. ? The archive contains typescripts of his novels, often affixed with alternate titles. (Would ?Motherless Brooklyn? have been a hit if it had been called ?Jerks From Nowhere??) The earliest is ?Apes in the Plan,? an unpublished ?fake Philip K. Dick novel,? as Mr. Lethem put it, named for a Devo lyric and written between ages 18 and 23. ?I wrote three novels on an electric typewriter,? he said. ?If I live long enough, I could end up being one of the last living humans who can say that. ? This diary tracking his writing progress, social interactions, exercise and, um, digestion comes from the   when Mr. Lethem had dropped out of Bennington College and moved to Berkeley, Calif. to try to become a writer. ?I had thrust myself into a kind of vacuum,? he said. ?I had no visible means of support, nor was anyone expecting to hear from me. This kind of weird   probably had to do with externalizing my superego and answering the question ?Who are you and what did you actually do today? ?? About those drawings of vomiting cats   ?     ?For about 15 years, every time I had a really good dance party that went late, with people lolling around drunk and exhausted, at about 2 a. m. I would hand out paper and ask everyone to draw a vomiting cat,? Mr. Lethem said. ?I ended up with an incredibly thick file of drawings, some by people who went on to be published cartoonists and writers. ? Some of the goofy character names in Mr. Lethem?s novels are drawn from   lists he typed up early in his career, a habit he connects with the wordplay of ?Motherless Brooklyn,? whose narrator has Tourette?s syndrome. Mr. Lethem recalled a moment of recognition sparked by an Oliver Sacks essay about a surgeon with Tourette?s who kept a list of more than 200 unusual names as ?candy for the mind. ? ?He was collecting real names,? Mr. Lethem said. ?But when I read that, I thought, ?Oh my God, that?s me. ?? Names from this list showed up in ?Gun, With Occasional Music? (1994) and ?Chronic City? (2009). ?The Fortress of Solitude,? inspired by Mr. Lethem?s Brooklyn childhood, describes a   store called Samuel J. Underberg, ?a site of mysterious life,? where graffiti artists came to buy ink that was specially formulated for stamping prices on slimy packages of meat and therefore ideal for tagging. While writing, Mr. Lethem acquired some random items from the real Underberg?s (now demolished) which are shown here with a 1978 Billboard Hot 100 list, an old calendar and other research materials. ?I became a collector of all this tawdry used signage,? he said. ?I just thought it was really weird and cool. ? The archive contains dozens of letters from fellow writers and artists, including Donna Tartt, Paul Auster, Suzanne Vega, Jennifer Egan, Thomas Berger and Ursula K. Le Guin. This missive, written on an airline safety card, is from the novelist David Bowman, who died of a cerebral hemorrhage in 2012. ?All his letters were like mail art,? Mr. Lethem said. ?David had a great, crazy brain. He never stopped covering the world in language. ?"

In person: Official tickets for the prime viewing areas have already been distributed, but inaugural spectators can watch the   ceremony from along the National Mall or set up along the Pennsylvania Avenue parade route. Be prepared for significant security and traffic delays. Here is more information on how to attend in person. As Mr. Trump takes office on Friday, he is less popular than any new president in modern American history, according to a series of surveys published in recent days. The numbers suggest that rather than unifying a divided electorate, his transition to power has continued the polarization from the campaign. Polls released on Tuesday by CNN and ORC and by The Washington Post and ABC News found that just 40 percent of Americans approved of the job Mr. Trump has been doing during the transition. Mr. Trump?s aides say they have had that atmosphere in mind while planning the week?s festivities. More than 60 Democrats in the House of Representatives said they would not attend the ceremony  ?   many of them citing Mr. Trump?s recent criticism of Representative John Lewis, a civil rights icon. A   security bubble has encircled much of downtown Washington, as almost 30, 000 local, state and federal officials work to ensure that the transfer of power goes off without a hitch. The authorities began enforcing a soft and a hard perimeter in central Washington in the early hours of Friday morning, and other road closings around the region followed. Only local vehicles were allowed within the soft perimeter. No civilian vehicles could pass inside the hard perimeter, where federal security forces were screening anyone hoping to enter by foot. To assure security, many items, including backpacks and posters, are prohibited on the Capitol grounds, along the parade route and at the inaugural balls. The National Park Service decided on Thursday to allow small umbrellas onto the National Mall and parade route because of rain in the forecast. The official   ceremony began on Friday on the West Front of the Capitol overlooking the Mall. Most of the nation?s dignitaries were on hand, including Mr. Trump?s presidential opponent, Hillary Clinton, and her husband, former President Bill Clinton. Jackie Evancho, a    singer best known from ?America?s Got Talent,? performed the national anthem. And six religious leaders chosen by Mr. Trump offered blessings. As Chief Justice Roberts administered the oath of office, Mr. Trump rested his hand on two Bibles: his childhood Bible and the Lincoln Bible, which Mr. Obama also used. Mr. Trump recited the 35 words mandated by the Constitution: He then delivered his inaugural address. After they officially review the armed services Friday afternoon, Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence will lead a parade on Pennsylvania Avenue from the Capitol to the White House. A tradition since Thomas Jefferson?s inauguration in 1801, the parade is one of the inauguration?s highlights and typically draws large crowds and TV viewers around the country. More than 8, 000 people will march behind the president and vice president, according to the Presidential Inaugural Committee, including representatives of each branch of the American armed services, as well as high school, college and police bands that have volunteered to perform. This year?s parade is expected to be considerably shorter  ?   about 90 minutes  ?   than those celebrating Mr. Trump?s recent predecessors. It will also pass a certain conspicuous building that bears the name of the 45th president. Come nightfall, many of the inaugural revelers will dress in their best evening wear to attend balls across the capital  ?   including some to galvanize resistance to Mr. Trump. All in all, the night should be tamer than eight years ago, when the Obamas attended 10 official inaugural balls and supporters held scores of others. Mr. Trump will attend just three official balls himself. Two of those, ?Liberty? and ?Freedom,? will take place at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center and are available to supporters who donated to his inauguration or purchased tickets. The third, the ?Salute to Our Armed Services Ball,? will be at the National Building Museum for active duty and reserve military members, wounded veterans, emergency medical workers and Medal of Honor recipients. Mr. Trump will deliver remarks at all three balls and, as is customary, he will oblige the attendees with a ceremonial first dance with his wife, Melania. Protesters are not unusual at an inauguration, but Mr. Trump?s is expected to attract many more than usual. Law enforcement officials said they were expecting 99 groups to carry out demonstrations of all sorts over the inaugural period, including 63 on Friday. The largest event by far will be the Women?s March on Washington, which is on Saturday and is expected to attract several hundred thousand people. Beginning with a rally at 10 a. m. at Independence Avenue and Third Street SW, near the Capitol, the march is intended to raise awareness about a variety of social issues. Here?s what you need to know. Other protests will be scattered throughout the city. Two of the largest are Inaugurate the Resistance and #DisruptJ20.

17928,Jon Caramanica,30/01/2017,2017,1,entertainment,"Of all forms of homage, attention to detail is perhaps the most loving. It requires not just knowledge and dedication, but also thoughtfulness. It prizes accuracy both out of respect to the historical record, but also to those who wrote it. It celebrates the vision of the original creators more than the disruptive instincts of reinterpreters. By that measurement, ?The New Edition Story,? a vibrant, fiercely committed     that begins Tuesday on BET, is overflowing with love  ?   a jubilant celebration of a group that was preternaturally talented and rivetingly tortured. Few groups in modern black pop are as deserving of this treatment as New Edition, which transported the elegance of the male vocal groups of the 1970s into the first wave of RB?s dance with   in the late 1980s. The act released four essential albums, a couple more good ones, and spun off careers for all its members  ?   solo work by Bobby Brown, Johnny Gill and Ralph Tresvant, and a group, Bell Biv DeVoe, made up of the others. None of this happened without conflict. New Edition, which hailed largely from the Orchard Park projects in the Roxbury section of Boston, was a black act that was chided by its label for not being mainstream enough. The members squabbled with executives, management and among themselves. This was in many ways the archetype of the modern boy band  ?   so much so that when New Edition left Maurice Starr, who produced the group?s early songs, he created New Kids on the Block, essentially a white copy. For all of its musical influence, the group is probably best known for its internal dramas, its contractual nightmares and for the troubled adulthood of Mr. Brown. ?The New Edition Story? isn?t hagiography. Friction was integral to the group?s mystique, but the show spends a good deal of time on its earliest days as preteens trying to forge a style. (For this part of the series, the members are played by younger actors. Tyler Williams as Mr. Brown and Jahi Winston as Mr. Tresvant are particularly dynamic). New Edition?s ascent was rapid: ?Candy Girl,? the group?s 1983 debut single, went to No. 1 on the Billboard hot black singles chart, and the group had successful hits until the end of the decade. But in this   that stretch of time is depicted as one of turmoil and dissatisfaction. Mr. Tresvant (Algee Smith, tender and limber) carries the disproportionate burdens of the lead singer, earning acclaim and resentment. And of course, there?s Mr. Brown (a combustible Woody McClain) who?s perpetually at war: with the other group members, with management, with law enforcement and, of course, with himself. ?The New Edition Story? depicts a group of young men consistently slipping through the fingers of authority figures. That means their mothers (Sandi McCree as Carole Brown and Yvette Nicole Brown as Shirley Bivins are especially intense) their manager and choreographer Brooke Payne, played by Wood Harris, who conveys a   swagger with the tiniest cock of the head or extinguishing of a cigarette and their manager (in this case Gary Evans, a fictional   for the group?s manager in its late 1980s pop heyday) played by a manic Michael Rapaport. ?The New Edition Story? is, by far, the best of the recent spate of black pop biopics, miles beyond the shoestring Lifetime entries about Toni Braxton and Aaliyah, films that have contributed to an air of lowered expectations for projects of this nature. Instead, ?The New Edition Story?  ?   written by Abdul Williams and directed by Chris Robinson  ?   is more in keeping with the excellent ?Unsung?   about black musicians on TV One. It tells the group?s story, warts and all. (But not all the warts: Many of the details of Mr. Brown?s tumult have been left aside, and certain incidents, such as the      quarrels with the RB group Guy that led to the shooting death of that group?s head of security, didn?t make the cut.) It undoubtedly helps the   that the whole group  ?   the original members Mr. Brown, Michael Bivins, Mr. Tresvant, Ricky Bell and Ronnie DeVoe, as well as Mr. Gill, who joined after Mr. Brown?s departure  ?   signed on as  . While that might mean some light sugarcoating, it also results in a historical narrative told with impressive detai l, particularly in regards to wardrobe and production design (kudos to the costume designer Rita McGhee). Album covers, dance routines and video shoots are remade down to the tiniest details (the remade videos for ?If It Isn?t Love? and Mr. Brown?s ?Every Little Step? are impressive). The clothing is a virtuosic symphony of sequined suits, flowing synthetic fabrics, graffitied overalls. And then there?s the music: ?The New Edition Story? relies on effective rerecorded versions of the group?s many hits, sung by the actors (and mixed in places with original master recordings.) The music itself is handled by the duos of Babyface and Antonio Dixon, and Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, who?ve rebuilt the New Edition sound (much of which they originally created) with rigor and affection. Approval and faithfulness have limits, though. The group?s founding is streamlined, and some   slang slips into   scenes. Comparatively little time is spent on the group members? solo efforts, especially given that so much of the final installment focuses on the members? reconciliation in the   a reassurance that everyone ended up on the same page, putting their individual and collective troubles behind them. (The N. W. A biopic ?Straight Outta Compton? took a similar, though more maudlin approach.) Here, some liberties have been taken with the timeline, placing an impromptu reunion at Mr. DeVoe?s wedding, in 2006, before the group?s participation at a BET 25th anniversary show, in 2005, so that the   can effectively end with a   performance and a BET infomercial. This is slick positioning and salesmanship, but also disingenuous. New Edition has been as fascinating for its valleys as its peaks. For this group, the most fitting tribute is always the truth."
17675,Stephen Castle,16/01/2017,2017,1,entertainment,"READING, England  ?   With its     robotics, Magal Engineering?s factory in the colorless outskirts of this busy commercial town west of London is an important component of Britain?s booming car industry, churning out millions of sophisticated vehicle parts every year. Yet as Britain prepares to leave the European Union, Magal is having to rethink its operations here. The company has sister factories in France and Germany, imports components from them to assemble in Reading, and sends many finished products back across the English Channel  ?   all with minimal paperwork and no tariffs. Britain?s departure from the European Union could change all that, ending the   trade that Magal enjoys, potentially disrupting the hiring of crucial engineers from abroad and requiring new hires to keep up with the added paperwork. Britain?s exit is a ?big worry? and ideally would be stopped, says Gamil Magal, Magal Engineering?s chief executive. But as a realist, he is preparing to live with it. That means suspending investment in Britain and contemplating production cuts here, even as the company continues to put money into France. With Britain, the policy is ?wait and see,? Mr. Magal said, speaking in his office above this bustling factory in a building that once produced World War II aircraft. Although Britain?s economy has so far not suffered the economic blowback that many predicted would follow the vote in a referendum last year to quit the bloc, British companies that import or export goods and services are anxiously assessing the potential costs of departure. Complicating matters is continuing uncertainty over the terms of departure that the government wants to negotiate. Prime Minister Theresa May plans to start two years of formal talks with the European Union on Britain?s withdrawal, widely known as Brexit, by the end of March, and on Tuesday she is expected to give some more detail about her objectives. ?We don?t know what is going to happen, the government doesn?t know what is going to happen, and I am not sure that the government even knows what it is asking for,? said David Bailey, professor of industrial strategy at Aston University. There are signs that   companies might be taking action already, ahead of the actual Brexit. In a survey of 233 financial services companies published in The Sunday Times of London last week, 39 said they would reduce staffing because of the Brexit vote, and half of that number had already started to do so. For British banks, a big worry is whether they will able to continue offering services to clients across the bloc. ?Most international banks now have project teams working out which operations they need to move to ensure they can continue serving customers, the date by which this must happen, and how best to do it,? Anthony Browne, the chief executive of the British Bankers Association, wrote in The Observer last year. ?Their hands are quivering over the relocate button,? he added. Sectors like agriculture, hospitality and construction are worried about labor. They all rely heavily on workers from Southern or Eastern Europe, whose right to employment here may be curbed to achieve Mrs. May?s objective of reducing immigration. Mrs. May has not said explicitly whether she wants Britain to remain in Europe?s Customs Union, which provides for   trade across the   bloc, and includes some nonmembers like Turkey. Nor has she detailed what kind of relationship she wants with the European Union?s single market, which aims to eliminate nontariff barriers and to forge a single services market. But she said in a recent interview that when Britain quits the union, it will not be keeping ?bits? of its membership, suggesting that she will be seeking something closer to a clean break, or ?hard Brexit. ? And with the clock now ticking toward a planned departure from the union in 2019, companies are already having to contemplate that outcome, even before Ms. May lays out her intentions on Tuesday. For Mr. Magal, the threat of trade tariffs is forcing him to rethink the structure of his business. The company assembles thermostatic control units for car manufacturers, including Jaguar Land Rover in Britain and Daimler in Germany. Tariffs could add anything up to 10 percent to the price of some of his products, an increase he can neither afford to absorb nor pass on. ?We don?t make 10 percent profit  ?   that?s for sure,? he said, adding, ?We won?t be able to increase the price, because the customer will say, ?We will buy from the competition.? ? The logic is to reduce the amount of products that are made in Britain for continental Europe, and vice versa. Mr. Magal said that European clients were asking him to consider moving production. ?With all the new projects we are getting now from Europe, they are saying, ?Why can?t you put it in your plant in Europe? Why do you need to do it in the U. K.?? ? he said. If there is a hard Brexit, as seems increasingly likely, some production might be shifted to Britain from the Continent to serve the British market, but more would shift the other way, Mr. Magal said, adding that some parts could be made only in Germany. It is unclear what the impact will be on the Reading factory and its 230 jobs, or on another British factory that employs about 100 people. Mr. Magal is also worried about recruiting engineers, who are in short supply in Britain, if new immigration restrictions are put in place. And he thinks he may have to hire more administrative staff to deal with possible tariffs and other red tape. British car manufacturing, which has been booming in recent years after a period of decline, is particularly vulnerable to tariffs. Key components flow back and forth across the English Channel before a car is built, and then the assembled vehicle itself is often exported. That could mean paying tariffs repeatedly at different stages along the way. Around   of the 1. 6 million vehicles built in Britain in 2015 were sold abroad about 57 percent of British car exports go to the European Union. Last year, Gareth Jones, president of Britain?s Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, called for continued ?membership of the single market,? and the ability to trade ?free from barriers and red tape. ? He appealed to the government, ?Don?t screw it up!? British officials say, however, that the country imports more vehicles from the European Union (800, 000 a year from Germany alone) than it exports to it, so would be a net beneficiary, in revenue terms, from a tariff war. Yet Germany has a bigger economic interest in keeping the 27 other European Union nations together in a single market than it does in cutting Britain a favorable deal that would undermine that market. A   negotiation seems inevitable. And the longer Brexit uncertainty prevails, the less attractive Britain is likely to be for many manufacturers, including those from the auto industry. ?The value chain crosses borders numerous times, so anything that gets in the way  ?   tariff or nontariff barriers  ?   is likely to mean less investment,? Mr. Bailey said."
18236,Beverly Gage,2/02/2017,2017,2,lifestyle,"If we lived in normal political times, our new president would be enjoying his honeymoon period, those few blissful weeks of good will and high hopes that usually accompany the start of an administration. Instead, the election of Donald J. Trump to the nation?s highest office has provoked an opposition movement that is extraordinary in American history, with millions of people devoted to stopping whatever it is he might want to do. The declarations began early on, with one key word echoing across them. ?We are going to resist, we are going to oppose,? the filmmaker Michael Moore announced on the Friday after Trump?s election. ?This is going to be a massive resistance. ? The following week, the former MSNBC host Keith Olbermann began a new video series titled ?The Resistance. ? In December, a group of former Democratic congressional staff members published a   pamphlet titled ?Indivisible: A Practical Guide for Resisting the Trump Agenda,? calling on liberals and leftists to emulate the most effective tactics of the Tea Party. On Twitter, hashtags like #ResistTrump, #NewAmericanResistance and #TheResistance document the range of concerns and movements now assembling under one banner: climate change, net neutrality, Black Lives Matter, reproductive and immigrant and disability rights. The   Women?s March made all of this spectacularly visible, with a   show of defiance intended to put the president on notice. ?Today is not a concert,? the march organizer Tamika Mallory told the crowd gathered in Washington. ?It is not a parade. And it is not a party. Today is an act of resistance. ? Days later, activists unfurled a   banner from a crane behind the White House, with just one word printed on it: RESIST. As the term of choice for the emerging   coalition, ?resistance? signals urgency, the desire to stand up and say no before it?s too late. At the same time, it concedes some ground: With Republicans controlling all three branches of government, ?no? may be the only position available to Democrats, leftists and liberals. To resist is to do something negative  ?   to push back against someone else?s agenda when your own back is up against the wall. It is a desperate word for desperate times, filled with limits as well as possibilities. A call to resist is different from a call to ?organize? or  ?   to borrow a word from the   Age of Obama  ?   to ?dream. ? Those words conjure visions of better worlds. Resistance names what you don?t want and leaves the vision thing for another, less urgent situation. It suggests a notably dark story about the next four years, one in which Democrats and liberals spend most of their time in a defensive crouch. Resistance evokes the struggle against totalitarianism, conveying personal defiance and official powerlessness at the same time. So what does it mean to apply that word in an ostensibly democratic system? If you?ve lost at the ballot box but aren?t seeking   revolution, what are the most useful forms of political action? If ?yes? seems impossible but ?no? seems insufficient, what fills the space between? Before Trump?s election, anyone who claimed to have been a member of ?the resistance? was most likely over the age of 85, a veteran of   struggles in France and other   territories during World War II. That resistance involved armed conflict and personal risk of the bleakest sort, with guerrilla fighters hiding in the catacombs of Paris while Hitler?s forces did their worst above ground. Under fascist rule, there were no plausible options for political engagement. It was a fight to the death, and in early 1940s Europe, before the arrival of Allied troops, the outcome was far from certain. Talking about resistance still evokes this sense of honorable struggle against an occupying power. It implies patience as well as militancy, the ability to say no over and over and over again, to refuse to cooperate until the whole system crumbles. After the war, anticolonial movements from South Africa to Northern Ireland found their own strategies of resistance, settling in for long, sometimes bloody fights. The United States introduced its own peculiar twist on this idea, transforming a rallying cry of   liberation into a defense of white supremacy. In 1954, after the Brown v. Board of Education decision, white Southerners opted for ?massive resistance?  ?   a phrase coined by former Senator Harry F. Byrd of Virginia to describe the determined and bitter campaign to prevent the desegregation of Southern society. ?Massive resistance? defended the racial status quo, but it adopted the language of rebellion, casting the federal government itself as an illegitimate occupying power. The American left created a different language of resistance, much of it focused around the   activities of groups like the War Resisters League. This   sensibility reached its peak in the late 1960s, during the Vietnam War, when student activists proclaimed a transition, per one slogan, ?from Protest to Resistance. ? As the movement veterans Staughton Lynd and Michael Ferber pointed out in their 1971 book, ?The Resistance,? that shift grew out of a desire to embrace ?a deeper and riskier commitment, a move that warranted a new term to replace ?dissent? and ?protest. ??u2009? The goal was no longer simply to object to the war it was to throw a wrench into the war machine and make it stop. Antiwar activists continued to engage in peaceful protest  ?   but now some also burned draft cards and firebombed R. O. T. C. centers. A small number, like the Weathermen, took up bona fide guerrilla activity, planting bombs at the Capitol, the Pentagon and other prominent buildings. As the war and its    stakes came to an end, so, too, did the embrace of resistance as a literal armed underground conspiracy. But while it faded as a political strategy, it began to gain prominence as a category of academic social analysis, the sort of thing that anthropologists and historians looked for in their studies of human societies. This was part of a broader trend toward ?social history,? with its insistence that ordinary people  ?   not just generals and politicians  ?   could be the agents of serious historical change. Sometimes this meant studying organized revolts, like slave rebellions or peasant uprisings. By the 1980s, though, ?resistance? had come to encompass a much broader set of behaviors. Enslaved or oppressed people might resist by taking up arms, but they might also resist simply by refusing to do as they were told. The political theorist James Scott called these ?everyday forms of resistance?  ?   a category that could include giving a sullen look to an employer, deliberately misfiling forms or just living life, as much as possible, on terms of your own choosing. Today?s ?New American Resistance? seems to embrace at least some of this broader understanding. Joining it does not, thus far, require adherence to any particular ideology or set of tactical preferences. It simply means, in the biggest of   formulations, that you really don?t like Donald Trump, and you?re willing to do something about it. As a   enterprise, designed to achieve the greatest possible participation, this mode of resistance makes sense. But despite its good cheer, it still emphasizes what is not possible: It says that Trump is about to take a sledgehammer to the nation?s finest institutions and principles and that the only thing most citizens can do is shout ?no? as loudly as possible. Many organizers have vowed that this yawp of dissent represents a beginning rather than an end  ?   and history suggests that they may well be right. Some of the most significant shifts in modern American law and political culture came out of efforts birthed in panic and despair. During World War I, for instance, the United States banned criticism of the government, interned thousands of German Americans and instituted widespread surveillance of immigrants and political radicals. Many Americans supported these policies others feared that the country was abandoning cherished traditions of tolerance and free speech. In response, a small group of alarmed progressives founded an organization that came to be known as the American Civil Liberties Union. They lost many early courtroom battles, but their vision of a nation in which ?civil liberties? were taken seriously eventually changed the face of American law and politics. There are conservative versions of this story, too. In the   at a moment when the   liberal consensus seemed to be at its height, William F. Buckley Jr. announced plans to ?stand athwart history, yelling ?Stop! ??u2009? His new magazine, National Review, did not stop history, but it did provide a crucial platform for conservatives to think about where they wanted history to go. The budding movement set its sights on taking over the Republican Party and spent decades making that happen  ?   turning resistance into concrete political success. Today even Buckley?s form of conservatism seems to be under assault by the Trump administration. It is at just those moments when old categories start to collapse, however, that room often opens up for something new. A nascent resistance, right now, is delivering an unusually loud and impassioned ?no. ? But the mere act of refusal often turns out to have its own momentum. As people learn that they can indeed say ?no,? they may begin to find new ways toward saying ?yes. ?"
18300,Mark Landler,6/02/2017,2017,2,entertainment,"PALM BEACH, Fla.  ?   The news broke just as the fireworks began crackling over the grand estate?s manicured lawn, a festive backdrop for the guests sipping champagne around an ornamental pool: The White House had moved to appeal a court ruling that blocked President Trump?s sweeping immigration order. At airports around the world, the legal tug of war played out in starkly human terms, with travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries having to decide whether to board flights to the United States, unsure of whether they would be turned back once they landed. Yet here, in the cosseted confines of    those concerns seemed a million miles away. The guests had gathered for the 60th annual Red Cross ball, a staple of the Palm Beach social calendar, which this year carried the theme ?From Vienna to Versailles. ? In keeping with the Hapsburg and Bourbon motif, the male staff members wore powdered wigs and breeches the women were costumed in flouncy gowns and   beehive wigs in the style of Marie Antoinette, the queen guillotined in the French Revolution. The disconnect between high society and huddled masses would have been complete if not for the fact that   ?s proprietor  ?   the guest of honor that evening, though he had to stand in line with his wife to get into his own ballroom  ?   was the very person who had signed the immigration order and had gone to court to preserve it: Mr. Trump. ?We?ll win,? the president said to a reporter on   duty, who asked him whether he was confident of the government?s legal appeal. ?For the safety of the country, we?ll win. ? When another reporter asked whether he would abide by the federal court?s ruling, Mr. Trump smiled thinly but did not answer, shifting from foot to foot, as the first lady, Melania Trump, resplendent in a pink evening gown and diamond and emerald earrings, stared serenely ahead. This is    in the first month of the Trump presidency, still making the transition from a   club for the tanned and surgically enhanced snowbirds of Florida?s Gold Coast to the ?winter White House? that the cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post always dreamed it would be after she built the   castle in the 1920s. Like his residence, Mr. Trump is also still in transition, caught between the demands of being president (a 5 p. m. phone call with President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine) and the reassuring rituals of his old life (a round of golf at his club in nearby West Palm Beach). On his first weekend here since being inaugurated, the Red Cross ball fell into the   category. He had hosted the benefit several times over the past 20 years, said Dick Robinson, a friend and Palm Beach philanthropist, who stopped by to chat with the White House press corps, which now shows up alongside reporters from the local papers to chronicle events like this. The sight of Mr. Trump lining up with his guests was remarkable, given that presidents normally enter a room only after everyone else is seated, and then often to the strains of ?Hail to the Chief. ? With his tuxedo jacket unbuttoned, clutching his wife?s hand, he looked more like the   who spent years greeting the guests at his club. And yet there were myriad other signs of how Mr. Trump?s life has changed, from the security checkpoint set up in an adjacent parking lot and the police boat that bobs in the Intracoastal Waterway to the Secret Service agents who peered into the crowd as he and Mrs. Trump shimmied to a band playing Bob Seger?s ?Old Time Rock ?n? Roll. ? Mr. Trump?s weekend also had that    vibe that most presidential getaways have. In addition to the call with Mr. Poroshenko, he spoke to Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni of Italy, Prime Minister Bill English of New Zealand and the secretary general of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg  ?   a conversation that could not have been relaxing, given Mr. Trump?s earlier assertions that the alliance is a Cold War relic. In its   summary of the Ukraine call, the White House described the exchange with Mr. Poroshenko as ?very good? and quoted Mr. Trump as saying, ?We will work with Ukraine, Russia and other parties to help them restore peace along the border?  ?   a statement that did not take account of the fact that Russia unlawfully annexed Crimea. Mr. Trump brought along his chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and his chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, which suggested that he was briefed regularly on the legal battle over his immigration order. Mr. Priebus and Mr. Bannon both stayed at    which has guest rooms. Even when Mr. Trump was off the clock, he appeared preoccupied by the world outside. On Saturday morning, he began a Twitter tirade against the Seattle judge who had blocked the immigration order. Though he went quiet during the four and a half hours he was at the Trump International Golf Club  ?   the White House declined to confirm that he actually played golf or say who his partners were  ?   the Twitter posts resumed when he got back to the house. Even as his guests were mingling during cocktails, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, ?The judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interest at heart. Bad people are very happy!? When Mr. Trump bought    at a   price in 1985, he was viewed by many in this uppity enclave as a parvenu who would cheapen the legacy of the estate. Those days are gone  ?   especially now that he has the power to make his friends ambassadors to European capitals. But Mr. Trump still draws his share of catcalls  ?   some subtle, others not. Across the street from his golf club, the Palm Beach County Library had a sign in the front door advertising an evening with Amy Sherman, a reporter from The Miami Herald and PolitiFact Florida, to discuss how to expose disingenuous political figures. ?Pants on Fire: How to   Politicians,? it said. On Saturday, about 3, 000 demonstrators marched along Flagler Drive, carrying signs and chanting, ?    Donald Trump has got to go. ? About 300 managed to walk across the bridge to Palm Beach, according to The Palm Beach Post, where they got within 25 yards of    before encountering an armored security vehicle. At 8 p. m. when the fireworks exploded above the estate, they cast a glow on the crowd, witnesses said, giving them a better view of the show than the one enjoyed by the guests inside Mr. Trump?s winter White House."
18124,Ian Fisher,7/02/2017,2017,2,business,"MA?ALE ADUMIM, West Bank  ?   The first babies of Ma?ale Adumim, a hilly city on the eastern outskirts of Jerusalem, are now  . A cemetery finally opened last year, and 40 residents are buried there, most dead of natural causes after long and peaceful lives. That is to say, there is nothing temporary about this place, one of the closest settlements to Jerusalem in the occupied West Bank, which Israel seized from Jordan 50 years ago. ?It?s part of Jerusalem,? said Sima Weiss, 58, who has lived here 30 years, raised three children and works a cleaning job just 20 minutes away by bus in the holy city proper. ?I don?t feel like a settler. ? The world has focused more critically recently on Israel?s settlements in occupied territory, after last month?s United Nations declaration  ?   which the United States tacitly supported  ?   that they are killing the dream of one state for Jews, one for Palestinians. Many Israelis argue that Ma?ale Adumim  ?   a city of 41, 000 with filled schools, a largely secular civic pride and skittish stray cats  ?   is a special case: Its closeness to Jerusalem has put it near the top of the list of settlements Israelis say they could swap for other land in a peace deal. Yet Ma?ale Adumim has become a flash point of the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis.   politicians, emboldened by a more sympathetic Trump administration, want to annex it to Israel proper  ?   the first formal annexation of a settlement. Supporters of the move argue that in the long absence of negotiations, Israel cannot stand still, and Ma?ale Adumim would likely be a part of Israel in any case. ?Clearly it?s time for a quantum change,? Naftali Bennett, the education minister, who plans to introduce the annexation bill, said in an interview. ?The incremental approach has not worked. We have to understand it?s a new reality. We have to go big, bold and fast. ? The Parliament seems poised to approve a law that few thought had any chance of passage just a few months ago: It would ultimately legalize settlement homes built illegally on private Palestinian land. Critics call this yet another form of creeping annexation. Many Palestinians agree this is a critical moment. They fear Ma?ale Adumim will be just the beginning of the annexation of settlements in the West Bank, now home to roughly 400, 000 Jews, and the end of the   dream. ?We believe in two states for two nations, but if they took that?  ?   Ma?ale Adumim  ?   ?there will be no longer two states,? said Yousef Mostafa Mkhemer, chairman of the Organization of Jerusalem Steadfastness, which focuses on issues like Muslim holy sites, refugee camps and Israeli settlements. ?There will be one state called Israel. ? Many Palestinians and peace activists argue that the line has already been crossed  ?   that any annexation of Ma?ale Adumim, after so many years, would be a technicality. ?We are living in one state now,? said Ziad Abu Zayyad, a Palestinian lawyer and writer. Mr. Zayyad, a former Palestinian minister, said that unlike most Palestinians he supported Donald J. Trump for president, in part because he felt his apparently greater sympathy for Israel would begin to provide a clarity to a   conflict. ?I want to see a change,? he said. ?I?m fed up. ? ?He could be a big devil. He could be something good. My point is he will make a change, for the good or for the bad. ? There are signs, in fact, that the conflict here is already shifting, with Ma?ale Adumim near the center, no matter how quiet and workaday its residents think themselves (70 percent of residents commute to Jerusalem proper for their jobs). After eight years of little building, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu just allotted 100 new building units to Ma?ale Adumim, part of 2, 500 new proposed housing units around the West Bank settlements, and another 560 in East Jerusalem. Mr. Netanyanu has proclaimed this as just the beginning of a new wave of building. Less than a month after the United Nations resolution, the city?s mayor, Benny Kashriel, and another settlement leader proudly attended Mr. Trump?s inauguration. That would have been unthinkable for past incoming American presidents, out of fear it could be interpreted as an endorsement of settlements, which most of the world considers illegal. ?It?s a different policy,? Mr. Kashriel, mayor for 25 years, said just a day back from Washington. He believes that the new administration sees places like Ma?ale Adumim more benignly than did former President Barack Obama, whose administration blocked much building here and in the nearby E1, an especially contentious area closer to Jerusalem. ?We didn?t steal the land from anybody,? he said. ?It was built on empty hills. You can see there  ?   the desert, rocks and sand. Now you have a living city. ? Much of the outside world?s attention has focused on more religious settlements deeper into the West Bank or on land with Palestinian titles in more direct conflict with Palestinians. But here, scrutiny has been intense on Ma?ale Adumim. It is partly symbolic: Israel has not annexed 1967 land beyond East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights. Opponents of the move fear it would be the start of a process that would not end until politicians like Mr. Bennett achieved their dreams of annexing large swaths of the West Bank and leaving the Palestinians with what Mr. Netanyahu recently called ?a  . ? It is partly strategic: The settlement is at the heart of entrenched plans to expand Jerusalem, linking it to the city proper, along with other nearby settlements that also function in practice as Jerusalem suburbs. One issue with Ma?ale Adumim, critics argue, is its place in the West Bank, between north and south, that combined with other building plans could both hamper transit of Palestinians and threaten the contiguous borders of any future Palestinian state. The area is also not as empty as Ma?ale Adumim?s supporters say. Eid Abu Khamis, the leader of some 8, 000 Bedouins in the area, says harassment by Israel has increased recently. More of their makeshift housing has been torn down and land for their goats and sheep  ?   they sell meat, yogurt and cheese to survive  ?   declared  . Most of the Bedouins live in the E1 area, which is technically a part of Ma?ale Adumim and is slated for some 3, 700 new housing units. The Obama administration staunchly opposed any development in E1 as a possible point of no return for a viable Palestinian state. ?If the Bedouin are kicked out of this land where we have lived for 30 years, it will be the end of negotiations with the State of Israel,? Mr. Khamis said. Many Palestinians argue that the annexation could ignite another round of violent revolt. A Palestinian flag was recently planted in a park in Ma?ale Adumim here, a worrying sign for residents that the less expensive, less harried life in their suburb may change. ?I didn?t come because I believe we should take all the land between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River,? said a    resident, a driver who would give his name only as Max S. ?It was cheap. That?s why I came. If I could change my apartment to an apartment in Tel Aviv, in a minute I would do it. ? People here are proud of what they have built since it was founded in 1975, with 15 religious Jews. There is a library, a theater, 15 schools and 78 kindergartens. It is mostly secular, but gets along with its more religious residents, about a quarter of the population. An industrial park, while the occasional target of the worldwide campaign to boycott goods made in settlements, is thriving and employs some 4, 000 Palestinians  ?   at much higher wages, the mayor notes, than they could earn in Palestinian areas. Ronit Jackov, 55, who works in the local mall (which is getting a new floor with five cinemas) said she favored annexation, largely so the city can begin to grow again after years of a building freeze. She said she would never move back to Jerusalem, in part because the city has become too religious and rigid. ?I?m not comfortable in a place where people tell you how to live,? she said. ?People want to live their lives. ? And she places much hope in Mr. Trump, that he will side more forcefully with Israelis. ?I?m not a very political person,? she said. ?But I?m waiting for him to carry out what he said, and I?ll say, ?You are great.? Because the whole world is against us. We need someone on our side. ?"
18371,Brian X. Chen,14/02/2017,2017,2,business,"EVERYONE is familiar with this scenario: An app you once loved no longer brings the same joy. It?s gotten buggy over time, or an update transformed it to the point it became unusable. Chances are you thought about calling it quits. But after years of sharing your personal data with this app, you probably gave up and stayed in this stale relationship. You put up with the   bugs and odd design changes because moving to a new, potentially better app felt harder than sticking with the bad one. Take Evernote, the   app. After nearly a decade attracting millions of users, the company last year severely restricted free use of its software while raising prices for its plans by as much as 40 percent. This month, Evernote also released a redesign for its mobile app, which users complained was bloated with unnecessary features that have made note taking too complex. Even so, people have stuck with Evernote partly because taking their notes elsewhere is hardly easy. ?We understand those kind of changes don?t make everyone happy,? said Greg Chiemingo, an Evernote spokesman. ?In fact, we?ve seen continued growth of paying customers over the last two years. ? People deserve better than this. Every day you stay with a bad app is time you could be spending with a superior product that will make life better. Here are my tips, based on interviews and personal experience, for a clean break. No app is perfect, but you have to draw the line somewhere. The problem is, you may be in such a rut that you can?t recognize the warning signs. An obvious one is when an app stops working reliably in a way that affects your life. For instance, I called it quits on Apple?s Calendar app when I was planning a dinner with friends last month and the software sent a calendar invite in Greenwich Mean Time rather than Pacific Standard Time. As a result, one person thought we were meeting on Saturday instead of Friday and didn?t show up. (It wasn?t the first time this happened, either.) Brian Fitzpatrick, a former manager at Google who led a team that developed tools to help people move their data to and from Google, said he dumps an app when it has stopped improving. ?It?s still functioning, but you don?t see any changes in it for a very long time,? he said. ?It?s sort of a zombie app, I would call it at that point. ? Another sign that it?s time to move on is when you have nobody to talk to. Many popular apps for tasks like note taking, photo management and word processing are connected to social networks, or people you can share data with. If an app?s audience is a ghost town  ?   like Yahoo?s   app, Flickr, which sank in popularity after mobile   services like Instagram emerged  ?   then it?s probably time to leave. Yahoo did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Flickr. The hardest part of breaking up with an app is moving your data. So as a rule of thumb, save a backup copy of your data so that you can export it into a new app. Then carefully search for a better app to suit your needs. As a safety measure before changing apps, you should always keep extra copies of your data somewhere, whether it be in the cloud with a service like Dropbox or on a physical hard drive. Some companies deliberately make exporting your data difficult because they want you to stick around. ?It?s sort of like moving into an apartment and finding out at the end of the lease you can?t take your furniture and your books with you,? Mr. Fitzpatrick said. Evernote is a good example. It includes an ?Export notes? feature, but it only lets you export notes into two formats that are compatible with just a few other   apps. Microsoft?s   app OneNote, along with Apple?s Notes app, can easily import Evernote records. But if your app of choice is something else, such as Google Keep, you will have to manually paste your notes in the new app. Flickr is also difficult to part ways with. Getting out your photos requires lots of manual labor: You have to download all the photos, which can take a significant amount of time if you have thousands of   images, and then upload them to a new photo service. When companies don?t provide convenient tools to export your data, look elsewhere by doing a quick web search for solutions. There are plenty of people in the same boat as you, and chances are they have written scripts, or lightweight programs, to automatically pull out your data for you. If there is no convenient way to export your data, sometimes it doesn?t hurt to just take out what is most important to you. Perhaps you don?t need    notes from Evernote anymore, so you could just manually paste your latest memos and get a fresh start with a different app. On the bright side, you can learn a lot from a tough breakup with an app  ?   which can be especially useful when looking for a replacement. The biggest lessons: Pick a tool that supports a wide array of formats instead of proprietary ones. And before you commit to a new app, make sure it is as easy to get out as it is to get in. Ditching Apple?s Calendar app was fairly easy. All my calendar data was already stored online and Apple?s app supports calendars from multiple online services including Google, Microsoft and Facebook. The key was finding an app that also supported those services but performed better. After testing several apps, I decided that Fantastical 2, a new app with a cleaner interface for getting a glance at calendar events, was the best one. Once Fantastical 2 was installed, I added my Google calendar accounts to load all my events into the app. Mr. Fitzpatrick recently decided to cut ties with Google Voice, the search giant?s calling and texting service, because it had remained unchanged for years. So he made backups of his call history, text messages and address books using Google Takeout, a web tool that he helped develop for easily downloading personal data stored on Google services. Then he switched to Signal, the encrypted messaging service, which has more modern features for messaging and phone calls, and disconnected his Google Voice. Google said it updated Google Voice on Monday with photo sharing and group messaging. But that was too late to keep people like Mr. Fitzpatrick. ?A lot of it comes down to, How interested are you in change?? he said."
18259,Michael J. de la Merced and Rachel Abrams,3/02/2017,2017,2,business,"The Macy?s of today grew from the union of several great names in American retailing, including its namesake chain, Bloomingdale?s and Marshall Field?s. But the ambitious owner of Saks Fifth Avenue has broached the idea of taking the union even further, combining with Macy?s to create a department store juggernaut at a time when the industry is reeling. Hudson?s Bay Company, the Canadian owner of Saks, has approached Macy?s about a potential takeover, people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly said on Friday. Talks between the two companies are at an early stage and may still fall apart or lead to a partnership of some kind rather than a sale. While it is unclear whether a deal will happen, a combination could lift the fortunes of Macy?s, the country?s biggest department store, which has been struggling. Investors certainly appeared to see it that way. Shares of Macy?s rose as much as 12 percent on Friday, its biggest intraday gain since Aug. 11, according to data from Bloomberg. Once a retail titan, Macy?s has struggled to remain relevant as   and discount retailers have decimated the traditional    business. Last month, Macy?s announced plans to cut more than 10, 000 jobs and close some of its 880 stores. Terry Lundgren, its chief executive and the architect of Macy?s last big merger, is expected to step down by the end of March. He will be succeeded by the company?s president, Jeffrey Gennette. Since the recession, shoppers have grown accustomed to hunt for bargains and to not pay full price. Discount stores and outlet malls have flourished. Traditional stores have been compelled to respond by trimming prices, which cuts into their margins. Departments stores have been hit especially hard, particularly as shoppers migrate away from malls. What has emerged, analysts say, is a virtual race to the bottom. That has been particularly difficult for Macy?s, born of a series of mergers over the past two decades that made it a juggernaut in the industry. A stalwart of the middle tier of retail, the company has neither the advantages of   retailers like HM nor the   stores. In addition, Macy?s faces increasingly fierce competition online from sites like Amazon and elsewhere. Macy?s troubles have drawn the attention of a prominent activist hedge fund, Starboard Value, which has urged the company to generate cash by selling the real estate beneath its stores. Starboard, which held just under 1 percent of Macy?s shares as of Sept. 30, had previously estimated the value of that land at about $21 billion. On Friday, analysts at Citigroup estimated that Macy?s   holdings could be worth at least $18 billion. Macy?s market value, by comparison, was just under $11 billion as of Friday morning. Macy?s has taken some steps to sell or redevelop stores, and last year, it added an expert on real estate transactions to its board. But the company has largely resisted more ambitious efforts to divest its real estate, including     deals, in which a company sells the underlying land beneath its stores and then rents it back. The company?s suitor, Hudson?s Bay Company, is far smaller  ?   its market value was about 1. 9 billion Canadian dollars, or $1. 5 billion  ?   but is known for its bold steps. Hudson?s Bay Company has assembled a growing empire that includes the Hudson?s Bay department store chain, Lord  Taylor and its crown jewel, Saks. And the governor and executive chairman of the Hudson?s Bay Company, Richard Baker, has shown little fear of using debt: In November 2014, the company borrowed nearly $4 billion against the Saks flagship in Midtown Manhattan. He has spoken often of retailers? need to highlight the value of their real estate. Financing a bid for Macy?s may be trickier, however, because the it carries about $6. 5 billion in   debt. That may mean that the Hudson?s Bay Company will have to bring in a partner or borrow against more of its real estate holdings. A spokesman for the Hudson?s Bay Company declined to comment on the talks, which were reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal. ?We do not comment on rumors and speculation,? a representative for Macy?s said. A representative for Starboard Value did not respond to a request for comment. Some analysts said that they saw the merit of a potential combination, particularly given Macy?s operational woes and Mr. Baker?s expertise in wringing money out of real estate. ?There is a clear logic, despite disparity in   cap? between Macy?s and Hudson?s Bay Company, Craig Johnson, the president of Customer Growth Partners, a research firm, said in a note. Referring to Macy?s stock ticker symbol, he added, ?The retail market has been changing faster than M has been able to keep up with, whether the flight from the mall or the migration online. ?"
17708,Kirk Semple,17/01/2017,2017,1,crime,"MEXICO CITY  ?   Five people were killed early Monday at a crowded nightclub in the popular Caribbean tourist destination of Playa del Carmen, Mexico, when an armed man who had been denied entry opened fire inside the club, prompting a gun battle and a stampede, officials said. Four of the victims, including three members of the security team that had blocked the gunman?s entry, were hit by bullets, and the fifth victim was trampled in the resulting pandemonium, the authorities said. The shooting occurred at the Blue Parrot nightclub, which was hosting the final night of the BPM Festival, an international electronic music event that draws fans from around the world. The gunman entered the club around 2:30 a. m. but was turned away at the door because he was carrying a weapon, said Miguel ?ngel Pech, the state attorney for Quintana Roo State, on the Yucatÿn Peninsula. The man then opened fire, and as patrons threw themselves to the ground or rushed for the exits, security guards at the club ?repelled? the attacker, Mr. Pech said, adding that the guards were apparently armed. The victims included two Canadians, a Colombian, an Italian and a Mexican, and at least 15 other people were injured, including at least three Americans, the authorities said. The gunman has not been captured or identified, but several people were detained soon after the shooting and were being held for questioning, officials said. Mr. Pech, speaking at a news conference on Monday morning, did not suggest why the gunman had tried to enter the club with a weapon, but he said the attack was not an act of terrorism. In an interview with Foro TV later in the day, the state attorney said that investigators had not discounted the possibility that the attack had something to do with a fight between criminal groups or with an extortion racket. Investigators at the scene have recovered 20 casings from three firearms, officials said, though it remained unclear whether some of the bullets had been fired by weapons belonging to the security personnel or, perhaps, to one or more patrons. Humera Hamad, a resident of El Paso, Tex. who was on vacation in Playa del Carmen, said she was in the club when the shooting started. ?I couldn?t see anything,? she said in an interview. ?I just heard a blast and ran out of there, then started jumping fences. ? She added, ?I never looked back. ? Fabian Gonzÿlez Camacho, 33, was standing outside the club, near the entrance, and ran for safety after the attack began. ?I kept thinking: ?This is going to be a massacre. They are going to kill us all,?? he said. Survivors sought sanctuary in other nightclubs and stores, he said. ?A wave of panic, uncertainty and survival kicked in,? he said. ?We were all vulnerable people, having fun, getting drunk, many also doing drugs, and then this happened. ? Videos taken after the shooting and posted online showed clubgoers rushing through the streets of the resort town and crouching beneath tables outside nearby clubs and bars, stricken faces bathed in the glow of neon lights. ?We are overcome with grief over this senseless act of violence,? the BPM Festival management said in a statement posted on the company?s Facebook page. The festival is an annual   event that draws D. J. s, industry professionals and revelers from around the world to Playa del Carmen, on the Caribbean coast of the Yucatÿn. The shooting could put a dent in the robust tourism industry of the Yucatÿn, which has generally been less violent than many other places in Mexico, attracting millions of visitors to its white sand beaches and Mayan ruins."
17482,Choe Sang-Hun,10/01/2017,2017,1,business,"SEOUL, South Korea  ?   Less than a week after Donald J. Trump taunted North Korea over its ballistic missile capabilities, North Korea has said that it could conduct its first test of an intercontinental missile ?anytime and anywhere? in a rebuke to the incoming president. Although North Korea has vowed to develop the ability to attack the United States with nuclear warheads and has tested missiles that can reach throughout the Korean Peninsula and its vicinity, it has never tested a   missile that could fly over the Pacific. In a New Year?s Day speech, Kim   North Korea?s leader, said his country had reached a ?final stage? in preparing to test an intercontinental ballistic missile. That drew a Twitter post the next day from Mr. Trump that said, ?It won?t happen!? On Sunday, an unidentified spokesman of the North Korean Foreign Ministry told the North?s official Korean Central News Agency, ?The ICBM will be launched anytime and anywhere determined by our supreme leadership. ? The spokesman?s remarks, made public on the KCNA website Monday, were in response to comments last Thursday by Antony J. Blinken, the United States deputy secretary of state, that North Korea had made ?a qualitative improvement? in its missile capabilities over the past year. And he said Washington and its allies would continue ?comprehensive, sustained pressure and sanctions? against the North. On NBC?s ?Meet the Press? on Sunday, Ashton B. Carter, the departing secretary of defense, said the United States would shoot down a North Korean missile ?if it were coming towards our territory or the territory of our friends and allies. ? It remains unclear how close North Korea has come to building a reliable ICBM. Although it has displayed the     believed to be its first ICBM, during military parades in recent years, it has never   that system. In the past year, however, North Korea has boasted of successfully testing key technologies, such as   missile engines and heat shields for an ICBM. Last Tuesday, John Kirby, a spokesman for the State Department, said Washington did not believe that North Korea had achieved its goal of tipping   missiles with nuclear warheads, though it continued to ?march in that direction. ? North Korea has sought to develop by early 2018 miniaturized nuclear weapons that can fit atop a missile capable of reaching the United States, Thae   a former North Korean diplomat who defected, told the Yonhap news agency of South Korea on Sunday."
17891,Taras Grescoe,29/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"China?s Communist Party celebrated its 95th birthday this summer with a lavish First of July gala at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. In Shanghai, where the First National Congress took place in 1921, the occasion was noted in a more subdued way, with the promotion of a digital map of the important sites of the party?s heroic early years in   Shanghai. The map is a simple affair. Clicking on a man wearing scholar?s robes, for example, sends a cartoon icon toddling off to the brick building on Lane 163 of Zizhong Road, where Chen Wangdao, one of the party?s founding members, translated ?The Communist Manifesto? into Chinese. (A   and   app version will soon be available for smartphones.) A problem for anyone contemplating a   pilgrimage to the urban shrines of the Communist Party: Much of the historic city depicted on the virtual map has been wiped off the real map of Shanghai by two decades of breakneck development. The few remaining buildings, among them Dr. Sun  ?s modest   mansion in the former French Concession, stand in the shadows of   or   towers. On a recent visit, my quest to find Mao Zedong?s first address in Shanghai, on a street once known as the Alley of Benevolence and Kindness, ended in the Jing An Kerry Center, a 3.    residential and office complex. The   rowhouse, where the future Great Helmsman once folded laundry and ate rice in an attic room, now sits between a   luxury mall and the     Hotel?s steakhouse. Fortunately, enough examples of Shanghai?s historic architecture have survived to give visitors a sense of what life was like when the city gave birth to the Communist Party. To walk through Shanghai?s last remaining shikumen (alleyway complexes entered through a   kumen, or gateway) is to return to the wicked, glamorous ?Paris of the Orient?  ?   and to get a glimpse of what has happened to Shanghai in the century since then. My first introduction to shikumen came 10 years ago, when Peter Hibbard, the former president of the Shanghai chapter of the Royal Asiatic Society China, took me on a tour of an alleyway complex near the riverfront Bund. ?Up until the ?90s, 80 percent of the population lived in two or   shikumen,? Mr. Hibbard told me then, as we wandered through an atmospheric maze of mostly vacant homes. ?They were basically city blocks that functioned as gated communities, with guards manning the front entrance. The whole essence of old Shanghai was that life was lived horizontally  ?   all the activity happened at street level. ? Though the complex Mr. Hibbard showed me has since been razed, you can get an idea of what shikumen were like by visiting Xintiandi, a reconditioned alleyway complex located in the Huangpu and Xuhui districts, which were until 1943 the city?s French Concession. The houses at 76 and 78 Xingye Road were saved from the wrecker?s ball only because they played host to the clandestine First National Congress of the Communist Party. Turned into a memorial 30 years later, by which time the private residences had become a noodle factory, they are now a museum and the cornerstone of Xintiandi (the name means ?New Heaven and Earth?) a   shopping and entertainment district. On the second floor of a thoroughly modern exhibition space, the Congress is commemorated in the orthodox Communist way  ?   with starkly lit wax figures displayed behind glass. The skinny rowhouses that brought together two European members of the Comintern, 12 future party bigwigs and a    Mao have been preserved intact. Visitors walk through a lacquered partition into a   room with whitewashed walls. On a polished red floor, a dozen stools surround a long table, set with teacups and an open box of wooden matches  ?   a staging meant to suggest the participants have just left. (The meeting was, in fact, cut short by the sudden appearance of a police informer. Mao and his colleagues fled before the police could raid, reconvening on rented sightseeing boats in the tourist town of Hangzhou.) Wandering the lanes of Xintiandi gives a hint of the magic of the typical shikumen. Faced with   bricks and adorned with elaborately carved,   lintels, the rowhouses call to mind a radically compacted version of the terraced workers? housing found in northern English cities. The tributary lanes, some only eight feet wide, were built to accommodate rickshaws and bicycles, rather than cars, making shikumen tranquil oases in the heart of a   city. Commissioned mostly by Western developers, the first shikumen appeared in the 1870s, designed to offer wealthy families refuge from the flooding, famine and unrest of the countryside. The local contractors who built them drew upon the interior floor plans of traditional Chinese courtyard homes and local decorative motifs. The Shikumen Open House Museum, a refurnished private residence in the north block of Xintiandi, demonstrates the beguiling collision of East and West that resulted. Leaving an exiguous forecourt  ?   the equivalent of a front yard, generally used to wash and dry clothes  ?   you take a big step over a wooden sill into a rectangular living room decorated with blackwood furniture and period photographs and paintings. As you walk over creaking floorboards, soft jazz emanates from the horn of a gramophone. A woman?s sleeveless silk qipao hangs from a hook a jade hair clip, a tube of lipstick and a jar of powder are neatly arranged on a dressing table. In the kitchen, bamboo baskets,   colanders and a huge iron kettle are arranged around a potbellied coal stove. Halfway up a precipitous, dogleg staircase is the tingzijian, an unheated room often rented to bachelors. (Among them were the modernist writers Lu Xun and Yu Dafu, who eavesdropped on shikumen life from their    pavilion rooms). The upper floor is occupied by bedrooms, some with impressive   beds. The overall impression is of a luxurious, and surprisingly spacious, upper   home. It?s all beautifully staged, and terribly misleading. By the late 1930s, when the Second   War caused a wave of immigration to Shanghai?s   zones, most shikumen homes became occupied by four families and sheltered an average of 20 people. As an idealized vision of rowhouse life, the Open House Museum is like Xintiandi itself. Until the 1990s, the area was home to 2, 000 families. Their homes were gutted, and often completely rebuilt, to make way for a shopping district where you can buy a latte at Starbucks, a mug of pilsner at the Paulaner Br?uhaus or an   expensive silk scarf at the upscale clothing chain Shanghai Tang. ?Xintiandi is fake vintage,? said Ruan Yisan, the director of the National Research Center of Historic Cities at Tongji University and an architectural preservationist. ?There aren?t many shikumen houses left in the city. Those that remain are the living fossil of life in Shanghai. ? Professor Ruan remembers his teenage years in a Shanghai shikumen fondly. The day typically began with the ?Cantata of the Alley,? the sound of night stools (  latrines) as they were cleaned with bamboo sticks after being emptied by night soil men. Then the first vendors would arrive, selling   won tons, fried bean curd and fresh green olives, often delivered in baskets lowered from   windows. The alleys echoed with the cries of children running off to school, often within the same complex. During unexpected cloudbursts, the   grandma would rush to bring in clothes that absent neighbors had hung out to dry. In the summer, residents would gather after dinner to cheng fengliang (?enjoy the coolness?) trading gossip, playing   and sharing slices of melon chilled in a water well. ?Nowadays, our apartments in condominium towers have no public spaces,? he said. ?We don?t even know our neighbors. ? The shikumen, Professor Ruan believes, forged the character of the Shanghainese. Contact with foreigners and people from all parts of China made them cosmopolitan, and living cheek by jowl with neighbors made them into subtle   planners, capable of sidestepping    disputes while quietly plotting to further their own interests. He tells me that when shikumen construction ended in 1949, Shanghai counted 9, 000 alleyway complexes, housing up to four million people. The entire spectrum of Shanghai?s life took place in them: Shikumen housed nurseries and coffin makers, universities and Buddhist temples, hotels and   zones (the infamous Alley of Joint Pleasure was home to 171 brothels). Demolitions began in the 1990s, and intensified in the   to Expo 2010. Most expropriated residents were offered  ?   and accepted  ?   relocation, usually to new residential towers up to an hour?s metro ride from their old homes. (Holdouts found themselves harassed, and in a few notorious cases even killed, by construction crews.) Professor Ruan believes that only 200, 000 Shanghai residents continue to live in alleyway complexes. ?If you want to see what a typical shikumen is like,? he said, ?you?d better hurry. ? I rode the metro to the Xinzha Road station and walked a few blocks to eastern Siwen Li (Gentle Lane). Built over a former cemetery by a Sephardic Jewish entrepreneur in 1914, it was once home to 11, 000 people now it?s down to 12 households. After I stepped through its threshold, the smell of exhaust was replaced by air redolent with frying garlic and stewing meat. Brownish   exteriors were plastered with peeling posters for ?anticorpulence tablets? or scrawled with cellphone numbers of plumbers or fake ID peddlers. Many of the doors were daubed in red paint with the Chinese character ?K?ng? (?Vacant?). Between concrete sinks used for washing clothes, bicycles leaned against walls. Somewhere a rooster crowed. At the intersection of two alleys, a   residents had gathered on stools to pass the time. When I told one of them, Ni Wei Ming, 57, a taxi driver, that I had never seen the inside of a real shikumen home, he invited me into his. Though its    ?   forecourt for washing clothes, rectangular living room, steep rear staircase leading to   bedrooms  ?   mirrors the shikumen home in the Xintiandi museum, it lacked its idealized glamour. Room partitions were made of plastic sheets joined by duct tape cooking amenities were limited to a wok on a   hot plate the bathtub was a   wooden barrel. Though the government had offered to buy it for 7 million yuan (just over $1 million) Mr. Ni told me he was holding out for more. ?That would be enough money to be comfortable,? he said. ?But I?ll still have regrets. My primary school was here. I met my wife here  ?   she lived on the same block. My children did their homework with the neighbors? kids. There used to be a real feeling of community. Now there are only seven families left on my alley. ? Mr. Ni told me there was a rumor that a Hong Kong property developer planned to replace the complex with skyscrapers. Seeing me back to the laneway  ?   beneath the asphalt lie the original cobblestones  ?   Mr. Ni lit a cigarette and let his gaze run down the row of carved lintels that marked the entrance to each home. ?You know, if they chose to save and restore this place, it would be better than Xintiandi,? he said. (Since my visit, the municipal government has earmarked 260 historic neighborhoods for conservation. The Shanghai office of Chipperfield Architects will oversee the preservation of eastern Siwen Li?s buildings  ?   minus, unfortunately, the neighbors who made it into a neighborhood. The life stories of the shikumen?s residents have been collected in a beautifully illustrated book by the French architect J?r?my Cheval.) Other shikumen are scattered among Shanghai?s office and residential towers. Fude Li, where the Communist Party?s Second National Congress took place, is intact (Mao, who got lost in Shanghai?s back streets, failed to attend). The extraordinary Zhang?s Garden off West Nanjing Road, built by a Chinese merchant in 1882, has been saved from demolition because of its role as a community center for seniors. Less picturesque complexes, though, tend to be occupied by migrant workers, many of whom lack of residency permits, which makes the future of these homes tenuous. Perhaps the quickest way to get an idea of the vitality of a traditional alleyway complex is to visit Tianzifang, a   walk from the Dapuqiao station. In the late ?90s, the small factories and shikumen homes along Lane 210 on Taikang Road were occupied by painters, sculptors and ceramists. Their tiny workshops eventually became a complex of 200   cultural and art sites, with older residents continuing to occupy   apartments. Though local residents lament that cafes, restaurants and small businesses have begun to replace artists? studios, the district retains its original architecture and charm. The narrow cobbled lanes, shaded by trees and potted plants, are filled with window shoppers and diners who have stopped at a terrace to enjoy exquisite   Japanese coffee (Caf? Dan) or a chocolate milkshake or a smoked salmon bagel (Kommune). Unlike Xintiandi?s international chains, Tianzifang is home to such quirky local businesses as Pureland, which specializes in   ceramic tile images of koi ponds, pagodas and other traditional Chinese landscapes, and Teddy Bear Family, a Thai restaurant where every surface is covered with plush toys. Wandering around   Tianzifang is an antidote to the soaring Shanghai of magnetic levitation trains and  . Like other shikumen, it?s free of cars, making it one of the rare places in Shanghai where you can stroll without having to watch out for a darting electric bike or a barreling Volkswagen taxi. It?s a gentle reminder, too, of an irony of Shanghai?s recent history. In tearing down shikumen, which fostered the canny interdependence of the Shanghainese, government officials are erasing the architectural form that saw the birth of the uniquely Chinese version of Communism. The condominium towers that are replacing them, where   neighbors remain strangers, are breeding nothing but isolation."
18111,Steven Erlanger,31/01/2017,2017,1,business,"LONDON  ?   It had all been going so well. Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain had just left Washington on Friday evening after a tense but successful first visit with President Trump for a   flight to Ankara, Turkey, for her next awkward encounter, with the increasingly autocratic Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. By the time she had landed in Turkey, however, Mr. Trump had signed his executive order halting entrance to the United States of all Syrian refugees and of most citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Mrs. May was beginning to feel the backlash. After she termed the executive order an American issue, criticism erupted even among her own members of Parliament. She was accused of appeasement by a former British diplomat. Protesters gathered outside Downing Street on Monday night, and more than 1. 5 million signatures collected on an internet petition demanding that Mrs. May rescind her invitation for Mr. Trump to visit Queen Elizabeth II. A close relationship with any American president is regarded as crucial by allies and foes alike, but especially by intimates like Britain, Canada, Japan and Mexico. Yet like moths to the flame, the leaders of those nations are finding that they draw close at their peril. While Mrs. May is the latest prominent figure to suffer repercussions for her handling of Mr. Trump, the leaders of those other three close allies have also felt the sting of public anger soon after what seemed to be friendly telephone calls or encounters. They then find themselves facing a   situation, either openly criticizing the leader of their superpower ally or pulling their punches and risking severe criticism at home. One Western leader to escape this fate so far is the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who has kept a cool distance from Mr. Trump. In a telephone call on Saturday, she reminded him of Washington?s obligations under the Geneva Conventions to accept refugees fleeing war, a view underlined by her official spokesman. The danger of playing nice with Mr. Trump should come as little surprise to his country?s allies. Besides campaigning on an ?America First? platform, he has regularly argued that allies have been taking the United States for a ride, in trade, security and financial terms. While he has been cordial in public settings with the leaders of those allied nations, Mr. Trump has turned on them soon afterward. ?The problem for May is that Trump doesn?t value relationships. He values strength and winning,? said Jeremy Shapiro, the director of research at the European Council on Foreign Relations and a former senior State Department official. ?If you rush to the White House to offer a weak hand of friendship, you guarantee exploitation. ? While Mr. Trump?s executive order was clearly not aimed at Britain, he signed it on Friday, just a few hours after Mrs. May left. ?You can show up at his doorstep and hold his hand so he doesn?t fall down a ramp, but that doesn?t mean a few hours later when he?s signing an order he thinks at all about how it affects you, your politics or your citizens,? Mr. Shapiro said. Particularly problematic for Mrs. May was her offering the invitation to Mr. Trump to undertake a state visit with Queen Elizabeth II this year, which was accepted. The internet petition to Parliament calling for the cancellation of the invitation says the visit ?would cause embarrassment to Her Majesty the Queen. ? By Monday evening in Britain, there had been more than 1. 5 million signatures, and some were enjoying themselves watching the numbers rise in real time. At a large protest outside Downing Street, people urged Mrs. May to cancel the state visit and said that while relations with Washington were important, they should be cooler toward Mr. Trump. Amber Curtis, 21, a film student who is   and   said that she worried for her family and friends in America. ?It sends a bad message if he comes here after this ban,? Ms. Curtis said of Mr. Trump. ?I wouldn?t say that I want no relationship at all, but he cannot come here under the terms of this ban. The terms need to be renegotiated. ? Negma Yamin, 50, a teacher of Pakistani origin, was in tears. ?I?m so upset as a fellow Muslim I hate the persecution,? she said. Mrs. May ?should absolutely have no relationship with him,? she added. ?You can?t negotiate with a person like that. What is he going to do with the people? He?s dividing the U. S. he?s dividing the world. ? On Monday, Downing Street insisted that the invitation stood. But who knows how Mr. Trump will react? The Mexican president, Enrique Pe?a Nieto, has had a similar experience to Mrs. May?s  ?   twice. Last year, in the name of conciliation and dialogue, he invited Mr. Trump to Mexico, a somewhat questionable move given Mr. Trump?s contempt for Mexico and his promises to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, raise tariffs, deport millions of Mexicans, and build (or finish) a border wall and make the southern neighbor of the United States pay for it. The visit was widely viewed in Mexico as a national humiliation. It left Mr. Trump looking stronger and Mr. Pe?a Nieto looking weaker, especially when Mr. Trump, in an immigration policy speech in Phoenix the same day, insisted again that Mexico would pay for the wall. Mr. Pe?a Nieto persisted after Mr. Trump?s election, apparently aiming, like Mrs. May, to influence the new president and to moderate what many hoped was just hyperbolic campaign talk. But just before the two men were to meet in Washington, Mr. Trump issued executive orders calling for the wall and greatly restricting immigration. Mr. Pe?a Nieto called off the meeting only when Mr. Trump threatened on Twitter to cancel it unless Mexico agreed to pay for the wall. Embarrassed and cornered, Mr. Pe?a Nieto moved first, an act of defiance that provided a rare moment of public approval for the unpopular president. But given the importance of bilateral ties, he did speak to Mr. Trump the next morning for an hour, without setting a new date to meet. ?This is neither a victory nor a defeat,? said Fernando Dworak, an analyst in Mexico City. ?It is the bell ringing in a boxing match. ? Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan has the distinction of being among the first to feel the sting of Mr. Trump?s actions. In a meeting in November in New York, Mr. Abe urged Mr. Trump, then the   not to abandon a major trade deal, the   Partnership. One of Mr. Trump?s first actions in office was to abandon the deal, which many considered a victory for China, even though the pact had already been blocked in the Senate. Mr. Trump has long questioned the United States? financial and military commitment to Japan?s security, and he has criticized the automaker Toyota for planning to produce cars in Mexico. An editorial in the Mainichi Shimbun, a   paper in Japan, questioned why Mr. Abe was not taking a stronger stand against Mr. Trump: ?It is hard to understand why the prime minister is defending a president who destroyed the trade accord  ?   formed after nearly six years of arduous negotiations  ?   on his fourth day in office. ? Given the stakes, Mr. Abe has refrained from open criticism of Mr. Trump and is scheduled to meet with him in Washington early in February. The Trump effect has been felt even in Australia, where Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has come under criticism for saying it is not his job to comment on the domestic policies of other countries. This after securing a pledge from the president on Sunday to honor an Obama administration agreement to accept refugees detained on the Pacific islands of Nauru and Manus. In Canada, too, the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has had his Trump moments. Mr. Trump is deeply unpopular in the country, but as Mr. Trudeau?s father, former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, once said, proximity to America ?is in some ways like sleeping with an elephant no matter how friendly or temperate the beast, one is affected by every twitch and grunt. ? So instead of provoking a fight, Mr. Trudeau moved swiftly to make contact with officials in the new administration and reshaped his cabinet to promote ministers with experience in the United States. Mr. Trump made problems right away for the Canadian leader by giving the   to the Keystone XL pipeline, putting Mr. Trudeau in an uncomfortable position between environmentalists and oil producers. If Mr. Trump goes after Canada on trade issues, as seems likely, Mr. Trudeau is expected to become significantly more vocal and critical. But to date he has avoided public criticism of the American president, a reticence that may have helped over the weekend, after Mr. Trump?s executive order on immigration. Canada was able to get quick clarification from the White House that the directive would not affect the movement of Canadian citizens and dual nationals into the United States. After fumbling its initial response, Britain got essentially the same clarification 15 hours later, which London hailed as a result of its special relationship with Mr. Trump. While Britain may have been influential, however, the White House was already narrowing the initial interpretations of the executive order. But not before Mrs. May was attacked for timidity in the face of outrage by her own legislators and by the opposition. Still, the ?special relationship? has never been an equal one, so some degree of humiliation often goes with the territory. As one message on Twitter, posted by the user @Locke1689, a professed ?progressive conservative,? read: ?Actively snubbing the world?s only superpower would be gross diplomatic  . ?"
17924,Mujib Mashal,25/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"KABUL, Afghanistan  ?   The attorney general of Afghanistan has ordered the arrest of nine   bodyguards over accusations of rape and torture made by a political rival, and the vice president himself remains under investigation, officials said on Tuesday. The arrest warrants, confirmed by the attorney general?s office, came after Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, the more senior of Afghanistan?s two vice presidents, and his bodyguards refused to show up for questioning about the allegations, despite repeatedly being summoned by prosecutors. The case is testing the government?s resolve to deliver justice in the face of a potentially dangerous showdown between a powerful former warlord and the shaky coalition administration of which he is a part. Ahmad Ishchi, a    elder from General Dostum?s own Uzbek ethnic group, has accused the vice president of abducting him from a sports stadium in November, personally and repeatedly beating him, and ordering his men to sexually assault him with an assault rifle during five days of captivity in the northern province of Jowzjan. Attorney General Mohammad Farid Hamidi declined to discuss the case in detail on Tuesday but said that his prosecutors were focused on enforcing the law with precision. ?We are following the law in this case hair by hair,? Mr. Hamidi said. President Ashraf Ghani has said that he takes the allegations against General Dostum seriously and that the case will be handled fairly within the judicial system to show that no one is above the law. Mr. Ghani has told Western diplomats that he is tired of officials breaking the law with impunity, and he characterized the Dostum case as a    challenge to his government. But many have said that Mr. Ghani shares the blame for bringing General Dostum onto his ticket in the first place, despite grave concerns about the former warlord?s human rights record. Spokesmen and aides to General Dostum could not be reached for comment about the warrants on Tuesday, but in recent weeks, they have rejected the summons against him as unconstitutional. Bashir Ahmad Tayanj, a spokesman for General Dostum, said last month that the allegations were baseless and that the vice president had constitutional immunity from prosecution as part of the president?s elected ticket. In recent weeks, however, senior government officials say General Dostum?s aides have been in contact with the attorney general?s office, where they have been clearly told that the vice president has no choice but to cooperate. The general?s aides have asked for time, two senior officials said. Mr. Ishchi welcomed the news of the warrants and insisted that the bodyguards be arrested immediately. But he said justice would only be served once General Dostum?s fate had been made clear. ?Dostum committed an obvious crime, and when the crime is evident, the government can arrest the criminal even if he is a very   person,? he said. General Dostum is part of a generation of Afghan warlords who stand accused of human rights violations, mostly during the country?s civil war in the 1990s. But until now, most of those figures have seemed immune to the consequences, remaining in positions of power. Before issuing the summons for General Dostum, the attorney general sought the support of Mr. Ghani and the national security council, which includes all the security ministries. A detailed plan of action was discussed at a meeting of the council, at which all the agencies pledged support for the prosecutors. General Dostum?s supporters have insisted that Mr. Ishchi was not abducted but, rather, arrested by security forces on charges of aiding the Taliban in Jowzjan Province. ?Force, injury, and mistreatment  ?   we cannot deny that, because in the past these accusations have been there against Afghan forces, that they mistreat suspects during arrest and interrogation,? Mr. Tayanj said in the interview last month. But he denied the accusation of sexual assault. Both sides have also made emotional appeals to the public on the nightly news. On one news program, Mr. Tayanj presented a medical document that he said was from a government forensics examination he said it disproved Mr. Ishchi?s assertions of sexual assault but did not go into detail, simply brandishing the paper. A day later, Mr. Tayanj allowed two New York Times reporters to examine the document. It stated that there had been a wound next to Mr. Ishchi?s rectum but that it had been treated, making it difficult to determine what had caused it. Two other medical reports seen by The Times also attest to the presence of a significant wound. One was written by doctors at the United States military air base in Bagram, the other by doctors at the   Wazir Akbar Khan hospital, in Kabul. When the reporters pressed Mr. Tayanj about the wound, he said it was not evidence of sexual assault. ?If someone hits someone with a rifle, no matter where they hit, is that sexual assault? Sexual assault has its own specific meaning,? Mr. Tayanj said. ?They have made it seem as if he was an    girl who was taken and done something wrong to. ? Aides to General Dostum have called for traditional mediation by tribal elders to resolve the issue, flatly rejecting the judicial process. He is also said to have sent a delegation of elders to negotiate with Mr. Ishchi. Baktash Ishchi, one of Mr. Ishchi?s sons, said that they insisted on following the legal process and would not engage in traditional mediation. ?This is not an issue for traditional mediation  ?   it is not like he took our camel, so we accept a horse in return,? he said. ?There is a crime that has taken place. ?"
17350,Robert Pear,5/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"WASHINGTON  ?   Republicans hope to repeal major parts of the Affordable Care Act using an expedited procedure known as budget reconciliation. The process is sometimes called arcane, but it has been used often in the past 35 years to write some of the nation?s most important laws. ?Reconciliation is probably the most potent budget enforcement tool available to Congress for a large portion of the budget,? the Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan arm of Congress, has said. Here is a primer. Q. What is the budget reconciliation process? A. It is a way for Congress to speed action on legislation that changes taxes or spending, especially spending for entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Although conceived primarily as a way to reduce federal budget deficits, it has also been used to cut taxes and to create programs that increase spending  ?   changes that can raise deficits. In the Senate, a reconciliation bill can ordinarily be passed with a simple majority. For other bills, a   majority is often needed to limit debate and move to a final vote. Q. Why is it called reconciliation? A. The term originated in the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which was intended to give Congress more control over the budget process by allowing lawmakers to set overall levels of spending and revenue. The process begins with a budget blueprint, a resolution that guides Congress but is not presented to the president for a signature or veto. It recommends federal revenue, deficit, debt and spending levels in areas like defense, energy, education and health care. The resolution may direct one or more committees to develop legislation to achieve specified budgetary results. By adopting these proposals, Congress can change existing laws so that actual revenue and spending are brought into line with  ?   reconciled with  ?   policies in the budget resolution. Q. How has reconciliation been used? A. Since 1980, Congress has completed action on 24 budget reconciliation bills. Twenty became law. Four were vetoed. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 was a vehicle for much of the ?Reagan revolution. ? It squeezed savings out of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, the school lunch program, farm subsidies, student loans, welfare and jobless benefits, among many other programs. In 1996, Congress reversed six decades of social welfare policy, eliminating the individual entitlement to cash assistance for the nation?s poorest children and giving each state a lump sum of federal money with vast discretion over its use. Those changes were made in a reconciliation bill, pushed by Republicans but signed by President Bill Clinton. Congress reduced deficits with another reconciliation bill, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. That law also created the Children?s Health Insurance Program, primarily for uninsured children in   families. On the same day in 1997, Mr. Clinton signed a separate reconciliation bill that cut taxes. The Bush tax cuts were adopted in reconciliation bills signed by President George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003. On several occasions, Congress has increased assistance to   working families by increasing the   tax credit in reconciliation bills. Congress also made changes to the Affordable Care Act in a reconciliation bill passed immediately after President Obama signed the health care overhaul in 2010. Later, when Republicans controlled both houses of Congress, they passed a reconciliation bill to eviscerate the Affordable Care Act, but Mr. Obama vetoed the bill in January 2016. Republicans say that measure will provide a template or starting point for their efforts to undo the health care law this year, with support from   Donald J. Trump, who calls the law ?an absolute disaster. ? Q. How does the reconciliation process work in the Senate? A. In the House, leaders of the majority party can usually control what happens if their members stick together. In the Senate, by contrast, one member or a handful of senators can often derail the leaders? plans. The reconciliation process enhances the power of the majority party and its leaders. Senate debate on a reconciliation bill is normally limited to 20 hours, so it cannot be filibustered on the Senate floor. The Senate has a special rule to prevent abuse of the budget reconciliation process. The rule, named for former Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, generally bars use of the procedure to consider legislation that has no effect on spending, taxes and deficits. The Senate parliamentarian normally decides whether particular provisions violate the Byrd rule, but the Senate can waive the rule with a   majority. Q. What does this mean for the Affordable Care Act? A. Republicans hope to use the   procedure of budget reconciliation to repeal or nullify provisions of the law that affect spending and taxes. They could, for example, eliminate penalties imposed on people who go without insurance and on larger employers who do not offer coverage to employees. They could use a reconciliation bill to eliminate tens of billions of dollars provided each year to states that have expanded eligibility for Medicaid. And they could use it to repeal subsidies for private health insurance coverage obtained through the public marketplaces known as exchanges. Republicans could also repeal a number of taxes and fees imposed on certain   people and on health insurers and manufacturers of   prescription drugs and medical devices: tax increases that help offset the cost of the insurance coverage expansions. Those provisions were all rolled back in the reconciliation bill Mr. Obama vetoed last January. That bill did not touch insurance market standards established in the Affordable Care Act, which do not directly cost the government money or raise taxes. The standards stipulate, for example, that insurers cannot deny coverage or charge higher premiums because of a person?s   conditions. Insurers must allow parents to keep children on their policies until the age of 26, and they cannot charge women higher rates than men, as they often did in the past. Such provisions are politically popular, but it is not clear how they could remain in force without the coverage expansions that help insurers afford such regulations. Without an effective requirement for people to carry insurance, and without subsidies, supporters of the health law say many healthy people would go without coverage, knowing they could obtain it if they became ill and needed it. Democrats say they will fight to preserve the law after Mr. Obama leaves office. Recent history shows that lobbying and public pressure can sometimes make a difference, altering the votes of individual lawmakers and changing the contents of a reconciliation bill."
17366,Mattathias Schwartz,22/01/2017,2017,1,technology,"On the morning of May 18, 2014, Violeta Lagunes was perplexed by a series of strange messages that appeared in her Gmail inbox. It was Election Day to choose the leadership of Mexico?s   Partido Accin Nacional, or PAN, and Lagunes, a former federal congresswoman, was holding a strategy meeting in her office in Puebla city. The emails seemed harmless, at least at first. One appeared to come from the account of a trusted colleague. It asked her to download and review a document. Lagunes clicked on the link, but it seemed to be broken, so she wrote back to her colleague and asked him to send it again. Elsewhere in her inbox was an email from Google warning her that someone had tried to log in to her account. Meanwhile, she began to receive phone calls from PAN allies, who claimed that they had received emails from Lagunes?s account that she did not remember sending. Now Lagunes was worried. Around 1 o?clock, she called the colleague who appeared to have emailed her. She reached him at a restaurant, where he was finishing lunch with other campaign allies. ?I did not send you an email,? he insisted. A consultant with the campaign  ?   who asked to remain anonymous in order to preserve his relationships with other candidates  ?   overheard the conversation. He knew of other campaign workers who had been receiving similar messages: emails with vague subject lines, asking the recipient to review a document or click a link. The campaign, he realized, had been hacked. In the vote for party leader, Lagunes and her allies in Puebla  ?   a   drive southeast from Mexico City  ?   were supporting the challenger, a senator who promised to return the party to its conservative roots. But the incumbent was backed by Puebla?s powerful governor, Rafael Moreno Valle. One of Mexico?s rising political stars, Moreno Valle is close to Mexico?s president, Enrique Pe?a Nieto, and has forged an alliance between PAN and Nieto?s centrist Partido Revolucionario Institucional, or PRI, long the dominant force in Mexican politics. Since winning the governorship in 2010, Moreno Valle?s opponents say, his ambitions have grown, and he has resorted to increasingly harsh measures to keep Puebla state  ?   including members of his own party  ?   under control. ?In the beginning, the governor was   and respectful,? Rafael Micalco, a former leader of PAN in Puebla state, told me. ?When he became governor, he transformed. Now he controls the party through threats. ? This race to retain control of the party leadership in 2014 was a crucial test for the governor, who was rumored to be considering a run for Mexico?s presidency in 2018. (This past September, Moreno Valle publicly announced his intent to run.) Clashes between the two camps were especially intense in Puebla, where backers of the challenger, Ernesto Cordero, claimed that the governor was using public money to support the incumbent, Gustavo Madero, though the governor?s office has denied these charges. Shortly before the election, Madero?s campaign manager said that Cordero?s side was trying to undermine the legitimacy of the process. ?Their strategy is clear from the outset,? he said in an interview with a Mexican magazine. ??u2009?If I win, good. If not, I was cheated. ??u2009? After Lagunes?s call on Election Day, her colleagues rushed from the restaurant back to their local headquarters, a hotel conference room that they had nicknamed ?the bunker. ? All morning, they had been trying to reach their field network, a group of 40 Cordero canvassers who were working to get out the vote in Puebla state. But the field network seemed to have gone dark. Few of the canvassers were even answering their phones. Hackers, the team concluded, must have found the list of the canvassers? names and phone numbers  ?   widely circulated by email within the campaign  ?   and begun to intimidate them. ?The day before,? the consultant told me, the field network was ?motivated and eager to do this work. After the hack, it was very hard to reach them. The few who did answer said that they had received phone calls saying that their lives were at stake. They were worried that if they went out, they or their families would get hurt. ? According to another worker on Cordero?s campaign, who also requested anonymity, citing fear of reprisal, the message to the canvassers was simple and direct: ?We know who you are. If you don?t want any trouble, shut down your cellphone and stop your activity. ? The worker added: ?It?s an authoritarian regime. ? Madero won the election, with 57 percent of the 162, 792 votes cast over all. In Puebla, his margin was substantially larger, roughly 74 percent. Cordero?s team decided not to contest the result. They had suspicions about how they were hacked. But it would be another year before any evidence emerged. Their political enemies, leaked documents seemed to show, had built a spying operation using software made by an Italian firm called Hacking Team  ?   just one of many private companies that, largely below public notice, have sprung up to aid governments in surveilling the private lives of individual citizens. The industry claims that its products comply with local laws and are used to fight crime and terror. But in many countries around the world, these tools have proved to be equally adept at political espionage. On average, an American office worker sends and receives roughly 120 emails per day, a number that grows with each passing year. The ubiquity and utility of email has turned it into a   record of our    lives, rich with mundane and potentially embarrassing details, stored in a perpetual archive, accessible from anywhere on earth and protected, in some cases, by nothing more than a single password. In the case of Violeta Lagunes, her email login represented a point of vulnerability, a seam where the digital walls protecting her campaign were at the mercy of her human judgment  ?   specifically, whether she could determine if a message from an apparently reputable source was real or fake. Nearly two years later, John Podesta, chairman of Hillary Clinton?s campaign, was faced with a similar judgment call. An email warned him that someone in Ukraine had tried to access his Gmail account and asked him to click on a button and reset his password. His senior adviser forwarded the email to one of the campaign?s technology experts. ?This is a legitimate email,? he replied, in what the expert later would clarify was a simple typing error on his part he meant to say it was not legitimate. ?The gmail one is REAL,? the senior adviser wrote to Podesta and another aide. And so, like Lagunes, Podesta fell into a trap. The button appeared to lead to an official Google page, but it was in fact a meticulously personalized fake, with a domain address linked to a remote cluster of atolls in the South Pacific. The details were designed to trick Podesta into entering his password. This technique is known as ?spear phishing. ? It is an especially potent weapon against companies and political organizations because it needs to succeed only one time, against one target. After that, attackers can use the trusted identity of the first compromised account to more easily lure colleagues into opening infected attachments or clicking on malicious links. Not only will a working email password yield years of intraoffice chatter, invoices,   bills and confidential memos it can often be leveraged into control of other personal accounts  ?   Twitter, Facebook, Amazon  ?   and even access to company servers and internet domains. The Podesta and Lagunes episodes are far from the only cases in which hackers have used information from stolen emails as a weapon against an entire institution. The 2009 ?Climategate? incident, which exposed troves of emails from prominent climate researchers, began when hackers remotely broke into servers at a British university with the help of illicitly obtained passwords. The 2014 hack of internal Sony files, which American officials attributed to the North Korean government, began with a series of   emails that attackers then used to dig deeper into Sony?s servers. Each hack yielded the most private thoughts and deeds from the members of each respective organization: their blunt insults, their quashed dissents, their   plans, their smarmy flattery, all chronicled in time down to the hundredth of the second when the author clicked ?send. ? In an earlier era, the hackers might have had to engage in riskier behavior, like bribery or burglary. Now, in many cases, all they had to do was send along a link. The White House, C. I. A. and F. B. I. have all claimed that, based on classified evidence, they can trace the hacks of Podesta?s email account (and other hacks of people close to the Clinton campaign) back to the Russian government. But with the rise of private firms like Hacking Team, penetrating the email accounts of political opponents does not require the kind of money and expertise available to major powers. A   website called Insider Surveillance lists more than a dozen companies selling   ethical malware, including   Hacking Team and the German firms FinFisher and Trovicor. Compared with conventional arms, surveillance software is subject to few trade controls a recent attempt by the United States to regulate it under a   pact called the Wassenaar Arrangement failed. ?The technology is morally neutral,? says Joel Brenner, a former inspector general of the National Security Agency. ?The same program that you use to monitor your babysitter might be used by Bashar Assad or Abdel Fattah   to keep track of whomever they don?t like. ? Hacking Team has fewer than 50 employees, but it has customers all over the world. According to internal documents, its espionage tool, which is called the Remote Control System, or R. C. S. can be licensed for as little as $200, 000 a year  ?   well within the budget of a provincial strongman. After it has been surreptitiously installed on a target?s computer or phone, the Remote Control System can invisibly eavesdrop on everything: text messages, emails, phone and Skype calls, location data and so on. Whereas the N. S. A. ?s   programs grab data in transit from switching rooms and undersea cables, the R. C. S. acquires it at the source, right off a target?s device, before it can be encrypted. It carries out an invisible, digitized equivalent of a    . The United States government is almost certainly the world?s most formidable repository of hacking talent, but its most powerful cyberweapons are generally reserved for intelligence agencies and the military. This might explain why, according to company documents, at least two federal   agencies have been Hacking Team clients: the F. B. I. beginning in 2011, and the Drug Enforcement Administration, beginning in 2012. The F. B. I. contract paid Hacking Team more than $700, 000 the D. E. A. appears to have used the software to go after targets in Colombia. Documents show that the company has also sold its software to some of the world?s most repressive governments. Some, like those of Honduras, Ethiopia, Bahrain, Morocco, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, are Western allies. Other countries, like Uzbekistan and Turkey, have a more troubled relationship. A few are openly hostile to the West. Between 2012 and 2014, Hacking Team was paid nearly one million euros by the government of Sudan, a United   state sponsor of terrorism. Even more notable, in light of recent events, is the   relationship that Hacking Team carried on with the F. S. B. one of Russia?s main intelligence agencies. As with Puebla, Hacking Team used a middleman, a research agency called Kvant, to handle its sales to Russia. Between 2012 and 2014, the agency paid Hacking Team 451, 000 euros to license the Remote Control System. Hacking Team claims that it draws the line at customers who commit ?gross   abuses? and that it sells exclusively to governments operating within the laws of their own countries. In at least one case, David Vincenzetti, Hacking Team?s founder and chief executive, told a salesman to hold off on a potential Mexican client. ?We sell to official, governmental LEAs?  ?     agencies  ?   ?and security agencies ONLY,? Vincenzetti wrote in an email. But at other times, a more casual attitude prevailed inside the company. ?If one sells sandwiches to Sudan, he is not subject, as far as my knowledge goes, to the law,? one Hacking Team lawyer wrote in an internal email. ?Hacking Team should be treated like a sandwich vendor. ? When asked about its arrangements in various countries, the company responded that it ?does not comment on confidential business dealings. ? Its American spokesman, Eric Rabe, did tell me that neither Russia nor Sudan is a current Hacking Team customer. (The relationships, Rabe wrote, ended in 2014, Russia because ?the Putin government evolved from one considered friendly to the West to a more hostile regime? and Sudan ?because of concerns about the country?s ability to use the system in accordance with the H. T. contract. ?) Separately, the company confirmed that the state of Puebla was, in fact, a former client. Until recently, most of what was known about the world of private surveillance companies was a matter of hearsay and speculation. Industry players kept a low profile, operating discreetly from rented offices and meeting potential customers in person a few times a year at carefully screened trade shows. This is why it was so notable when, in July 2015, an unusual tweet appeared in Hacking Team?s Twitter feed. ?Since we have nothing to hide,? it read, ?we?re publishing all our emails, files and source code. ? Then came another tweet, with links to a downloadable file called Hacked Team. The file was huge, 420 gigabytes of material scraped from Hacking Team?s internal servers. Inside were 33 folders containing the company?s contracts, payroll documents, invoices, legal memos,   records and a   cache of email correspondence from the chief executive on down. Hacking Team had itself been hacked. WikiLeaks pounced on the breach and quickly uploaded the emails into a searchable database. Anyone with an internet connection could now read the chief executive joking about how his company was in the business of selling ?the evilest technology on earth. ? You could browse Hacking Team?s source code, including one line using ?bomb_blueprints. pdf? as a placeholder for files that might be found on a target?s device. On Reddit, an online peanut gallery formed around the   online habits of one Hacking Team engineer and his own notably weak passwords  ?   HTPassword! P4ssword, Passw0rd. But the most damaging exposures in the leak by far were Hacking Team?s client list and the names of some of the clients? targets. In South Korea, newspapers focused on evidence suggesting that Hacking Team?s software had helped the nation?s intelligence service rig an election after the leak, one agent who had reportedly used the system there committed suicide. In Ecuador, a magazine found an email with seven phone numbers that the government appeared to have targeted with the R. C. S. Three belonged to lawmakers a fourth to the mayor of Quito all four were members of the opposition party. With the source code for the Remote Control System now public, the company and its clients had to stop using it temporarily. By the end of the year, though, Hacking Team had updated its product and was trying to rebuild its reputation. I was curious whether a company that profited from online breaches could recover from its own. Eric Rabe, the American spokesman, sounded eager to meet me for coffee in Philadelphia. A grandfather and former   anchor, he exudes   credibility. ?If you disagree with someone on the internet,? he said, of the Hacked Team files, with a wave of his hand, ?there?s no need to have a   debate. Just go destroy them. ? A couple of months later, I went to Milan to visit Hacking Team?s headquarters, a stately gray apartment building with boxes of limp flowers adorning a few of its sooty sills. Waiting to demonstrate the company?s software were Rabe Philippe Vinci, a company vice president and Alessandro Scarafile, a young engineer. Scarafile had gathered a Dell desktop computer and three smartphones: iPhone, BlackBerry and Android. The screen from his own laptop, which represented the console of a client intelligence agency, was projected on the wall. Several icons represented the various streams of data that could potentially be acquired by gaining control of the target?s computer: images from   cameras, sound from   mikes, screenshots, detailed records of applications opened and bitcoins transferred, a continuous log of location with latitude and longitude, and logs of address books, calendars, phone calls, Skype calls and passwords, as well as websites visited. A key logger recorded every key that was pressed. It was a lot to keep track of. Two other views, called ?line of events? and ?line of actions,? assembled the information into chronological order. Scarafile, who was playing both the customer and the target, or ?bad guy,? turned on the Dell. Judging by the background on the desktop, a gothic scene framed by castlelike silhouettes, our target seemed to be planning a terrorist attack from Transylvania. There are three methods, Scarafile explained, for getting the Remote Control System onto a target?s device. Customers can gain physical access to the device and then infect it with a USB stick or memory card. They can beam the R. C. S. in over a   network. Or they can send the customer an email and get him to click on an infected attachment  ?   usually a file from a   program like Microsoft Word or PowerPoint. Scarafile did not mention a fourth method, one described by Hacking Team?s critics and referred to in its internal emails: the installation of the R. C. S. through a more elaborate process called ?network injection,? which is said to involve pinpointing the target?s exact location on the internet, observing the person as he orders up, say, a YouTube cat video, and then serving up a doctored version of the same page, one with the desired cat video playing in the foreground  ?   YouTube logo and all  ?   as the R. C. S. discreetly rolls in past the digital gates. Whatever the method of infection, the malicious code, known as an ?agent,? then communicates with its masters anonymously, its dispatches routed through a series of dedicated servers scattered around the world. Even if the target gets suspicious and figures out that something is wrong, this chain of servers makes it nearly impossible for him to figure out exactly who is using Hacking Team?s product to spy on him. For the demo, Scarafile opted for the third method, which he referred to as ?a bit of social engineering. ? Using the customer?s computer, he sent the target an email with a Word file attached. Then he returned to the target?s computer and   on it, just as Lagunes had clicked on the link in her inbox. ?From now on,? he said, ?this system is currently infected, or monitored, by the Remote Control System. ? It would remain so even if the suspect turned off his machine or logged out. On the timeline, the target appeared as a stubbly lout in an undershirt, named ?Jimmy Page . .. head of the terrorist cell. ? Using Jimmy Page?s Dell, Scarafile logged into Page?s Gmail, Facebook and Twitter. He opened up Skype, perused Page?s criminal colleagues (Don Corleone, Harry Potter, Keyser Soze) and left one of them a voice mail message from Page?s phone. Accessing a USB drive attached to the infected computer, Scarafile opened an encrypted file that turned out to contain an order to ?kill David Vincenzetti. ? R. C. S. captured it all, including periodic snapshots of Scarafile, as Page, at work. ?I don?t like the words ?inject? and ?infect,??u2009? Vinci, the vice president, said. ?R. C. S. is deploying the agent into the device of the target because you want to monitor some of his activities. Exactly the way that law enforcement is listening to some of your phone calls, right?? Rabe had told me that Vincenzetti was ?a fighter,? and his combative side was apparent from a collage of magazine clippings and printouts taped to the wall beside his desk  ?   a sort of mood board, like those used in the advertising industry to gather inspiration before the unveiling of a new brand. Vincenzetti?s mood board, though, wasn?t about sneakers or cola. It was about the global struggle for power, which he seemed to envision as one big conflict, a battle between the good guys and the bad guys. On the good side was a photo of the bell that aspiring Navy SEALs can ring should they want to quit the program during Hell Week, and a quote from another entrepreneur that ?business is war. ? On the bad side, Vincenzetti had taped up a satellite image showing one of the hottest zones of international tension, the artificial islands rising in the South China Sea, a line of terrestrial pawns advancing China?s sphere of influence. Beside it was a chart about Iran, depicting how the country could continue to advance its nuclear program despite the recent   deal. ?I think the Iran deal is just terrible,? Vincenzetti said, and then added, sarcastically, ?Oh, it?s such a very peaceful expansion. Very peaceful. ? ?That is not an official company position,? Rabe interjected. Vincenzetti, now 48, is a familiar type  ?   a ferociously competitive, driven entrepreneur whose existence is organized around his work. He has a wife, who was born in Morocco, and no children. His small,   eyes can make him seem sleepily blas?. On the morning we met at Hacking Team?s offices, he wore jeans, a   cardigan and a striped shirt, unbuttoned to midchest. He seemed more comfortable on his feet than sitting down. As we talked in a conference room, he periodically leapt to his feet and stalked around the table, considering in turn the espresso machine, the view from the window, a case of bottled water. ?If I wanted to break into this room, how would I do it?? he asked. ?There is a door, and there are two windows. ? He pressed his hands against the glass panes. ?The perimeter is the first thing you must secure,? he continued. Securing data was what he did earlier in his career. Now he had moved on. ?If you cannot break into a bank, you cannot protect a bank. So when you are in security, really there is no difference between thinking offensively and defensively. ? In the   Vincenzetti?s parents, a salesman and a schoolteacher, bought him a Commodore 64, one of the earliest personal computers. He soon created a   clone, a Tron   game and a   adventure game. As a   student at the University of Milan in the ?90s, he became fascinated by cryptography he corresponded with programmers around the world about new cryptographic theories and wrote code for email encryption. In his senior year, he was appointed to administer the university?s internal network, a post that was usually reserved for a graduate student. Vincenzetti remembers these early days as a time when ?everything was free and no one was trying to harm you. We were wide open and accessible. All the best were called hackers, and I was a hacker. ? Vincenzetti left university early and founded three companies, all of them focused on defensive cybersecurity. After he founded Hacking Team in 2003, he tried to sell his services to Italian police agencies but found them skeptical that Mafiosi and other   criminals would ever bother to encrypt their communications. In Italy, the police were also used to getting whatever they needed through wiretaps, arranged with varying degrees of formality through their contacts at telecommunications firms. But after the 2004 Madrid train bombings, which were coordinated via cellphones and the internet, police officers and intelligence agents not just in Italy but all across Europe became interested in contracting with   vendors, part of an emerging arms race over   encryption. The growth of Skype made it easy for users to encrypt their communications, and the authorities were eager to pay for countermeasures like the Remote Control System. Singapore, Hacking Team?s first   client, signed on in 2008. The company?s Middle Eastern business took off in 2011, a boom that coincided with the beginning of the Arab Spring. By then, Hacking Team had entered a growth phase, its business driven in part by demand among   governments for   surveillance tools. According to two former employees, the company held talks with Col. Muammar  ?s chief security officer, who wanted to build a countrywide   scheme that could be embedded in every Libyan cellphone. (Rabe would not confirm or deny that this meeting occurred, and added: ?The company often receives requests to provide services that it does not have available or would sell. ?) The United Nations, which prohibits the export of ?electronic weaponry? to Sudan, has investigated Hacking Team?s activities there. Nineteen members of the Italian Parliament signed a petition raising the question of whether the Egyptian government might have used the R. C. S. to track Giulio Regeni, a    Italian student who appears to have been under government surveillance and whose mutilated body turned up on the side of a road in Egypt last year. Hacking Team?s software has not been connected to the case, but the company has done business with the current Egyptian regime. As part of the controversy, the Italian government temporarily revoked Hacking Team?s global export license, so that for several months the company had to file a separate application for each of its customers outside the European Union. (When I brought up the Regeni case with Rabe, he called the dead student ?this Italian national who got himself killed in Egypt. ? He cited Hacking Team?s official policy  ?   the company neither knows nor desires to know the identities of the people its customers choose to target. ?There is no evidence that Hacking Team?s software had anything to do with Regeni?s demise,? Rabe said.) All Hacking Team customers sign contracts agreeing to comply with local laws. The company says that it vets potential customers and studies reports from journalists and   groups, looking for ?objective evidence or credible concerns? that its products are being abused. But when it comes to Hacking Team?s own interactions with customers, leaked documents suggest that employees have sometimes turned a blind eye. In the case of the Puebla government and other Latin American customers, Hacking Team employees appeared to ignore warnings suggesting that the Remote Control System was being used to gather intelligence on the political opposition. On multiple occasions, customers emailed Hacking Team attachments with   content, including polling data, party registration forms and invitations addressed to and signed by elected officials. Rather than ask what these files had to do with fighting crime and drug trafficking, Hacking Team   members simply emailed them back, as requested, with an embedded ?exploit,? turning the document into a surveillance tool to be used against whomever it was sent on to. Asked about these cases, Rabe replied that customers ?are not supposed to be using it for political purposes, but I don?t think it?s reasonable to expect that an Italian computer programmer,? i. e. a support technician, ?would have seen these files and known what was going on. . .. I think that?s a stretch, that an Italian software guy could know that an individual is a dissident. ? Hacking Team?s most persistent critic is Citizen Lab, a research group at the University of Toronto?s Munk School of Global Affairs. Before the Hacked Team leak, Citizen Lab documented cases in which Hacking Team software turned up on the devices of activists in Morocco and the United Arab Emirates, as well as an   journalist in Alexandria, Va. Ronald Deibert, Citizen Lab?s director, told me that Hacking Team ?is a company that appears to have no internal controls on abuse of its products. ? When I asked Vincenzetti about this, he said that Citizen Lab was motivated by money, noting that the group won a   grant a week after publishing a report on Hacking Team?s sales to Ethiopia. ?Their identity,? he said, ?is: ?I am the defender of free speech, I am the defender of liberty and democracy.? O. K. So am I. So is every rational guy. ? If Citizen Lab really cared about good and evil, he said, it would be fighting China and Iran. Almost immediately after the Hacked Team documents went online, they were being pored over by R3D, a Mexico     group. Luis Fernando Garc­a, R3D?s director, says that intimidation and online surveillance have increased under Pe?a Nieto?s presidency, and he took notice when Citizen Lab, in 2014, released a report that traced a chain of servers associated with Hacking Team that routed data through Hong Kong, London, Amsterdam and Atlanta before terminating somewhere inside Mexico. Exactly who was on the receiving end of the traffic and what they were doing with it was unknown at the time, but now R3D?s team recognized that this could be their chance to find out. Shortly thereafter, R3D published three invoices from the Hacked Team cache showing that one state government  ?   that of Jalisco, on the Pacific Coast  ?   had paid the company nearly half a million euros for the Remote Control System. Soon other documents were found in the leak to implicate several more states, including Puebla, though most of the states denied ever using the software. (Jalisco later admitted to purchasing the system, which it claimed was for its prosecutor?s office.) The story failed to get much traction in the Mexican press, except in Puebla, after R3D connected with Lado B, a small   collective there. The site?s name translates to ?B Side,? as in the back of a hit single  ?   symbolizing its dedication to telling stories that would otherwise go untold. Lado B?s editor, Ernesto Aroche, was not surprised that Puebla?s government had been using the Remote Control System. In Moreno Valle?s six years as governor there, he has spent lavishly on new surveillance systems, including multiple ?security arches,?   structures that scrutinize traffic with video cameras and   and whose cost had raised some questions in the local press. Beginning in 2013, Aroche began noticing solicitations on the   website for hidden cameras and other spying equipment. When he filed a   request about them, the government?s form response indicated that these orders had never been filled, but Aroche was skeptical, given the mounting evidence that Moreno Valle?s administration had begun using its security apparatus for political purposes. There were periodic   of homes belonging to dissident politicians and journalists, with the burglars sometimes taking little besides their victims? laptops. Politicians would answer calls from unknown numbers, only to hear their own taped conversations played back to them. Another journalist, Fernando Maldonado, received an unmarked envelope full of what were purportedly transcripts of 400 private phone calls made by Puebla politicians. As Aroche and R3D sifted through the Hacked Team file dump, they discovered that the files on Puebla had more detail than those dealing with Hacking Team?s other Mexican accounts. The Puebla client often wrote emails asking for help with infecting a particular document with a malicious virus. Some of these came from an account  ?   soporteuiamx@gmail. com  ?   that also appears in many of Hacking Team?s internal support tickets. One of those tickets documents a client?s request for help in infecting an attachment: an invitation to attend an event for a Mexican political organization, signed by Violeta Lagunes and addressed to another party colleague opposed to the governor. Aroche interviewed politicians and journalists who were on the receiving end of the infected emails contained in the Hacked Team trove. According to a 2015 article that Lado B published in conjunction with a politics website, the Puebla group sent Hacking Team at least 47 requests to infect specific files that it would then forward on to their targets. Almost all of those files had to do with political issues. Going through the Hacked Team materials, Aroche found the name of a Puebla government employee who seemed to be working within the spying operation. ?Before, we had been talking about ghosts,? Aroche told me. ?Now, we could prove it. We started putting names on the actors. ? More than a year later, there have been no political repercussions for the governor or his allies in Puebla. I met Aroche this fall at the Lado B offices, a small room facing a courtyard in a crumbling stone building from P"
17369,Binyamin Appelbaum,5/01/2017,2017,1,crime,"WASHINGTON  ?   Federal Reserve officials expect Donald J. Trump?s election to result in somewhat faster economic growth over the next several years, but they see little chance of the boom Mr. Trump has promised, according to an account of the Fed?s most recent meeting in  . That is in part because the Fed plans to raise interest rates more quickly if growth accelerates. For now, however, Fed officials plan to wait and see what happens next, the account said. ?While the Fed signaled that it would likely respond to expansionary fiscal policies with a faster pace of rate hikes, the Fed believes it is too early to embed this into its baseline,? Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays, wrote on Wednesday following the release of the minutes. ?Any real shift in the stance of monetary policy will require more clarity on the stance of fiscal policy. ? At the December meeting, the Fed raised its benchmark rate for just the second time since 2008, citing the continued expansion of the economy and the steady decline of unemployment. The Fed debated and delayed that increase for most of last year, but the account published on Wednesday  ?   after a standard   delay  ?   described the final decision as uncontroversial. Officials instead spent the meeting talking about what comes next. Mr. Trump has promised a bevy of major changes in economic policy, including tax cuts and spending increases, reductions in regulation, and restrictions on trade and immigration. As a result, the account said, Fed officials regard both faster growth and slower growth as more likely than before the election, when the economy seemed locked into its longstanding pattern of slow and steady growth. ?The job of conducting U. S. monetary policy has not become any easier over recent months,? said James Marple, senior economist at TD Bank, referring to the increased uncertainty. The Fed, led by Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman, predicted in December that it would raise rates three times this year. The account said officials were not yet ready to predict how the pace of rate increases might change as a result of new policies pursued by Mr. Trump and Congress. ?Participants emphasized their uncertainty about the timing, size and composition of any future fiscal and other economic policy initiatives as well as about how those policies might affect aggregate demand and supply,? the minutes said. The Fed?s   committee, the Federal Open Market Committee, has 17 members, 10 of whom cast votes on monetary policy. The Fed?s caution amounts to a bias in favor of growth. The economy is expanding at roughly the pace Fed officials regard as sustainable. The work force is growing slowly as more baby boomers retire, and productivity is rising slowly. Two percent growth may be about as good as it gets. Ms. Yellen has warned that fiscal stimulus, like a tax cut or a spending increase, could increase economic growth to an unsustainable pace in the near term, resulting in increased inflation. The Fed quite likely would seek to offset such policies by raising interest rates more quickly. Instead of acting   the Fed is choosing to wait for more information. But the minutes said officials were concerned about the challenge of communicating their increased uncertainty. They want to be clear that the Fed?s prediction about the pace of rate increases depends on its prediction about economic growth. Faster growth will mean faster increases. The account said Fed officials were confident in their ability to raise rates quickly enough to prevent overheating, seeing ?only a modest risk? of a ?sharp acceleration in prices. ? By holding rates at low levels, the Fed has sought to increase economic growth by encouraging borrowing and   higher rates reduce the stimulative effect. The benchmark rate now sits in a range from 0. 5 percent to 0. 75 percent, still very low by historical standards. ?Consumers have no reason to panic about the rate hike last month, or even about additional rate increases in 2017,? said Alan MacEachin, chief corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. He noted that the last rate hike would add $1 to the monthly payment on a $5, 000 credit card balance. The economic forecast prepared by the Fed?s staff for the December meeting anticipated that Mr. Trump?s election would result in ?slightly higher? growth over the next several years. It said a likely increase in fiscal stimulus would be ?substantially counterbalanced? by higher interest rates and a stronger dollar, which would reduce exports of American goods and services. Several Fed officials reported that Mr. Trump?s election had increased optimism among business executives in their districts. ?Some contacts thought that their businesses could benefit from possible changes in federal spending, tax and regulatory policies,? the minutes said. The minutes also noted, however, that some executives were concerned about the negative impact of proposed policy changes. In a recent interview, John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said many executives in his district, which encompasses the western United States, worried about the potential impact of restrictions on immigration and on foreign trade, both of which have been important drivers of regional growth. Businesses across the country also reported increased difficulty in hiring qualified workers, the minutes said. The unemployment rate fell to just 4. 6 percent in November. The lack of readily available workers could further limit the benefits of a fiscal stimulus."
18113,Peter S. Goodman,3/02/2017,2017,2,business,"LONDON  ?   America?s traditional allies are on the lookout for new friends. They have heard the mantra ?America First? from the new president, divining a Trump doctrine: global cooperation last. Europeans have taken note of Mr. Trump?s denigration of the European Union and his apparent esteem for the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin. In Asia and Latin America, leaders have absorbed the deepening possibility that Mr. Trump will deliver on threats to impose punitive tariffs on Mexican and Chinese imports, provoking a trade war that will damage economic growth and eliminate jobs around the world. Some allies are shifting focus to other potential partners for new sources of trade and investment, relationships that could influence political, diplomatic and military ties. Many are looking to China, which has adroitly capitalized on a leadership vacuum in world affairs by offering itself  ?   ironies notwithstanding  ?   as a champion for global engagement. ?We?ve always said that America is our best friend,? Jeroen Dijsselbloem, president of the Eurogroup  ?   comprising finance ministers from countries sharing the euro currency  ?   said in an interview with The New York Times on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this month. ?If that?s no longer the case, if that?s what we need to understand from Donald Trump, then of course Europe will look for new friends. ? ?China is a very strong candidate for that,? he added. ?The Chinese involvement in Europe in terms of investment is already very high and expanding. If you push away your friends, you mustn?t be surprised if the friends start looking for new friends. ? On Wednesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany spoke by telephone with Premier Li Keqiang of China. ?The two spoke in favor of free trade and a stable world trade order,? a German government spokesman later said in a written statement. The swift reassessment of trade relations  ?   a realm in which Mr. Trump is directly threatening the order that has prevailed since the end of World War II  ?   only amplifies the potential for a   of the broader geopolitical framework. Mr. Trump has already criticized NATO as obsolete while demanding that member states pay more, calling into question the alliance that has maintained security across much of Europe for more than six decades. He has provoked fears of a clash with China beyond issues of commerce by taking a congratulatory call from the president of Taiwan, the   island that Beijing claims as part of its territory. In shutting American borders to people from predominantly Muslim countries, Mr. Trump risks inflaming tensions with Middle Eastern nations while widening a void with democratic allies over basic values. Through the fractious campaign, weary sophisticates dismissed the extreme talk from the Trump camp as political bluster. Even if he won, he would never follow through on his threats, particularly in trade where his business sensibilities would prevail. But that conventional wisdom looks to be crumbling. First, Mr. Trump delivered on a promise to withdraw from the   Partnership, a trade agreement forged by the Obama administration in part as a counter to China?s growing influence. Then, on Thursday, his administration appeared to embrace a Republican proposal to impose a 20 percent tax on all imported goods while asserting the proceeds would pay for a wall along the Mexican border. Word of the tax emerged as President Enrique Pe?a Nieto of Mexico canceled a visit to Washington to protest the promised wall  ?   resonating as the potential first salvo in a trade war. ?I?m incredibly concerned that the Trump people mean what they say,? said Chad P. Bown, a trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ?One would hope that they are using this as a negotiating tactic. But even if you are, that?s an extraordinarily dangerous game to play, because, right now, the communication to the world is not flowing clearly. ? The communication on Thursday came through Mr. Trump?s press secretary, Sean Spicer, who during the administration of George W. Bush, promoted the   magic of free trade as a spokesman for the United States Trade Representative. Pressed to explain how Mr. Trump would force Mexico to pay for the wall, Mr. Spicer said an import tax would do the trick. He soon clarified the tax was merely one option on a crowded buffet table. At a news conference on Friday, Mr. Trump reported having had ?a very good call? with the Mexican president. But he did not sound conciliatory. Mexico ?has outnegotiated us and beat us to a pulp through our past leaders,? he said. ?I?m not going to let that happen. ? Within the business world, the prospect of substantial tariffs seems so damaging that many assume it will never happen. Three decades ago, Alan Russell, a former commercial airline pilot, set up the Tecma Group of Companies, which runs factory operations for multinationals in Mexico. Today, the company employs some 7, 000 Mexican laborers, most of them in factories clustered around Ciudad Juÿrez. They make components for the automotive, electronics, aerospace and medical device industries. Mr. Trump?s words have provoked fear among the members of Mr. Russell?s work force. ?They hear the administration is going to shut down Nafta and deport everyone, and it scares them,? he said, referring to the North American Free Trade Agreement. But in the end, he said, business will carry on. ?In 31 years, I?ve been through rapid inflation, devaluations, three major recessions, the violence period and multiple presidential administrations, and every year trade has increased,? he said. ?We?ve been through worse. Trade is like life itself. It will figure a way. ? Most experts have similarly assumed the responsibilities of governance would temper Mr. Trump?s trade posture. Given that nearly   of all American trade is conducted with China and Mexico, a rupture risks severe economic damage. The three countries are intertwined in the global supply chain. China makes components that go into auto parts manufactured in the United States. Those parts are delivered to factories in Mexico that produce finished vehicles sold to Americans. Calling such vehicles Mexican imports misses that much of the value is produced in the United States, employing American labor. ?The idea of trade wars these days, what politicians have in mind is really a   or early   conception of trade,? said Gianmarco I. P. Ottaviano, a trade economist at the London School of Economics. ?You don?t even know who you?re going to hurt with these kind of things. You?re probably going to destroy American jobs in the end. ? Mr. Trump owes his office in no small measure to factory workers who have come to view global trade as a mortal threat to their livelihoods. But their sentiments are grounded not in ideology, but in a desire for jobs at decent wages. If Mr. Trump impedes imports, he could put some of these voters out of work. Beyond the economic effects, Mr. Trump?s refashioning of trade has already altered global alignments. In emphasizing ?America First,? Mr. Trump has generated a widespread sense that the country is surrendering its global leadership position. Britain?s abandonment of the European Union has enhanced the view that a period of international integration has devolved to a new era in which nationalist concerns are paramount. On Friday, as Mr. Trump hosted British Prime Minister Theresa May, he only increased the sense that he disdains Europe. ?Brexit?s going to be a wonderful thing for your country,? he told Ms. May at a news conference, before recounting his frustrations with the union?s bureaucracy. ?Getting the approvals from Europe was very, very tough. ? With both countries pursuing nationalist aspirations and multilateral institutions seemingly endangered, the world suddenly seems short of responsible supervision. China is working to assume the mantle. President Xi Jinping of China last week used an address in Davos, to submit his nation?s bid as a reliable champion of expanded trade. China does not have free elections. China jails labor organizers, while lavishing credit on   enterprises. All of this makes Mr. Xi an ironic choice as an icon for free trade. Yet Mr. Xi?s speech was so successful that it won the embrace of business people and world leaders alike. At a lunch in Davos two days after Mr. Xi?s address, a   private equity fund manager, Andr?   stood in a dining room full of more than 100 people and predicted the dawning of a new era. ?We heard a Chinese president becoming the leader of the free world,? he said."
17427,Kate Taylor,7/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"The city?s Education Department plans to close or merge nine schools next year that are part of its   turnaround initiative, among a group of 22 schools to be closed or merged, according to a document obtained by The New York Times. Mayor Bill de Blasio came into office saying that unlike his predecessor Michael R. Bloomberg, he would support struggling schools rather than close them, and he initiated the Renewal program in 2014 to offer extra money and services for 94 of the city?s   schools. ?We reject the notion of giving up on any of our schools,? Mr. de Blasio said at the time. Instead, he said, the city would infuse the schools in the program with resources, including coaches to help teachers improve their practices, new staff members to tackle problems like attendance, and social services like dental clinics or counseling. He said his administration might still end up closing schools, but he suggested that most schools would be given three years to improve. The program is now halfway through its third year. The department assigned each school a set of benchmarks in areas like attendance, graduation rate and, for elementary and middle schools, performance on state reading and math exams. But the schools have shown uneven progress. Eight schools in the program met all of their targets last year, while four schools met none, and 17 others met only one or two out of six or seven targets. Many schools in the program have also seen their enrollment decline as families shun schools labeled failing. The city previously decided to close or merge eight Renewal schools, so the latest round of closings will bring to 17 the number of schools in the program that will no longer be operating, at least as before. Six of the schools will be closed entirely: Junior High School 162 Lola Rodriguez de Tio, which had been singled out by the state as persistently failing, and whose closing was previously announced Leadership Institute, a high school Junior High School 145 Arturo Toscanini and Monroe Academy for Visual Arts and Design, all in the Bronx and Middle School 584 and the Essence School, also a middle school, in Brooklyn. The schools to be closed are all   to be sure. In the   school year, only 8 percent of the students at J. H. S. 145 passed the state reading tests, and only 3 percent passed the state?s math tests. Even so, it is not clear that they are necessarily the worst among the schools in the program. All of the six schools met at least one of the goals assigned by the city last year. Some are being closed for low enrollment as well.  The three schools in the program to be merged are the Young Scholars Academy of the Bronx, a middle school Frederick Douglass Academy IV, a high school in Brooklyn and Automotive High School in Brooklyn. All three schools already share their buildings with the schools they are being merged into, which are not in the Renewal program. The city is also proposing to merge five other pairs of schools, none of which are in the Renewal program, but many of which have struggled with academic achievement and enrollment. The Education Department declined to comment on the decision to close or merge the schools. The Bloomberg administration closed many large schools to start new, small ones. Studies have found that many small schools had positive effects on graduation rates and college enrollment. But not all the small schools were successful. The current city schools chancellor, Carmen Fari?a, has shown a preference for large schools and has said that some schools were too small to be sustainable. All of the closings and mergers will have to be approved by the Panel for Educational Policy, a citywide body. Aaron Pallas, a professor of sociology and education at Columbia University?s Teachers College, said, ?The fact that the city thinks that it needs to do this for six out of the roughly 80 or so left suggests that things are not going as well as they?d like. ? At the same time, he said, ?If these mergers and closures result in new schools that have a new kind of energy, perhaps different staff, perhaps a different culture, that may be better than trying to continue turning around schools that have been struggling for a very long time. ?"
17907,"Maggie Haberman, Jennifer Steinhauer and Charlie Savage",25/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"? White House press secretary Sean Spicer stood by President Trump?s false assertion that millions of illegal voters gave Hillary Clinton her popular vote win. ? Gag orders seem to be proliferating throughout the federal bureaucracy, but the national parks are taking to Twitter to speak up. ? A new national security political action committee, assembled by former intelligence officers and national security officials, has begun posting ?no spin? research on the president?s business interests abroad. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, confirmed on Tuesday that President Trump has long believed that millions of undocumented immigrants voted illegally in the 2016 election, furthering a false claim from the podium of the West Wing briefing room and refusing to rule out an investigation down the road. ?He said 3 to 5 million people could have voted illegally, based on the studies that he?s seen,? Mr. Spicer told stunned reporters, acknowledging a statement that Mr. Trump made privately in a meeting with congressional leaders on Monday afternoon. Mr. Trump and his aides repeatedly suggested during the transition period that ?irregularities? contributed to his   loss by nearly 3 million ballots to Hillary Clinton. Mr. Trump won the Electoral College, but his    popular vote loss to Mrs. Clinton was the largest for a winning presidential candidate since the disputed election of 1876. Democrats and some Republicans have pointed to that margin to claim that Mr. Trump is an illegitimate president. Such assertions have rankled Mr. Trump deeply. A November 2016 blog post on Infowars, the conspiracy   website run by radio host Alex Jones, posited the idea that roughly 3 million people voted illegally. Mr. Jones has hosted Mr. Trump on his radio show in the past. The assertion was based on tweets from a   voter expert, who claimed to have a study. However, there?s no evidence of the study. And officials in swing states where Mr. Trump secured victory, many of which are governed by Republicans, say that there is no evidence of such fraud. Mr. Spicer also made vague reference to another Pew Research Center study that supposedly backed up Mr. Trump, but the author of the study in question, David Becker, now executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, tweeted again that no such fraud happened. When a reporter pointed out to Mr. Spicer that such widespread fraud would be one of the biggest scandals in American electoral history and asked why the administration isn?t investigating, the press secretary said, ?Maybe we will. ? Mr. Spicer, who worked at the Republican National Committee before working for Mr. Trump, declined to say whether he personally believes this claim. ?What does it mean for democracy?? a reporter asked about Mr. Trump?s belief. ?It means that I?ve answered your question,? Mr. Spicer said. With reports proliferating about executive branch agencies under gag orders, Mr. Spicer told reporters that the White House is ?looking into it,? though he didn?t exactly deny it. ?I don?t think it?s any surprise that when there?s an administration turnover, that we?re going to review the policies,? he said. It started when the National Park Service retweeted crowd shots this weekend attesting to a smaller audience for President Trump?s inauguration than for Barack Obama?s first in 2009. That prompted a blackout, then an apology, then lots of pretty pictures. ?They had inappropriately violated their own social media policies,? Mr. Spicer said. ?There was guidance that was put out to the department to act in compliance with the rules that were set forth. ? Well, looks like Badlands National Park has gone rogue. But it looks like    out there. Poor man wanna be rich. Rich man wanna be king. And a king ain?t satisfied, Till he rules everything. ?Badlands,? Bruce Springsteen Daring Mr. Trump to make good on his grand infrastructure promises, Senate Democrats on Tuesday will unveil a   plan to rebuild the nation?s roads, railways, airports, waterways and sewer systems over 10 years. ?From our largest cities to our smallest towns, communities across the country are struggling to meet the challenges of aging infrastructure,? Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, will say. ?Our urban and rural communities have their own unique set of infrastructure priorities, and this proposal would provide funding to address those needed upgrades that go beyond the traditional road and bridge repair. ? Republicans resisted President Barack Obama?s push for an infrastructure ?surge? for eight years, arguing that the federal government couldn?t afford it and that state and local governments should shoulder more responsibility for improvements. But Mr. Trump has taken up the Democratic cause. ?We will build new roads, and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across our wonderful nation,? he vowed in his Inaugural Address. The plan dedicates $180 billion to rail and bus systems, $65 billion to ports, airports and waterways, $110 billion for water and sewer systems, $100 billion for energy infrastructure, and $20 billion for public and tribal lands. ?We?re asking President Trump to work with us to make it a reality,? Mr. Schumer will say. Next up from the Trump White House news fire hose: a nominee for the Supreme Court. President Trump has invited Senators Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, as well as both the chairman and ranking Democrat of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to the White House at 3 p. m. Tuesday to discuss the nearly   vacancy on the Supreme Court. The president said a nomination would be announced next week. ?We will pick a totally great Supreme Court justice,? Mr. Trump told reporters at the end of an event where he signed executive actions. Mr. McConnell, on the Senate floor Tuesday, said, ?I appreciate the president soliciting our advice on this important matter. ? Mr. McConnell blocked consideration of any nominee to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last February, during the final year of President Obama?s term. Former intelligence officers and national security officials have formed a new national security political action committee, called 4DPac (Democracy Development Diplomacy Defense) to publish what they call   research on Mr. Trump?s foreign investments. Their concern: that the president?s business dealings could clash with the nation?s national security interests. Their first targets: India and Turkey, with many more to come. White House aides have been trying to nudge the president to ditch his personal Twitter account and use the official @POTUS handle. After all, presidential communications are supposed to be archived and preserved under specific rules. Think Hillary Clinton?s private server, not something Mr. Trump appeared to approve of during the campaign. It?s not working. He started the day with: He continued with: (That one has the peculiarity of misstating the date of Mr. Trump?s inauguration.) And he has kept going. #MAGA! House and Senate Republicans decamp from Washington on Thursday for their annual retreat  ?   this time in Philadelphia. And House Speaker Paul D. Ryan made it official: President Trump will be the guest of honor. Despite a rocky start to their relationship, Walter M. Shaub Jr. the head of the Office of Government Ethics, is apparently still ?willing and ready? to help Mr. Trump handle his potential conflicts of interest. Mr. Shaub met with members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in a   session on Monday afternoon at the request of the chairman of the panel, Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah. After Mr. Shaub publicly criticized Mr. Trump?s plans this month, Mr. Chaffetz accused him of playing politics  ?   prompting Democrats and other watchdogs to come to the ethics monitor?s defense. According to a recap of Monday?s meeting by Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the committee, Mr. Shaub said that his office had not received copies of documents that Mr. Trump referenced at a news conference on Jan. 11, and that it had been provided with no new information. Still, Mr. Shaub said he would help the president, if called upon. There were about nine members of the committee at the meeting  ?   eight Democrats and Mr. Chaffetz, according to his spokeswoman, M. J. Henshaw. After Mr. Chaffetz left the meeting with Mr. Shaub, he told reporters: ?I think we understand each other better. ? Big Labor may have been With Her, but the unions that represent builders and pavers Love Him. ?We have a common bond with the president,? said Sean McGarvey, the president of North America?s Building Trades Unions, after meeting on Monday with Mr. Trump and hearing him promise a major push to rebuild the nation?s infrastructure. ?We come from the same industry. He understands the value of driving development, moving people to the middle class. ? If the labor movement divides over Mr. Trump, it would not be the first time. An old saying holds that the building trades would pave over their mothers? graves if it created jobs. And before Mr. Trump?s rise, unions like the Communications Workers of America and the Service Employees International Union had split with the building unions over the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines, with the former siding with liberal environmentalists and the latter seeing opportunities for work. In this case, the unions may unite with Democrats behind the new president  ?   leaving Republican spending hawks in the cold. On his first working day as the country?s new secretary of defense, James N. Mattis spoke with the head of NATO and told him that the United States depends on it and on Europe for   security. The telephone conversation came just a week after Mr. Mattis?s boss, Mr. Trump, called NATO ?obsolete,? because, Mr. Trump said, the alliance hasn?t done enough to combat terrorism. Mr. Mattis ?wanted to place the call on his first full day in office to reinforce the importance he places on the alliance,? a Pentagon spokesman, Capt. Jeff Davis, said in a statement on Monday night."
18397,Neil MacFarquhar and Ivan Nechepurenko,9/02/2017,2017,2,business,"MOSCOW  ?   A Russian court on Wednesday effectively derailed a presidential run by Aleksei A. Navalny  ?   the only opposition candidate with a broad, enthusiastic popular following  ?   by reviving a    criminal conviction. The decision by the district court was widely viewed as a move by President Vladimir V. Putin to eliminate his only viable rival in an election scheduled for March 2018. Although Mr. Putin has been coy about his decision to run for a fourth term, there is little question that he will. Some observers had speculated that the president would want a weighty opponent to lend legitimacy to his next victory. The best chance for a competitive race came to a screeching halt on Wednesday, however, when a district court in the small city of Kirov, nearly 500 miles northeast of Moscow, pronounced Mr. Navalny guilty of defrauding a state company. Russian law bars anyone with a criminal conviction from seeking elected office. Since he first came to power in January 2000, Mr. Putin and his allies have gone to great lengths to silence or undermine all critical voices in Russia. It has been almost two years since the   assassination of Boris Nemtsov, another charismatic opposition figure, on the doorstep of the Kremlin. His is the most recent in a string of killings of prominent critics  ?   politicians, journalists and human rights activists  ?   that remain unsolved. Russian television is largely back under government control, as it was during Soviet times, along with most formerly independent news agencies. More than 100 nongovernmental organizations working on issues including the environment, civic education and fighting the spread of AIDS have been declared ?foreign agents,? forcing many to close. Mr. Navalny was the driving force behind large street protests in 2011, 2012 and 2013 that unnerved Mr. Putin. He has also repeatedly embarrassed senior officials by accusing them of corruption, exposing their lavish mansions and other perquisites that seem beyond the reach of a public servant earning a modest government salary. In recent years, Mr. Navalny became the prime example of how the government would use the courts to entangle critics. In addition to the conviction revived on Wednesday, he has been accused of defrauding a French perfume company and stealing a nearly worthless piece of street art, and he was caught up in yet another case involving the death of an elk. While he spent much of 2014 under house arrest, his younger brother Oleg was sent to jail for three and a half years. Mr. Navalny, who called the Kirov fraud charges baseless and politically motivated, responded to the latest judgment against him with defiance. ?Putin and his gang of thieves are afraid to face us in elections,? he wrote on Twitter. ?Rightly so: We will win. ? In a longer statement, he vowed to continue his presidential run. ?We do not recognize this verdict. It will be overturned,? he said. ?According to the Constitution, I have a full right to take part in elections, and I will do this. I will continue to represent the interests of people who want to see Russia as a normal, honest, uncorrupt country. ? The Kirov court?s ruling followed almost verbatim the judgment issued against Mr. Navalny in the same case in 2013, which resulted in a   suspended sentence. That verdict was overturned by the European Court of Human Rights, and Russia?s Supreme Court ordered a new trial in December. Although the retrial was organized unusually quickly for Russia, Mr. Navalny announced that he was running for president before his latest conviction. Russian political analysts suggested that the prospect of Mr. Navalny?s gaining a national platform to further criticize Mr. Putin had proved too much for the Kremlin hierarchy to tolerate. ?The danger associated with Mr. Navalny is easy to explain,? Vladislav L. Inozemtsev, director of the Center for Postindustrial Studies in Moscow, wrote in an email. ?If allowed to run, he will disseminate his corruption findings more widely than ever  ?   and this disturbs very much Mr. Putin and his gang. ? Officials figured a predictable campaign against impotent opposition was a safer bet, analysts said. Some Kremlin insiders were concerned that letting Mr. Navalny run now would improve his standing for the presidential race in 2024, when Mr. Putin cannot run under current laws, analysts said. Mr. Navalny, 40, is a handsome, telegenic figure with a model family, much more approachable than the usually dour apparatchiks churned out by the Kremlin bureaucratic mill. Despite his earlier conviction, Mr. Navalny was allowed to run for mayor of Moscow in 2013. He garnered 27. 2 percent of the vote, just short of the threshold needed to force the   candidate into a runoff  ?   and enough to feed the Kremlin?s fears. Mr. Navalny?s spokeswoman, Kira Yarmysh, announced that he would appeal the verdict and file complaints with Russia?s Constitutional Court and the European Court of Human Rights. The European Union issued a statement criticizing the latest verdict, noting that its human rights court had already found that Mr. Navalny did not get a fair trial in 2013. ?This latest decision, which effectively excludes Mr. Navalny from the political arena, further constrains political pluralism in Russia and raises serious questions as to the fairness of democratic processes in Russia,? the statement said. Mr. Navalny and his team pointed out that there was a conflict between the electoral law and the Constitution, which does not list a criminal conviction among the specific reasons to bar a candidate. Legal analysts said that, just as in the fraud case, any rulings in the other cases against Mr. Navalny would undoubtedly favor the Kremlin. ?You can complain about this, but the result will be clear,? said Andrei Y. Buzin, an expert at Golos, an independent election monitor. ?The Constitutional Court will say that lawmakers have the right to impose the restrictions it deems necessary to protect the freedoms of other citizens. ? In the Kirov case, the court convicted Mr. Navalny of embezzling 16 million rubles, worth about $500, 000 at the time, by purchasing timber from a   company at   rates and then reselling it at market value. The investigators said Mr. Navalny had used his position at the time as an aide to the Kirov regional governor to persuade the company to sign the contract. Mr. Navalny said the timber was bought at market rates. As the judge, Aleksei Vtyurin, droned through the familiar decision in a barely audible monotone, reading from nearly the same verdict as four years ago, Mr. Navalny took to Twitter to mock the proceedings. ?This is page 40 now, and there are 77 of them. It?s comfortable to have the verdict in hand,? Mr. Navalny said from the courtroom. Even before the verdict was announced, the government moved to shut down the logistics for his presidential run. On Tuesday, Russia?s leading information technology company, Yandex, unplugged the online account that Mr. Navalny had used to collect money from supporters."
17942,Eduardo Porter,25/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"How could Mexico inflict the most damage on the United States? In normal times this question would not be top of mind for Mexican policy makers. Mexican governments over the last   have consistently pushed back against the nation?s historical resentment toward the United States, hoping to build a more cooperative relationship with its overbearing northern neighbor. But these aren?t normal times. As President Trump prepares the opening gambit in his project to either renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement or pull out, Mexico?s most important strategic goal is narrowing to one word: deterrence. It must convince Mr. Trump that if he blows up the trade agreement on which Mexico has staked its hopes of development, by weaving its economy ever more closely into that of the United States, the United States will suffer, too. The critical question is whether Mexico?s threat will be convincing. Mexico?s main challenge as it confronts a hostile Trump administration is the enormous asymmetry of the bilateral relationship. Ending Nafta would hurt the United States: Six million American jobs depend on exports to Mexico, according to Mexican officials. But to Mexico, it could prove devastating. Mexico has relied on the pact to draw foreign capital into the country, not only ensuring multinational companies stable access to the largest consumer market in the world but also guaranteeing that their investment is safe, noted Luis Rubio, who heads the Center of Research for Development in Mexico City. The makings of a Mexican strategy for defending its interests started coming into focus on Monday, when President Enrique Pe?a Nieto declared that negotiations for a future relationship with the United States would not be limited to trade. ?We will bring to the table all themes,? he said in a speech. ?Trade, yes, but also migration and the themes of security, including border security, terrorist threats and the traffic of illegal drugs, weapons and cash. ? His hope is that by introducing broader uncertainty about the bilateral relationship  ?   Will Mexico still cooperate in the fight against drug trafficking? Will it stop foreign terrorists from using Mexico as a way station into the United States?  ?   Mexico can raise the stakes enough for Mr. Trump to reconsider his ?America first? approach to commerce. ?Mexico has a lot of chips to play,? said Jorge Casta?eda, a former foreign secretary who has staked out a combative approach. Let Mr. Trump pull the United States out of Nafta, he argues. Instead of stopping Central American migrants at its southern border, Mexico should let them through on their way to the United States. ?And let?s see if his wall keeps the terrorists out, because we won?t,? Mr. Casta?eda added. The view from Mexico City is not uniformly bleak. Some analysts believe there is a potential for a situation in which a new Nafta benefits all. ?I have always believed one should never let a good crisis go to waste,? said Arturo Sarukhÿn, a former Mexican ambassador to the United States. ?There is an opportunity that we could end up modernizing and improving Nafta. ? The view that there is a potential silver lining to Mr. Trump?s hostility toward Nafta is also popular in some Washington circles. The    agreement is due for some modernization anyway, if only to deal with things like data protection, online crime and    ?   which were not around in the early 1990s. Nafta?s weak provisions on labor and environmental standards could also be improved. Many aspects of Nafta could be upgraded, trade experts say. It could do with new rules to open up government projects to bidders from all three Nafta partners. Allowing   trucking companies from Mexico and the United States into each other?s markets could make trade between the two more efficient. What?s more, the   border could benefit from more infrastructure investments to integrate energy networks, reduce clogged lines at border crossings and the like. Now that Mr. Trump has formally nixed the   Partnership, which would have tied North America and nine other nations from the Pacific Rim into one large trade bloc, some of its provisions could be drafted into a new North American deal. Gary Hufbauer of the   Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington suggests that the name ?Nafta? be retired  ?   it has a bad reputation. But a lot of its substance could remain, perhaps in the form of separate bilateral agreements with Canada and Mexico. ?Trump wants some easy victories,? Mr. Hufbauer pointed out. If he can score political points using his Twitter feed to persuade a few companies to keep jobs in the United States, why risk hurting the American economy by abandoning the North American trade deal? ?Maybe that?s the reconciliation,? Mr. Hufbauer said. Still, it?s hard to reconcile the proposal for an improved, more effective trading pact in North America with Mr. Trump?s frequent portrayal of trade as a   game that inevitably shortchanges the United States. In Mr. Trump?s eyes, improving Nafta seems to mean eliminating Mexico?s trade surplus with the United States and limiting investment by American multinationals in Mexico. But one can?t quickly eliminate a $60 billion trade surplus with a new Nafta  ?   not unless it has some incredibly draconian limits on imports or local content requirements that could be as damaging to Mexico as abandoning the pact altogether. Many Mexican officials fear that it is precisely this kind of draconian change that Mr. Trump has in mind. It would be politically profitable, at least in the short term. And it would signal toughness to China  ?   a more formidable rival that is next on Mr. Trump?s list. If Canada stays out of the fray, cutting a separate deal with the United States to replace Nafta, Mexico would be left alone in an existential fight for its future. In this case, Mexico may have no choice but to raise the stakes and hope to arrive at the negotiating table with a threat at least as credible as Mr. Trump?s promise to pull out of the deal. Mr. Trump?s negotiating position does have some soft spots. For one, said Mickey Kantor, the American trade negotiator who concluded the Nafta negotiations during the Clinton administration, ?he is under pressure to deliver a deal. ? If Mexico stands its ground and even allows Nafta to dissolve, it would send its own signal to China: Resistance is not futile. And Mr. Trump?s threat to raise tariffs against Mexico to 35 percent could easily be challenged under the rules of the World Trade Organization. This is, of course, a hugely risky strategy for Mexico. When Mr. Trump entered the presidential race in June 2015, a dollar was worth about 15 pesos. Now it?s worth about 22. A frontal confrontation with the United States might send it to 40, Mexican officials fear, fueling capital flight. And yet that may be Mexico?s strongest card. As noted by C. Fred Bergsten, director emeritus of the Peterson Institute, an irony of Mr. Trump?s approach to Mexico is that by weakening the peso so much, he is going to increase the bilateral trade deficit, increase Mexico?s competitiveness and make it more attractive for American companies to invest there. ?That is going to swamp anything he achieves with his    efforts,? he added. That?s if Mexico manages to hold on. The more ominous situation is one in which the United States pushes too hard and Mexico  ?   its economy, its unpopular government, its public order and political stability  ?   buckles. The United States has enjoyed a peaceful southern border for 100 years, since Pancho Villa made his marauding raids into the Southwest during the Mexican Revolution. ?That is worth pure gold in this and any other world,? Mr. Casta?eda said. ?Mexico?s best argument is ?Don?t mess with that. ??"
18355,Emily Palmer,7/02/2017,2017,2,business,"Driving down a tight mountain road in Jarabacoa, a town in the middle of the Dominican Republic, Oscar Pedro Duran Abreu saw the oncoming Jeep weaving in the other lane before it hit him. He remembers trying to swerve. He remembers the Jeep slamming into his side door, pushing his car into the safety blocks on the side of the road, saving him from a steep fall down the mountainside. ?And I don?t remember anything else,? he said of that day in September 2010. Mr. Duran learned later that the other driver had been drunk and that his Jeep had flipped. The four passengers in the Jeep were injured, but the driver, unharmed, pushed his way out of the vehicle and fled. ?Leaving me for dead,? Mr. Duran said. Unconscious, Mr. Duran was taken to a nearby hospital, where he was in a coma for 29 days. Six years later, seated at a table with his children, Jose and Karina Duran, and speaking through an interpreter, Mr. Duran leaned back in a chair at his son?s school and recalled emerging from the coma with his jaw wired shut. He looked around and thought, ?What happened?? The accident left him with injuries to his neck, spinal cord and knee, as well as a broken jaw, extensive memory loss and nerve damage causing numbness in his face. The crash also knocked out eight teeth, which he has not been able to afford to replace. He spent the next 92 days on bed rest. Doctors placed metal plates in his neck and left knee, but he is still unable to bend the knee or kneel and has trouble walking. ?Since the accident, my closest friend has been pain,? he said. The sixth of 11 children, Mr. Duran grew up on a farm in Jarabacoa, where his family grew yucca and sweet potatoes, among other crops, until he was 18. With only a   education, he left for Santo Domingo, the capital, working as a shoe shiner and a waiter, and held various jobs in a supermarket, a casino and a hospital. He later began a   career in the national police force, working as a homicide investigator in Jarabacoa until his accident. But his extensive injuries kept him from returning to the national police. Then, in 2012, the   relationship with the mother of his children fell apart. She took the children to live with her, but Mr. Duran eventually had them come live with him. To get them out of the Dominican Republic, his mother, a permanent resident of the United States who often stayed with her children in New York, referred him for a residential visa. He joined the family in New York in July 2013, fulfilling his mother?s wish to have all of her children together in the United States. She returned to the Dominican Republic after settling him in America, and died six months later. Unable to work because of his injuries, Mr. Duran struggled to find his way in a new country. He lived with siblings in Brooklyn for a year but was unable to contribute to the family?s income. So in spring 2014, he found himself homeless with his children in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. ?It was cold,? Jose, now 12, recalled of the two nights they spent sleeping on a park bench. Mr. Duran added: ?Life has kicked me down. But I have to go forward  ?   for them. ? He smiled at his children, who sat quietly on each side of him. Mr. Duran found them a studio at a city shelter on East 178th Street in the Bronx. His request for two rooms  ?   one for his daughter, 10, for privacy  ?   was later granted. The family does not pay rent, but with Mr. Duran unable to work, it struggles to make ends meet. In March 2016, Mr. Duran briefly worked as a cabdriver. However, the car payments and maintenance, coupled with the pain from his knee injury, soon became too much, and he quit the service. Now the family receives $205 a month in food stamps. Jose, a seventh grader at C. S. 211, a bilingual magnet school in the Bronx, is working to become fluent in English. His sister is already fluent. The   program is run by the Children?s Aid Society, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. In April,   program staff members noticed that Jose was wearing the same   clothes every day. The Children?s Aid Society provided the family with $375 in gift cards to Payless, Old Navy and Modell?s Sporting Goods to buy new school clothes and shoes for the children. Despite the family?s struggles, Mr. Duran said he did not let poverty bother him. He spoke reverently of his father, Pedro Lucia Duran, a forest ranger and village confidant, whom he called ?a simple man, an honorable man. ? He added: ?There?s no man like my father. He raised 11 children to be serious and honest, and he did it as a poor man. ? For that reason, he also does not seek out riches. ?My father always said, ?In America, the president eats lobster,?? he recalled with a laugh. ??But in the Dominican Republic, the poor eat lobster. ?? Mr. Duran said he wanted only to raise his own children in the same manner as his father. While in the United States, he hopes his children can work toward their own dreams. Karina, a fifth grader, enjoys painting and drawing and would like to become a pop star, she said with a shy smile. Jose  ?   who ?really can draw,? according to his sister  ?   is fascinated by space, but has no interest in becoming an astronaut. He wants to build the spaceships instead. ?And my American dream?? Mr. Duran said. ?My dream is that if I die today, my children will be able to do what they want and to remain humble and polite. ? As for Mr. Duran, 52, he worries that he is a burden on a social assistance system that, after a career in the Dominican Republic, he is unable to contribute to here. He would like to return to his country one day, he said, adding that he was happy there. But he fears that politics, drugs and guns have broken an otherwise beautiful nation. ?America is the best there is,? he said. ?I?m thankful to this country for taking me and my children in. But despite all these problems in my country, if I could, I?d still go back. ?"
17286,William McDonald,10/04/2017,2017,4,entertainment,"Death may be the great equalizer, but it isn?t necessarily evenhanded. Of all the fields of endeavor that suffered mortal losses in 2016  ?   consider Muhammad Ali and Arnold Palmer in sports and the      Hollywood deaths of Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds  ?   the pop music world had, hands down, the bleakest year. Start with David Bowie, whose stage persona  ?   androgynous glam rocker, dance pop star, electronic experimentalist  ?   was as   as his music. The year was only days old when the news came that he had died of cancer at 69. He had hinted that his time was short in the lyrics of his final album, released just two days before his death, but he had otherwise gone to great lengths to hide his illness from the public, a wish for privacy that ensured that his death would appear to have come out of the blue. Then came another shock, about three months later, when Prince accidentally overdosed on a painkiller and collapsed in an elevator at his sprawling home studio near Minneapolis. Death came to him at 57, and by all indications no one, including Prince Rogers Nelson, had seen it coming. As energetic onstage as ever, holding to an otherwise healthy regimen, he had successfully defied age into his sixth decade, so why not death, too? Leonard Cohen, on the other hand, in his 83rd year, undoubtedly did see it coming, just over his shoulder, but he went on his  ?   I hesitate to say merry  ?   way, ever the wise,   troubadour playing to sellout crowds and shrugging at the inevitable, knowing that the dark would finally overtake him but saying essentially, ?Until then, here?s another song. ? It was as if 2016 hadn?t delivered enough jolts to the system when it closed out the year with yet another   death. George Michael, the 1980s sensation whose aura had dimmed in later years, was 53 when he went to bed and never woke up on Christmas. Pop music figures fell all year, many of their voices still embedded in the nicked vinyl grooves of old records that a lot of people can?t bear to throw out. The roster included Paul Kantner of Jefferson Airplane Keith Emerson and Greg Lake of Emerson, Lake and Palmer Glenn Frey of the Eagles and Maurice White of Earth, Wind  Fire. Leon Russell, the piano pounder with a Delta blues wail and a mountain man?s mass of hair, died. So did Merle Haggard, rugged country poet of the common man and the   outlaw. He was joined by the bluegrass legend Ralph Stanley and the guitar virtuoso who was practically glued to Elvis?s swiveling hips in the early days: Scotty Moore. And then there was George Martin, whose   genius had such a creative influence on the sounds of John, Paul, George and Ringo (and, by extension, on the entire rock era) that he was hailed as the fifth Beatle. If the music stars could fill arenas, so could idols of another stripe: the mighty athletes who left the scene. No figure among them was as towering as Ali. Some called him the greatest sports figure of the 20th century, the boxer who combined power, grace and brains in a way the ring had never seen. But he was more than a great athlete. Matters of war, race and religion coursed through his life in a publicly turbulent way. Some people hated him when he refused to be drafted during the Vietnam War, a decision that cost him his heavyweight title. But more people admired him, even loved him, for his principled stands, his high spirits, his lightning mind, his winking   and, yes, his rhyming motormouth. Until illness closed in, little could contain him, certainly not mere ropes around a ring. Palmer, too, was transformational, golf?s first media star. The gentleman?s game was never quite the same after he began gathering an army on the rolling greenswards and leading a charge, his shirt coming untucked, a cigarette dangling from his lips, his club just that, a weapon, as he pressed the attack. An entire generation of   postwar guys took up the game because of Arnie, and not a few women did, too. He was athletically blessed, magnetically cool, telegenically handsome  ?   but he was somehow one of them, too. The same was said of Gordie Howe, Mr. Hockey, a son of the Saskatchewan prairie who tore up the National Hockey League, hung up his skates at 52 and died at 88 and of Ralph Branca, a trolley car conductor?s son who was a living reminder that one crushing mistake  ?   his, the fastball to Bobby Thomson that decided the 1951 National League pennant  ?   can sometimes never be lived down. Pat Summitt, the coach who elevated women?s basketball, led her Tennessee teams to eight championships and won more games than any other college coach, could not defeat Alzheimer?s disease, dying at 64. And within months the National Basketball Association lost two giants from different eras. Clyde Lovelette, an Olympic, college and N. B. A. champion who transformed the game as one of its first truly big men, was 86 his hardwood heir Nate Thurmond, a defensive stalwart who battled Russell, Wilt and Kareem in the paint in a   Hall of Fame career, was 74. Even older, in the baseball ranks, was Monte Irvin. When he died at 96, there were few people still around who could remember watching him play, particularly in his prime, in the 1940s, when he was a star on the Negro circuit but barred from the   major leagues. He made the Hall of Fame anyway as a New York Giant and became Major League Baseball?s first black executive, but when he died, fans pondered again the question that has hung over many an athletic career shackled by discrimination: What if? A different question, in an entirely different sphere, arose after the stunning news that Justice Antonin Scalia had died on a hunting trip in Texas: What now? In the thick of one of the most consequential Supreme Court careers of modern times, he left a void in conservative jurisprudence and, more urgently, a vacancy on the bench that has yet to be filled, raising still more questions about what may await the country. Other exits from the public stage returned us to the past. Nancy Reagan?s death evoked the 1980s White House, where   glamour and   West Coast conservatism took up residence on the banks of the Potomac. John Glenn?s had us thinking again about a   burst of national pride soaring into outer space. The deaths of Tom Hayden and Daniel Berrigan, avatars of defiance, harked back to the student rebellions of the 1960s and the Vietnam War?s roiling home front. Phyllis Schlafly?s obituaries were windows on the roots of the right wing?s ascension in American politics. The death of Janet Reno, the first woman to serve as attorney general, recalled the Clinton years, all eight of them, from the firestorm at Waco, Tex. to the international tug of war over a Cuban boy named Eliÿn Gonzÿlez, to the bitter Senate battle over impeachment. On other shores, Fidel Castro?s death at 90 summoned memories of Cuban revolution, nuclear brinkmanship and enduring enmity between a   strongman and the superpower only 90 miles away. The name of Boutros   the Egyptian diplomat who led the United Nations, led to replayed nightmares of genocide in Rwanda and Bosnia. The death of Shimon Peres removed a last link to the very founding of Israel and conjured decades of growing military power and fitful strivings for peace. And that of Elie Wiesel, in New York, after his tireless struggle to compel the world never to forget, made us confront once again the gas chambers of Auschwitz. If writers, too, are   even in fiction, then the world is poorer without the literary voices of Harper Lee, Umberto Eco, Pat Conroy, Jim Harrison, Anita Brookner, Alvin Toffler, Gloria Naylor and William Trevor, not to mention the playwrights Peter Shaffer, Dario Fo and,   Edward Albee  ?   all dead in 2016. But just as treasured were those who spun   for our viewing pleasure  ?   none more lustily than Ms. Fisher, the     Princess Leia of the ?Star Wars? tales. Just a day later, capping a year of startling deaths, Ms. Reynolds, a singing and acting leading lady of an earlier era, died at 84 in the throes of a mother?s grief. Devotees of the ?Harry Potter? movies were saddened by the death of Alan Rickman, who played the deliciously dour professor Severus Snape in that blockbuster franchise but whose career, on both stage and screen, was far richer than many of Snape?s younger fans may have known. Zsa Zsa Gabor?s celebrity, by contrast, outshone a modest acting career. Gene Wilder and Garry Shandling died in the same year, both having perfected a brand of hilariously neurotic comedy fit for a   culture. And this time Abe Vigoda, of the ?Godfather? movies and ?Barney Miller,? actually did die, after having not actually done so years ago when wildly uninformed people spread the word that he had. On the other side of the camera were directors whose vision came to us from all parts: Jacques Rivette, the French New Wave auteur, with his   meditations on life and art Abbas Kiarostami, the Iranian master, with his searching examinations of ordinary lives Andrzej Wajda, a rival to Ingmar Bergman and Akira Kurosawa in some critics? eyes, with his haunting tales of Poland under the boot first of Nazis and then of Communists. A long roster of television stars of a generation or two ago passed on, images of their younger selves frozen in time: Noel Neill (?Adventures of Superman?) Alan Young (?Mister Ed?) Robert Vaughn (?The Man From U. N. C. L. E. ?) William Schallert and Patty Duke (father and daughter on ?The Patty Duke Show?) Dan Haggerty (?The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams?) Florence Henderson (?The Brady Bunch?) and Alan Thicke (?Growing Pains?). And Garry Marshall, the creative force who practically owned prime time with ?Happy Days,? ?Mork  Mindy,? ?Laverne  Shirley? and more, died at 81. On Broadway, lights were dimmed in memory of Brian Bedford, Tammy Grimes and Anne Jackson, all brilliant in their day. The architect Zaha Hadid left behind monuments to her fertile imagination and shaken acolytes around the world. The street photographer Bill Cunningham, who found fashion statements on every corner, was suddenly missing, making Manhattan, overnight, a less idiosyncratic, less interesting place. That smiling skinny man pedaling his bicycle among the honking cabs in a blue French worker?s jacket with a camera slung around his neck  ?   what a picture!  ?   had split from the scene. So had seemingly a generation of fellow photographers who had made art in recording the last half of the 20th century: Ruth Gruber, Marc Riboud, Louis Stettner and more. And so had the TV journalists Morley Safer and Gwen Ifill and the TV commentator John McLaughlin, all of whom had tried to make sense of it. Music?s other precincts were emptier without the conductor and revolutionary composer Pierre Boulez and the new music soprano Phyllis Curtin the jazz artists Mose Allison, Bobby Hutcherson and Gato Barbieri the rapper Phife Dawg (Malik Taylor) and the Latin megastar Juan Gabriel. Silicon Valley saw a giant depart in Andrew S. Grove, who led the semiconductor revolution at Intel. The television industry lost a   executive, Grant Tinker, who in the ?80s made NBC the network to watch in prime time. Astrophysics, and the smaller world of women in science, said farewell to a pioneer and a champion in Vera Rubin. And for tens of thousands of people who might have choked to death had they not been saved by his simple but ingenious maneuver, the passing of Henry J. Heimlich prompted not just sympathy but, even more, gratitude. Come to think of it, eliciting a large, if silent, thank you from those who live on is not a bad way for anyone to go. Which brings us to Marion Pritchard. Few who died in 2016 could have inspired measures of gratitude more profound. She was a brave young Dutch student and a   gentile who risked her life to save Jews from death camps in the early 1940s, in one instance shooting a Nazi stooge before he could seize three little children she had been hiding. By her estimate she saved 150 people. How many were still alive when she died a few weeks ago at 96 is anyone?s guess. But we know for certain that some were, and we can reasonably surmise that a good many more were, too, all of them still in possession of her selfless gift and her matchless legacy, their very lives."

17846,Brian X. Chen,12/01/2017,2017,1,technology,"IN my spare time, when not writing about consumer technology for The New York Times, I have a sideline renting out a cabin on Airbnb. So when Jose reserved the property last October, it was nothing unusual. He said he wanted to host some relatives for a quiet weekend in the mountains. I welcomed him without hesitation. That Saturday, my neighbors texted me as they watched caterers carry large white pillars and bouquets into the backyard. Then 10 cars surrounded the front yard and dozens of people wearing suits and dresses poured into the house. It became clear this was no intimate  . For a day, my Airbnb rental was turned into a wedding venue, which broke city laws. My business would be in jeopardy if the police were notified. Such is life as an Airbnb ?Superhost. ? Since buying my cabin in Northern California in late 2015, I have hosted about 30 groups and become part of the booming ecosystem for Airbnb, the online reservation marketplace that lets people turn their homes into vacation rentals. With more than 140 million guest arrivals to date, Airbnb has proved a boon for hosts and an attractive option for travelers looking to avoid hefty fees from hotels. In the process, I have been named a Superhost, which means I have hosted many guests and consistently received   reviews. It?s a small group  ?   researchers say only about 7 percent of hosts are Superhosts. In exchange, I get more visibility in search results, invitations from the company to exclusive events and a medal next to my profile photo. The designation as a Superhost has paid off: My house is a few bookings away from netting a profit. Yet vaulting to Superhost status is hardly intuitive, and I learned hard lessons along the way. Here are some tips on running a successful (and lucrative) Airbnb rental based on interviews with Superhosts and my experience. People who rent your house on Airbnb are choosing it over a hotel. So you had better be as hospitable, friendly and communicative as a hotel. For your rental, that means a few things. Provide staples like cooking equipment, cable TV, soap for bathing and cleaning, towels, toothpaste and toilet paper. Your house should work as advertised  ?   faulty appliances should be repaired or replaced. For another, be extremely responsive to guests, much like a hotel front desk. Nobody trusts a host who is slow to respond. Jasper Ribbers, a   of ?Get Paid for Your Pad,? a book about his experience as an Airbnb Superhost who has completed more than 300 stays, uses the app AvivaIQ to respond automatically to messages from potential guests, which comes in handy when he is asleep. When he is awake, he can continue the conversation. Being dishonest about your listing will hurt when it comes time for a guest to leave a review. It?s better to be straightforward about what you are offering and transparent about any imperfections. In my experience, guests were surprised in the summer that the house lacked   even though the listing never said it had  . I resolved this with subsequent guests by saying explicitly in my welcome email that the house lacked   and that portable fans were in each room. Be quick to address complaints, or risk facing a negative review. If a dishwasher breaks or the shower pressure is too low, send a plumber. If a remote control was misplaced or stolen by a previous group, have a backup remote ready in a drawer. If you host the property remotely, the best option is to befriend someone trustworthy in the neighborhood who can act as a property manager. Pay the manager a fee for each task. Airbnb attracts travelers from all over the world, and it is remarkable how standards for cleanliness differ from person to person. My jaw dropped when one guest left a positive review about her stay, but dropped me one star because the   brush was dirty. (Couldn?t she have used the clean sponge instead?) There is no point acting defensive. The solution is to hire superb professional cleaners. Relay any negative feedback from guests to your cleaners so they improve over time. Depending on where your house is, demand may be higher at certain times of year. If you hope to ever make a profit, you will want to set prices higher during peak rental seasons, and reduce prices during slow seasons. But constantly changing prices on your listing can be daunting. I use a dynamic pricing tool, BeyondPricing. com, that automatically adjusts prices based on demand, including factors like holidays, peak travel season and the day of the week. (Airbnb provides its own dynamic pricing tool called Smart Pricing, but in my experience it chooses rates that are too low.) Last year, Airbnb introduced an   policy that urged hosts to welcome guests regardless of race, religion, sexual orientation, gender and age. That makes sense, since Airbnb wants to connect hosts with travelers from all over the world. But it doesn?t mean you should let just anybody into your home. Hosts reserve the right to decide what types of groups they would like to host, especially when taking into consideration city laws. For my rental, city law forbids loud parties past 10 p. m. When guests request the house, I ask them the purpose of the visit and ask them to carefully read and agree to my house rules, including one about loud noise. I am less inclined to book a group of college students looking to have a party than I am to book a family planning a winter vacation. (Though if the students promised to stay quiet, I would probably book them.) Mr. Ribbers, the Airbnb Superhost, said he preferred families or couples staying in his   apartment in Amsterdam partly because of the size constraints. He also typically accepts bookings only from guests who already have positive reviews themselves. When guests reserve his home, he reads their profiles to get a sense of their personalities and check if they have verified their identities with Airbnb by providing driver?s license information, among other documentation. Some vetting is permitted by Airbnb?s nondiscrimination policy, which says hosts can decline to rent based on factors that are not prohibited by law  ?   so my rejection of those planning to have loud parties fits the bill. Another important point is to describe your listing depending on the guests you want. Mr. Ribbers titled his listing ?Couples Getaway. ? My listing, intended to attract family ski trips, advertises the house?s proximity to the ski lifts. Most guests are not bad people. But perhaps one out of 10 times, a rotten egg will pass your smell test. The lesson I learned from Jose was that being a Superhost did not make me impervious to the actions of a misbehaving guest. To protect yourself, diligently document everything valuable in your house. Take photos of countertops, the refrigerator, stove, dining table, barbecue grill and television set. In the event anything is damaged, Airbnb will ask for    photos to prove that guests caused the damage. With Jose, after an Airbnb representative evicted the group for breaking my house rules, I found a large chip in my kitchen countertop. After sending Airbnb the photo of the damaged countertop, a company representative concluded it was not reasonable to let me keep Jose?s security deposit because ?there is no way to document whether or not the chip on the counter was there before or after this guest stayed at the listing. ? Airbnb did agree to charge Jose for excess guests  ?   but only for those my neighbors were able to photograph. Nick Shapiro, an Airbnb spokesman, said I should have been treated better and the company apologized that its resolution process ?did not work as it was supposed to in this incident. ? In my conversations with Jose, he insisted that he did nothing wrong and that I broke the contract by kicking his group out of the house. Neither of us could leave each other a review because his reservation was voided."
18438,Brooks Barnes,10/02/2017,2017,2,entertainment,"LOS ANGELES  ?   Because he was told that   were box office poison, and he wrote the screenplay for ?Hell or High Water? anyway, resulting in one of the few Hollywood films of 2016 to shine a light on   America. Because, as a former actor, he creates vivid characters that are fun to perform. Because he was overlooked by Oscar voters for his last script, the   drug thriller ?Sicario. ? Could voting members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences talk themselves into giving Taylor Sheridan the trophy for best original screenplay? With a week and a half to go before ballots are due, the annual Oscar race has officially entered the stage when voters can grow bored with the sure bets  ?   repeated for months by prognostication outfits like GoldDerby. com  ?   and look for smaller ways to reward films that have little chance of winning bigger prizes. Fitting that bill this time may be Mr. Sheridan, a nominee for ?Hell or High Water. ? The   Mr. Sheridan, 47, who quit his journeyman acting career in 2011 and moved to Wyoming, is not the   in his category. Better positioned are the establishment favorite Kenneth Lonergan, who wrote ?Manchester by the Sea? and has been nominated by the academy for his writing twice before and Damien Chazelle, the prodigy behind ?La La Land? who took home the writing prize at the Golden Globes. [See where to stream ?Hell or High Water.] But Mr. Lonergan and Mr. Chazelle are vulnerable. Some voters find Mr. Lonergan?s script overlong. ?Manchester by the Sea? is also likely to be honored in other categories, including best actor, where Casey Affleck is a favorite. As for Mr. Chazelle, his screenplay has been overshadowed by his ?La La Land? directing (collecting the top prize at the bellwether Directors Guild of America Awards) and the strong likelihood that ?La La Land? will win best picture. ?Hell or High Water,? a meditation on failure disguised as a    chase movie, has its own disadvantages. It was released by CBS Films and Lionsgate in August, outside the traditional awards corridor. Some dislike its ambiguous ending. And it took in only $27 million at the box office  ?   a feat for an art film that cost a lean $12 million to make, but a niche sum all the same. (The final two films vying for the original screenplay Oscar have taken in even less. ?The Lobster,? a dystopian story dreamed up by Yorgos Lanthimos and Efthymis Filippou, collected $9. 1 million. Written by Mike Mills, ?20th Century Women? has managed $5 million.) But Mr. Sheridan has a shot, partly because giving him a little gold man is a way for voters to sneak some love to the film. Directed by David Mackenzie and starring Jeff Bridges as a twangy Texas marshal, ?Hell or High Water? is nominated for best picture but won?t win. Sure, Mr. Bridges could triumph in the supporting actor contest. But Mahershala Ali seems to have that one in the bag for his tender portrayal of a drug dealer in ?Moonlight?  ?   especially after that emotional speech he gave at the Screen Actors Guild Awards. That leaves Mr. Sheridan. On Monday at the annual Oscar nominee luncheon in Beverly Hills, Mr. Sheridan said that he was still struggling to comprehend his nomination. A win? ?You feel so presumptuous to even think about it,? he said quietly. He was wearing a dark suit, but he would probably have been more comfortable in a pair of   cowboy boots. Rather than flying to Los Angeles, he drove from Wyoming  ?   a   trip  ?   in his   ?dually? truck. (For you city slickers, that means it has a set of double tires in the back.) ?Hell or High Water? is the story of brothers  ?   one younger (Chris Pine) with ?a kind face marked by years of sun and disappointment,? as Mr. Sheridan described the character in his script, and one older (Ben Foster) with ?an air of danger that attracts as many women as it repels. ? They rob West Texas banks in the throes of the Great Recession to pay back predatory bank loans and save the family homestead. A casually racist lawman (Mr. Bridges) and his part Comanche, part Hispanic deputy (Gil Birmingham) investigate, passing through one dying town after another and meeting various characters, including one of the orneriest waitresses ever put on film. (?That weren?t a question,? she snaps, taking their   steak lunch order.) Mr. Sheridan wrote ?Hell or High Water? in less than three weeks. ?I don?t outline,? he said. ?I sit down to write and I take the ride. If something starts to not feel right, I go back to the last place that felt like jazz to me. ? He wrote what he knew. Mr. Sheridan grew up on a ranch near Cranfills Gap, Tex. population 277. It was a spare existence: His family had no stereo, he said, but they did have Bess, a yellow station wagon with an   player. His parents sometimes sat in the car with a   of beer and listened to Waylon Jennings. The Sheridans lost their property in the   economic downturn. ?Otherwise I would still be living there,? Mr. Sheridan said. Instead, he wound up in Austin after flunking out of Texas State University. One day he was approached by a Hollywood talent scout who offered to fly him to Los Angeles. ?I figured I might as well take the free trip,? he recalled. To his surprise, Mr. Sheridan began booking small roles on series like ?Walker, Texas Ranger. ? By 2011 he had landed a regular part on ?Sons of Anarchy,? but he was still struggling to support his family. Conceding that his acting career had peaked, he sat down in his cramped Hollywood apartment and started writing ?Sicario,? a dark, morally ambiguous   drama with shifting protagonists. ?I had read enough scripts to know what not to do,? he said. ?Sicario? rode strong reviews to $85 million in worldwide ticket sales. (A sequel, ?Soldado,? may arrive later this year, as may ?Wind River,? a thriller about a manhunt on an Indian reservation that Mr. Sheridan wrote and directed.) ?Hell or High Water,? Mr. Sheridan?s second script, was equally daring. ?A film about rural disenfranchisement and the way that institutions have abandoned people, with a major character in his 60s who spits out racist barbs  ?   I never thought it would sell, so I just did exactly what I wanted to do,? Mr. Sheridan said. The film?s racial banter was particularly concerning to the film?s eventual backers. ?There was hesitation about that and rightly so,? he said. ?But it?s something that exists. That?s how a lot of these guys talk. ? Mr. Sheridan continued: ?I think that kind of casual racism comes from insecurity  ?   guys who don?t know how to express their affection with each other so they revert to these insults. They think it?s playful. But their words create a divide. ? He paused for a moment, before channeling his inner ornery waitress. ?I didn?t want to   these people,? he said gruffly. ?I wanted to be really honest  ?   take ?em or leave ?em  ?   and I think that?s one reason the film has connected. ?"
17418,Mike McPhate,6/01/2017,2017,1,law,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here?s the  .) Let?s turn it over to Jonah Engel Bromwich for today?s introduction. A California law that went into effect on Sunday barring drivers from holding phones while operating vehicles is among the most stringent in the nation. But experts say that it most likely won?t be enough to prevent accidents caused by distracted driving. Jennifer Ryan, AAA?s director of state relations, cautioned in a phone interview on Thursday that, ?hands free is not risk free. ? Ms. Ryan said the California measure matched a larger trend of states bringing legislation    with contemporary phones. But while the state?s provisions were particularly broad, she said, it was important for motorists to take responsibility for themselves and pay attention. The law goes beyond what federal authorities recommend to prevent distracted driving, which remains a significant cause of traffic fatalities. The latest statistics from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration show that more than 3, 400 people died in 2015 in crashes that involved a distracted driver. Of those, 272 were teenagers. And while the use of smartphones is certainly part of the problem, many are unconvinced that keeping them out of drivers? hands will be a panacea. Some have speculated that the California law may encourage enthusiasm for   cars. When Gov. Jerry Brown signed the measure into law in September, he approved of another bill that allowed for the first tests of autonomous driving vehicles on public roads. Steve Finnegan, the government affairs manager of the Automobile Club of Southern California, said that while the new legislation ?is a step in the right direction,? it does not address ?the complete issue of distracted driving. ? ?One of the bigger issues is cognitive distraction,? Mr. Finnegan said. ?It?s not what your hands are doing it?s what your brain is doing. ? (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have metered paywalls.) ?

Sausalito, a tiny waterfront community just north of the Golden Gate Bridge, is an inspiring place. So it was, many summers ago, that Otis Redding stayed on a houseboat there and came up with the first idea for an American classic. It was this weekend in 1968 that Mr. Redding?s ?(Sittin? on) the Dock of the Bay? was released. In August 1967, the   soul singer had come to San Francisco to do a series of gigs at Basin Street West, a storied club at the time. According to Jonathan Gould, the author of a forthcoming biography of Mr. Redding, the rock promoter Bill Graham offered Mr. Redding the use of his houseboat up in Sausalito. While relaxing there with his guitar, he is thought to have sketched the lines: Later, the guitarist Steve Cropper helped to fill out the rest of the song and it was recorded in November. But Mr. Redding never heard the single. Just 18 days after the studio session, he died in a plane crash in Madison, Wis. on Dec. 10, 1967. He was 26. On Jan. 8, 1968, the ?Dock of the Bay? album was released. The single rose to No. 1 on Billboard?s pop chart and stayed there for four weeks. It was the biggest hit of Mr. Redding?s career.

18370,Peter Kujawinski,12/02/2017,2017,2,lifestyle,"Thousands of years ago, every lake was like Great Bear Lake. So pure you could lower a cup into the water and drink it. So beautiful that people composed love songs to it. So mysterious that many believed it was alive. Today, of the 10 largest lakes in the world, it is the last one that remains essentially primeval. Great Bear Lake straddles the Arctic Circle in the remote Northwest Territories of Canada. At just over 12, 000 square miles, the lake is the eighth largest in the world. It is bigger than Belgium and deeper than Lake Superior, and it is covered in ice and snow most of the year. The surrounding area is wilderness too  ?   a sprawling land of untouched boreal forest and tundra, rivers and mountains. The only human settlement on its shores is the town of Deline, population 503. This isolated community is mostly Sahtuto?ine, meaning the Bear Lake People. They are as connected to the lake as the name implies, and for practical, cultural, historic and even prophetic reasons, they are determined to keep it pristine. Their efforts paid off in 2016. In March, the Great Bear Lake watershed was declared a Unesco Biosphere Reserve. Called the Tsÿ Tu? Biosphere Reserve, it is the largest in North America, and the first in the world to be led by an indigenous community. Several months later, the Canadian government granted Deline   ensuring local control in areas like language and education. It is the first time that an aboriginal government in Canada will represent everyone in the community, aboriginal and nonaboriginal alike. Taken together, the Unesco and   announcements reinforce Deline?s ability to control what happens to Great Bear Lake. David Livingstone, now retired after decades of working on environmental issues for the Canadian government in the far north, helped Deline apply for Unesco designation. To the Sahtuto?ine, Great Bear Lake is ?not just a body of water it?s fundamental to their culture,? he said. ?The folks in Deline consider the lake to be a living thing. ? Great Bear Lake is important to Mr. Livingstone as well. ?It is the last great lake of its size and quality on the planet,? he said. ?It?s like the Mona Lisa  ?   a world treasure. ? I had spent an hour or two in Deline back in 2014, as an American diplomat posted to Canada. It was July and the lake was   endless and flat to the horizon. During my   tour, it was the sole time I needed a translator, because many Deline elders speak only their own language, North Slavey. This past November, I returned to Deline to learn more about the community?s relationship with the lake, to witness the interplay of culture, language, wilderness and isolation that makes this area so distinct. It was late afternoon when the small plane dipped through a thick,   cloud layer and I saw boreal forest  ?   part of a vast biome that stretches across northern North America and Eurasia  ?   as far as the eye could see. The plane descended toward a slender strip covered in white, Deline?s single runway. It was a short drive from the airport to the hotel where I was staying, the   Grey Goose Lodge. For such a tiny community, Deline has more tourist infrastructure than I expected, including a small handicrafts store in the hotel and an ambition to welcome the growing number of tourists who travel to Canada?s north for a winter and wilderness experience. The evening I arrived, I met with Morris Neyelle, a member of the new governing council, the K?aowedo Ke, as well as Danny Gaudet, a local businessman who was Deline?s lead negotiator for  . Sworn in on Sept. 1, the new Deline Got?ine Government is responsible for delivering an array of local programs and services. Mr. Neyelle, 65, tall and   switches easily between English and North Slavey. He said   allowed the residents of Deline to preserve their way of life and to use these traditions to tackle modern problems. In the past, Mr. Gaudet added, people would look only to the national and provincial government for help. Now, Deline would decide what was best for its people. This included making their own decisions about economic development, such as elevating cultural tourism through the   Destination Deline program. ?Just on tourism alone, we think we can probably put everyone to work in this town,? Mr. Gaudet said. Protecting the lake, however, is not just about   and increased tourism. For the Sahtuto?ine, Mr. Neyelle and Mr. Gaudet explained, the lake was a powerful force in the world: a place critical to the survival of the human species. This belief is based on the prophecies of a Sahtuto?ine elder named Eht?se Ayah, who died in 1940. Some believe Mr. Ayah?s prophecies are literal, others believe they are allegory. Mr. Ayah foretold that in the future, people from the south would come to Great Bear Lake because it would be one of the few places left with water to drink and fish to eat. He said so many boats would come that you could walk from one to another without entering the water. Simply put, Great Bear Lake would be a last refuge for humanity. Mr. Gaudet said the predictions were a big reason the new government pushed to have authority over everyone in the area, aboriginal and nonaboriginal alike. If ?hundreds of thousands of people? come because of the prophecies and because ?we have the freshest water in the world,? he said, then ?you have to live under our rules. ? People in Deline told me that the weather had been changing in recent years, and that the summer season was getting longer. The lake is taking longer to freeze, and it?s melting earlier. Mr. Neyelle said climate change added a note of urgency to the prophecies they may come true sooner than expected. ?Maybe we?re in that era now where everything is changing,? he said, and people from the south ?are going to come. ? Late that evening, I walked along Deline?s main street and tried to imagine hundreds of thousands of people coming to the area. It was hard to do. The night sky was overcast, and the temperature had dipped to minus 10 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 23 Celsius). Specks of ice from the   of Great Bear Lake filled the air. The flecks caused outdoor lights to reflect upward, creating optical illusions called light pillars that made it seem as if each light had become a searchlight aimed at the sky. I walked off the road and into a thicket of boreal forest. Hoarfrost from the lake clung to every surface of the trees and bushes. It covered even the undersides of spruce needles. I was hundreds of feet from the shoreline, yet Great Bear Lake was everywhere  ?   in the air, on the ground and in the trees. At 8 the next morning, I awoke to darkness. From November until January, Deline gets less than five hours of sun each day, although it makes up for that between May and July, when it gets over 22 hours daily. Eventually, I saw a glimmer of predawn on the horizon, but it was not until 10:30 a. m. that the first rays of sun peeked out. I walked outside and headed toward the church for Sunday Mass. The round,   structure was in town, on the shore of Great Bear Lake. Chunks and shards of ice lay heaped on the shoreline, while farther out, the surface of the lake was   alternately skimmed white with snow or glistening with ice that froze overnight. A wedge of open water was visible just offshore. It looked turbulent, straining and frothing where it encountered the surface ice, as if it were determined not to freeze. Deline is predominantly Roman Catholic. Inside the church, I witnessed the community?s focus on preserving North Slavey. An elder was leading the congregation in the rosary. His call was in North Slavey, and the response was in a mix of Slavey and English. During the Mass, the Gospel and the homily were in English, followed by an    translation into North Slavey. The language is spoken everywhere  ?   in church, on the streets and at home  ?   as part of a concerted effort to keep it alive. The 2011 Canadian census counted only 225 people who identified the language as their mother tongue. But North Slavey is an official language of the Deline Got?ine Government and of the Northwest Territories. For the moment, North Slavey is not on the verge of extinction. It belongs to a family of North American indigenous languages that includes Apache and Navajo. Children in Deline?s primary school are taught the language this year, an elder began to teach North Slavey to high school students. Mr. Neyelle said the new government wanted to make acquiring and passing on the language a priority because it believed speaking North Slavey was crucial to preserving the culture. ?Slavey is ours,? he said. ?That?s where our powers lay. ? He said his descriptions in Slavey had more depth and color than those in English, even though he was fluent in both. Teenagers I spoke to echoed this thought. They said jokes were funnier in Slavey. After Mass, I walked over to Great Bear Lake, curious about the little skein of open water I had seen hours earlier. To my surprise, it had disappeared. Thinking I was turned around, I kept searching, but saw only the reflective surface of new ice and beyond that, a large field of older,   ice. Mr. Neyelle confirmed that the water had frozen over during the time I was in church. He was not surprised it had happened so quickly. Sometimes, he said, you could actually see ice creeping across open water. His description made it seem like a fox or wolf stalking its prey. We drove to Ski Hill, a gathering place for the community perched on top of a cleared rise near town. The sun had been up for three hours, but already it was getting dark. Several pickup trucks were parked close together, next to a recently built hut with a blazing fire pit in the middle. Children were sledding (despite the name of the hill, no one actually skis there) and some of the adults were   a new snowmobile with a powerful engine. Strips of lake trout along with moose meat and hot dogs cooked on top of barrel grills. The atmosphere was festive, perhaps because it seemed as if Great Bear Lake was finally freezing over. This meant access to the entire lake, better fishing and, eventually, an ice road that would temporarily connect Deline to the outside world. Or perhaps it was festive because these were friends gathering on a Sunday to enjoy the sunset, grilled food and conversation in North Slavey and in English. It reminded me that despite the groundbreaking nature of Deline?s   and Unesco status, it was still a small town. The type of town where the phone directory is a piece of paper taped to the wall. One elder I met there was Charlie Neyelle, 72, Morris Neyelle?s older brother and the elders? representative on the K?aowedo Ke. Charlie Neyelle is a spiritual and mental health guide for the community, and pushed for   and preservation of Great Bear Lake. I asked him a question I had posed to many people during my time in Deline: What does Great Bear Lake mean to you? In response, Mr. Neyelle told me the   story, about a Sahtuto?ine ancestor who lived around Great Bear Lake, in an area called Caribou Point. One day the fisherman set out four hooks. When the fisherman returned to check on them, a lake trout had broken one of the lines and taken the hook. This bothered the fisherman, because in those days, hooks were extremely valuable. So that night, he transformed himself into a losch, also known as burbot, a freshwater version of cod. The fisherman swam down to the middle of the lake to look for the hook and heard a booming sound. There, at the bottom, he saw a gigantic beating heart. All the species of fish  ?   trout, whitefish, pickerel, herring, suckers  ?   faced the heart, surrounding and protecting it. He swam back to shore after seeing this, and the following morning when he went to check on his three hooks, he found three trout. One of them had the hook he had lost the day before dangling from its mouth. When the fisherman saw the   he realized Great Bear Lake was alive, Mr. Neyelle said. ?The lake gives life to the universal: grass, insects, willow, everything. ? Some in Deline believe that the   at the bottom of the lake gives life to all of the lakes, oceans and rivers in the world. For the Sahtuto?ine, this belief underscores not only why Great Bear Lake must be protected, but also why its protection is of global importance. Toward the end of our conversation, Mr. Neyelle also mentioned Eht?se Ayah?s prophecy. ?When there is no food or water all around the world, many will come to Great Bear Lake,? he said. ?It will be one of the last places that has both. ? No matter how many times I heard this apocalyptic prediction, it was jarring to hear, especially when inserted into conversations about Great Bear Lake?s beauty and providence. The regular evocation of this prophecy reminded me of what happened on the other side of the lake in the 1940s, in Port Radium. The site of a large uranium ore mine, it was the most significant industrial development in Great Bear Lake?s history. During World War II, uranium from Port Radium was sent to the United States for the war effort, where it provided much of the material for the Manhattan Project and the atomic bombs that fell on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Although it stopped producing uranium in 1960 and is now abandoned, Port Radium was at its peak larger than Deline. Irene Kodakin was born near Port Radium in 1952, when the mine was still in operation. Now living in Deline, she describes Port Radium as a thriving community of aboriginal and nonaboriginal workers brought to work in the mines. Ms. Kodakin has happy memories of her childhood, in stark contrast to her experience in a residential school in Inuvik, a town more than 400 miles away. For much of the 20th century, the Canadian government forced many aboriginal children into these schools, with the goal of assimilating them into Canadian culture. ?They would put their hand in our mouths and just press our bottom lips to our teeth until it bleeds? if you speak Slavey, she said. When she returned home, she could no longer speak North Slavey. Her older sister had to translate when Ms. Kodakin spoke to her own father. A generation of Sahtuto?ine lived and worked at Port Radium. Although it was known at the time that exposure to uranium was dangerous, this warning did not reach them. Long after the mine closed, Sahtuto?ine who had been in Port Radium began to die of various cancers. Ms. Kodakin?s father, George Kodakin, who had become a respected    chief in Deline, died of cancer at age 64. Ms. Kodakin?s older sister, aunts and uncles also died of it, and she believes the mine was the cause. Ms. Kodakin?s belief is shared by many in the community, including Gina Beyha, a coordinator for the Unesco Biosphere Reserve who was a nurse in Deline for 15 years. While researching links between cancer and Port Radium, Ms. Beyha and others discovered that uranium taken from the sacred Great Bear Lake was most likely used in the bombs that detonated over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Many people, especially the elders, were aghast, Ms. Beyha said. In 1998, Deline sent a delegation to Japan for the annual Hiroshima Peace Memorial Ceremony. It was a gesture of atonement as well as a way to start healing, particularly for the widows of men who had worked at Port Radium, who made traditional gifts that the delegation presented to the Japanese. During my time in Deline, the legacies of Port Radium and the residential schools were among many reasons people gave for protecting Great Bear Lake and for negotiating  . The others: to preserve Sahtuto?ine culture, to develop tourism, to honor elders and ancestors, and to prepare for the realization of Eht?se Ayah?s prophecies. After a week of talking with many Deline residents, these reasons all seemed tightly connected and at the core of the community?s identity. Those not living on Great Bear Lake, however, gave another reason that was perhaps the simplest of all. The lake, like the Mona Lisa, is magnificent. It draws the gaze as an ocean does. The slate blue ice and white snow merge seamlessly into the sky so that when you leave the shoreline, with brittle tiles of ice cracking underfoot, it feels like stepping into a cloud. And in the brief moments when the wind dies down, the silence is as deep and enormous as the lake itself. During my last days in the area, I went exploring with a Deline resident, Leeroy Andre, his wife, Diane, and his    daughter, Whitney. We would leave at sunrise and plunge into the boreal forest, following trails and old seismic lines. In the distance lay the frozen sheet of Great Bear Lake, and beyond, thick rolls of mist rose toward the sun, evidence of open water at the edge of the horizon. In North Slavey, this mist is called  . It is a land of ptarmigan and marten, musk ox, caribou, moose, wolf and bear. One day, after we had been out four hours, we came across a huge abandoned beaver lodge at least six feet high and twice as long. Around then, despite my wearing several layers, a parka and other gear, the cold started after me. It crept up from the ground onto my snowmobile. It cracked the rubber of my boots and shouldered inside. If I concentrated, I could feel ice crystals forming in my toes. When we started moving again, the cold took on the shape of a blanket and patiently tried to cover my shoulders and back. At sunset, the moon appeared like a slender comma above the trees, glowing in the   sky. We drove through marshmallow mounds: berry bushes covered in snow and hoarfrost for most of the year before they emerge in the summer and grow leaves and berries as fast as they can. Dark came quickly, and we sped across yet another small lake connected to Great Bear Lake. The snowmobile?s headlight illuminated a blizzard of snowflakes as shiny as diamonds, as if the land were showing what true wealth looked like. The northern lights appeared like a hallucination across the   sky. For hours they moved in slow motion above me, as the land seemed to recede and I faced the cosmos. If a recent scientific theory proves correct, somewhere out in space is the origin of the earth?s water, which fills Great Bear Lake and gives us life. This connected with something I was told when I first arrived in Deline. To the Sahtuto?ine, Great Bear Lake is not just a lake. They are part of it and it is part of them. No longer does this seem like a belief unique to their culture  ?   it sounds like a universal truth. The water from Great Bear Lake flows in our veins, too."
17681,Benjamin Hoffman,17/01/2017,2017,1,lifestyle,"Road teams finally found the success they were missing in this season?s playoffs, with Green Bay and Pittsburgh advancing to the conference championships. Both will have to repeat that road success if either team wants to make it to Super Bowl LI in Houston, as the Packers will travel to Atlanta and the Steelers will be on their way to New England. Here?s a quick preview of the conference championships: No. 4 Green Bay Packers ( ) at No. 2 Atlanta Falcons ( ) Time: 3:05 p. m. Eastern, Fox Spread: Falcons are favored by 4. They say ?defense wins championships,? but the N. F. C. will almost assuredly be decided by which team?s superstar quarterbacks is able to do more damage. Aaron Rodgers has led the Green Bay Packers to eight consecutive wins, repeatedly delivering under intense   pressure, and Matt Ryan looks like a completely different player than the one who struggled in recent seasons. Green Bay will be trying to win a a second consecutive playoff game on the road, and Atlanta, after an easy win over Seattle in the divisional round, will be trying to reach the Super Bowl for the first time since the 1998 season. No. 3 Pittsburgh Steelers ( ) at No. 1 New England Patriots ( ) Time: 6:40 p. m. Eastern, CBS Spread: Patriots are favored by 6. At one point during the season the Patriots seemed nearly unbeatable, but they have had to work far harder in recent weeks to keep things going. The Steelers, meanwhile, have hit their stride defensively, with an offense led by the usual suspects of Ben Roethlisberger, Le?Veon Bell and Antonio Brown. It will be New England?s 11th appearance in the A. F. C. championship game in the 16 seasons of the Tom Brady Era, and the team will be trying to reach the Super Bowl for the seventh time in that span. The Steelers, who have won two Super Bowls with Roethlisberger, are hoping to make an appearance in the game for the fourth time in 12 seasons. Here?s how all four teams got here: It may not have been the type of game the Pittsburgh Steelers prefer to play, with all of the team?s scoring coming from their kicker?s foot, but in the playoffs a win is a win. And the Steelers? ugly   victory over the Kansas City Chiefs was just enough to earn the team a trip to New England to face the Patriots in the A. F. C. championship game. It was a game largely defined by Pittsburgh?s inability to punch the ball into the end zone after moving the ball well between the   lines. The game?s biggest moment came near the end when Sean Davis, the Steelers? defensive back whose    hit helped set up a late touchdown for Kansas City, was able to help break up the Chiefs?   conversion attempt that would have tied the game. The Steelers wasted a tremendous effort by running back Le?Veon Bell, who broke his own franchise postseason record by gaining 170 yards on 30 carries. Despite Bell?s success, Pittsburgh was forced to turn to Chris Boswell, the team?s kicker, for a postseason record six field goals, breaking the previous record of five that been accomplished eight times. In an   interview after the game, Boswell rejected the notion that he was the team?s newest ?Killer B? along with Ben Roethlisberger, Antonio Brown and Bell. ?It was just about doing my job,? Boswell said. ?Come out here and put it through the yellow pipes and don?t really think too much, don?t think ?I?m the guy? or anything. ? The Chiefs had started the game well, becoming the first team this season to score against Pittsburgh on an opening drive, but the offense went quiet after that, managing one field goal and one late touchdown which was too little, too late. Pittsburgh?s defense largely eliminated Tyreek Hill, the Chiefs? versatile offensive weapon. He was limited to 18 rushing yards and 27 receiving yards, serving as a decoy on many of Kansas City?s plays. The Steelers will now go on the road against New England trying to earn its fourth trip to the Super Bowl in the Ben Roethlisberger era. ?I think it?s going to be a showdown,? Bell said in a televised interview. ?Obviously, two great quarterbacks going    two of the best teams in the A. F. C. so it?s time to settle it next week. ? The Green Bay Packers could not hold on to a huge early lead, but in the game?s final seconds Aaron Rodgers was given one more chance to score, and his long completion to Jared Cook set up Mason Crosby?s     field goal in a   victory over the Dallas Cowboys that earned the Packers a trip to the N. F. C. championship game next week against Atlanta. After a string of boring playoff blowouts this season, all won by home teams, Green Bay bucked the trend in a thrilling game in which the Packers raced to a   lead only to slowly let Dallas back into the game. The Cowboys tied it up at   before the teams traded long field goals, with Crosby?s   and   makes beating out the   from Dan Bailey that nearly resulted in overtime. There were offensive fireworks on both sides, as Rodgers threw for 356 yards and 2 touchdowns while Dak Prescott, the Cowboys? Cinderella story at quarterback, threw for 302 yards and 3 touchdowns. While Rodgers walked away with the win, Prescott showed exactly why the team confidently kept him as the team?s starter even after longtime starter Tony Romo was declared healthy. In the end, however, Rodgers had just enough to overcome Dallas? furious comeback. He rattled the Cowboys? defense all game, catching them moving too slowly on substitutions, taking advantage of penalties, and deftly avoiding the rush to set up passing plays. And on the final drive, when his team needed him most, he found Cook downfield for a shocking   gain that set up Crosby?s  . Cook just barely got his feet down before going out of bounds, with the play requiring a review after officials disagreed about whether or not he made the catch. Rodgers was all smiles in an   interview after the game, saying the game was fun. But when asked about what he was thinking as his long pass to Cook was reeled in, he gave all the credit to Cook. ?It was a great catch by Jared,? Rodgers said, adding ?It?s just kind of schoolyard at times late in the game like that. ? Rodgers was forced to play the entire game without his top wide receiver, Jordy Nelson, but he was able to succeed thanks to strong games from Cook, Davante Adams and Randall Cobb. Ty Montgomery, the wide    back, chipped in with 11 carries for 47 yards and 2 touchdowns, while also catching 6 passes for 34 yards. That the game was left to Crosby?s strong right leg may have worried some Packers fans, but the veteran kicker had an incredible final four minutes of the game. His   make set a franchise playoff record, and he had to make the   attempt twice as Dallas used a timeout to erase his first attempt. While the   was a fairly low kick, it easily made it over the crossbar, completing the Green Bay victory. Green Bay has now won eight consecutive games after Rodgers vowed to ?run the table? following the team?s loss to Washington in Week 11. While the quarterback?s long streak without an interception finally ended in the second half, he continued to show off the M. V. P. form that had eluded him in the first half of the season. The loss ended what had been a remarkable season for Dallas, a team that captured the No. 1 seed in the N. F. C. despite losing Romo during the preseason and being forced to hand over the offense to Prescott, a   draft pick who few expected to play, let alone start. But Prescott and Ezekiel Elliott, along with some tremendous play by the team?s offensive line, formed an offense that few could keep up with. As the No. 4 seed in the conference, Green Bay will travel to face the No.   Falcons in Atlanta next Sunday. ? Matt Ryan led the Atlanta Falcons to a   win over the Seattle Seahawks and heard choruses of ?M. V. P.! M. V. P. !? which seemed justified by his     performance. That his return to the playoffs was a huge success against Seattle?s Legion of Boom secondary was quite an accomplishment, though it comes with the asterisk of Earl Thomas having missed the game. Thomas, the   safety, was sorely missed, especially on a      by running back Devonta Freeman, who executed a fake that left Thomas?s replacement, Steven Terrell, grasping at air as he fell to the turf. ? The Houston Texans? defense was the only thing keeping the team together all season, and the unit did its best in a lopsided loss to the New England Patriots in which the team intercepted Tom Brady twice but also saw Dion Lewis become the first player in the Super Bowl era to score touchdowns on a run, a pass and a kickoff return in a playoff game. The   Houston defense got little help from Brock Osweiler, the team?s quarterback who seemed to change a few minds last week, then reminded everyone of his flaws with three interceptions on Saturday. Even with a   victory for the Patriots, the game showed a great number of flaws for New England going forward. Pretty or not, the Patriots are headed to the team?s 11th conference championship game in the last 16 seasons."
17877,Beverly Gage,23/01/2017,2017,1,crime,"The anxiety began well before the Cleveland convention, where the candidate of the ?Forgotten Men,? the one who declared Americans ?the greatest Race on the face of this old Earth,? seemed likely to clinch his party?s presidential nomination. Doremus Jessup, the protagonist of Sinclair Lewis?s 1935 novel ?It Can?t Happen Here,? sees something dark and terrible brewing in American politics  ?   the potential for ?a real fascist dictatorship? led by the    populist candidate Berzelius Windrip. Friends scoff at this extravagant concern. ?That couldn?t happen here in America, not possibly!? they assure him. But Jessup, a   Vermont newspaper editor and a ?mild, rather indolent and somewhat sentimental liberal,? worries about the devastation ahead. ?What can I do?? he agonizes night after night. ?Oh  ?   write another editorial    I suppose!? When Election Day comes to pass, Jessup learns that his editorials have not done the trick. The reality of the new situation feels unspeakably awful, ?like the   passing of a friend. ? Jessup faces the presidential inauguration in a state of high distress, convinced that the nation is careering toward its doom, but that nobody  ?   least of all his fellow liberals  ?   can do much to stop it. ?It Can?t Happen Here? is a work of dystopian fantasy, one man?s effort in the 1930s to imagine what it might look like if fascism came to America. At the time, the obvious specter was Adolf Hitler, whose rise to power in Germany provoked fears that men like the Louisiana senator Huey Long or the radio priest Charles Coughlin might accomplish a similar feat in the United States. Today, Lewis?s novel is making a comeback as an analogy for the Age of Trump. Within a week of the 2016 election, the book was reportedly sold out on Amazon. com. At a moment when instability seems to be the only constant in American politics, ?It Can?t Happen Here? offers an alluring (if terrifying) certainty: It can happen here, and what comes next will be even ghastlier than you expect. Yet the graphic horrors of Lewis?s vision also limit the book?s usefulness as a guide to our own political moment. In 1935, Lewis was trying to prevent the unthinkable: the election of a   candidate to the presidency of the United States. Today?s readers, by contrast, are playing   scrambling to think through the implications of an electoral fait accompli. If Lewis?s postelection vision is what awaits us, there will be little cause for hope, or even civic engagement, in the months ahead. The only viable options will be to get out of the country  ?   or to join an armed underground resistance. Lewis?s second wife, the journalist Dorothy Thompson, provided much of the inspiration for ?It Can?t Happen Here. ? In 1931, she interviewed Hitler, scoffing at his ?startling insignificance? when encountered   . Back in the United States, Thompson interviewed Huey Long, who had vowed to challenge Franklin Roosevelt for the presidency in 1936. She noted that Long?s populist message and swaggering style reminded her of Hitler, and according to Lewis?s biographer, Richard Lingeman, Lewis took the message to heart. A recent Nobel Prize winner, known for his superhuman productivity, Lewis churned out the entire manuscript of ?It Can?t Happen Here? between May and August of 1935. The novel arrived in bookstores that October. By that point, some of the immediate threat had passed. (On Sept. 8, 1935, Long was assassinated at the Louisiana State Capitol, one of the great political traumas of the 1930s.) Lewis?s book nonetheless sold 320, 000 copies, becoming his most popular work to date. Reviewers agreed that the book?s success had little to do with its literary merits though ?a vigorous   tract,? one critic noted, it was ?not much of a novel. ? What propelled its popularity was a sense of urgency, the worry that the United States  ?   like the nations of Western Europe  ?   might contain dark forces yet to be unleashed. A slightly different sense of urgency seems to be fueling the book?s latest surge in popularity. We have already experienced some of what Lewis describes in the first third of the book: a blustery populist candidate rising, against all odds, to the presidency of the United States. Now the great question is whether or not we are moving into Lewis?s terrifying future. The novel?s Everyman candidate, Berzelius (Buzz) Windrip, is hardly a perfect   for Trump. A creature of the Great Depression and a Democrat, Windrip sweeps into office as a   promising $3, 000 to $5, 000 for every ?real American family. ? His movement style evokes the   of Nazi Germany rather than the anonymous jabs of the Twitter mob. Still, there are enough points of resonance to cause palpitations in the heart of any anxious   liberal. Like Trump, Windrip sells himself as the champion of ?Forgotten Men,? determined to bring dignity and prosperity back to America?s white working class. Windrip loves big, passionate rallies and rails against the ?lies? of the mainstream press. His supporters embrace this message, lashing out against the ?highbrow intellectuality? of editors and professors and policy elites. With Windrip?s encouragement, they also take out their frustrations on blacks and Jews. The architect of Windrip?s campaign is a savvy newsman named Lee Sarason, the novel?s closest approximation of Steve Bannon. It is Sarason, not Windrip, who actually writes ?Zero Hour,? the candidate?s popular jeremiad on national decline. Sarason believes in propaganda, not information, openly arguing that ?it is not fair to ordinary folks  ?   it just confuses them  ?   to try to make them swallow all the true facts that would be suitable to a higher class of people. ? This is where the novel comes to rest by Inauguration Day: Through a combination of deception and charisma, the feared Windrip ascends to the presidency while the nation?s liberals tremble. It is only after the inauguration, though, that ?It Can?t Happen Here? takes a truly dark turn. Upon moving into the White House, Windrip immediately declares Congress an ?advisory? body, stripped of all real power. When members of Congress resist, he locks them up without the slightest semblance of due process, the beginning of the end for American democracy. The rest of the book describes one long, disorienting nightmare, a national descent into labor camps and torture chambers and martial law. The novel gains its energy from Jessup?s internal struggle, his regret at having done so little to stop it all while he still could. ?The tyranny of this dictatorship isn?t primarily the fault of Big Business, nor of the demagogues who do their dirty work,? he realizes. ?It?s the fault of Doremus Jessup! Of all the conscientious, respectable,   Doremus Jessups, who have let the demagogues wriggle in, without fierce enough protest. ? With this heavy hand, Lewis seeks not only to satirize American liberals, but to induce them to pay attention before it?s too late. While the book skewers Jessup?s passivity, however, it does little to suggest viable modes of engagement under the Windrip regime, short of abandoning home and family and fleeing to Canada. Every time Jessup attempts some modest act of resistance, he is met with the ruthless repression of the state. When Jessup prints a righteous editorial, Windrip?s goons arrest him and murder his   . Jessup ends up as a   in a concentration camp, beaten down but determined to carry on. Six months into his sentence, he escapes and joins the underground movement percolating in Canada  ?   where, the book implies, he should have gone in the first place. The one bright spot for the   forces is that things don?t work out particularly well for anyone else. Windrip never follows through on his pledge to restore prosperity and redistribute wealth, fueling conflict with his early supporters, who mostly end up dead or in jail. Even Windrip himself gets little of what he wants. As president, he insists on absolute obedience, ?louder, more convincing Yeses from everybody about him. ? After two years of this treatment, his crafty aide Sarason maneuvers the president into exile, only to be deposed himself a month later in a military coup. By the book?s closing pages, Jessup has returned to the United States as a disciplined resistance fighter, organizing armed rebellions throughout the Midwest. His transformation illustrates Lewis?s most powerful message: When it happens here, everyone should be prepared to resist. But Jessup?s story also underscores how difficult it can be to sort out what to do at moments of swift political change and social confusion. In our brave imaginations, we undoubtedly do the right thing when fascism comes to America. In reality, we might not recognize it while it?s happening."
17997,Christine Hauser,27/01/2017,2017,1,crime,"The news can seem grim. Refugee crises, extreme weather and wars plague the globe. Cellphones have exploded. America is bitterly divided. Mary Tyler Moore died. Even the doomsday clock has been reset. But we thought you could use a break, whatever your politics, your fears, your troubles. The nation?s zoos agree. Welcome to the Great National Cute Animal   of 2017. Over the past two days, zoos and aquariums have dominated the conversation on Twitter with photo after photo of adorable animals. And the world cracked a smile. It all started, according to  The   with a Smithsonian National Zoo announcement on Wednesday of the birth of a female gray seal on Jan. 21, a pup described as ?nursing, moving and bonding well with mom. ? The baby?s mother, a    gray seal named Kara, set a record for being the oldest seal of her kind to give birth in a zoo. (The Washington Post even had a Facebook Live presentation of her ultrasound in December.) The seal?s birth was a reminder that gray seals moved from the endangered list to being a species of least concern in 2016 by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Their numbers rose to more than 600, 000 worldwide. The Smithsonian birth announcement set off a ripple online, and generated a hashtag  ?   #CuteAnimalTweetOff  ?   which grew into a viral phenomenon as zoos posted photos of cute and fuzzy pandas, otters, orangutans and tiger cubs. There is even a baby turtle, as well as a pun or two, in the fray. ?Here we have an otterly adorable submission to #CuteAnimalTweetOff,? the Aquarium of the Pacific said on Twitter with a photo of otters. ?Leapin? Lemurs the #cuteanimaltweetoff is going strong,? the Maryland Zoo wrote with a photo of a lemur. The postings have gone international, suggesting that maybe, just maybe, we can find common ground across borders by looking at cute animals. The ZSL London Zoo raised the bar with a few seconds of video of its tiger cubs Karis and Achilles, born in June. Sarah Janet Hill, a host at Radio Free Radio in Hampton, Va. has been credited with giving the Smithsonian announcement the online bump it needed to spread. ?I thought, ?Our seals are cuter than that,? ? Ms. Hill is quoted as saying in The  . So she retweeted the announcement to the Virginia Aquarium and Marine Science Center, which took up the challenge. The viral response to the pup?s birth announcement has been a pleasant surprise for the Smithsonian Zoo. Annalisa Meyer, a spokeswoman, said on Thursday that the seal pup had not yet been given a name, a process that includes taking suggestions from the public or giving a sponsor the opportunity to come up with one. ?We have never set off a cute animal challenge,? Ms. Meyer said. ?Will it be the last? Maybe not. We are open to more cute  . ? But to what end? Maybe the point is just relief from the drumbeat of sober news. ?It?s been a really fun day, and I?m just glad there was something light to talk about today,? Ms. Hill told The  . ?There?s been some heavy news lately, and it?s been fun to distract people with this fun stuff. ? ?Everyone wants their zoo to win,? she added, but really, there were no winners or losers in the standoff. Just cute animals."
17447,Timothy Williams,7/01/2017,2017,1,science,"TOPEKA, Kan.  ?   Timothy Shahid and Joshua Kalina met, went drinking, became friends and then had a falling out that lead to the murder of one of the young men, all in a matter of hours. The victim?s mother, her life suddenly a disordered jumble marked by panic attacks and nightmares, decided to seek out her son?s killer to try to understand what had prompted an act of violence so baffling that even the gunman was at a loss.  With the aid of a restorative justice program, which brings together victims and those who have caused them harm, the two ultimately met  ?   each seeking a way out of grief, fear and guilt. Here?s a look at Timothy, Joshua and Joshua?s mother as she becomes involved in the program. (In this related article, read about a meeting between the parents of a college student and the man convicted in the   accident that killed their son.) ?I probably broke my mom?s heart when I told her that,? Timothy, now 30, said. ?The road I was leading, I knew I was going to end up in one of those two places. ? At 14, Timothy and some other boys robbed a pawnshop, and he spent two years in a juvenile facility. By age 16, he was ?religiously? carrying a gun that he sometimes used. He did not elaborate. ?Hanging out with a group of kids gave me hope,? said Timothy, who was tormented by his adoption, and the parents he never knew. ?I didn?t think my biological mother loved me. ? At the time of the shooting, Timothy was working at a telemarketing center. He spent his free hours smoking pot and drinking at least a pint of Hennessy a day. He customized the black 2005 Nissan Altima with special wheel rims, and was methodical about keeping the car looking pristine. Joshua grew up in Topeka with his mother, Judi Bergquist, and was especially close to his older brother. He liked to play practical jokes on those close to him. ?He was so funny,? his mother said. He had severe attention deficit disorder and graduated from an alternative high school. Problems with social anxiety prompted him to wear a St. Louis Cardinals baseball cap pulled low over his face. Ms. Bergquist said Joshua began hanging out with what she described as a ?rougher? group of friends after graduating, so she sent him to Texas to live with her parents. He returned to Topeka about two years later and found work at a   service. But persistent money problems forced him to rely on his mother and grandmother. ?The day he died, he called me in the late afternoon,? Ms. Bergquist said. ?He was extremely upset because my mom had shut off his cellphone and he had a car payment to make. ? He?d screamed at her. A few hours later, she said Joshua drove slowly by her house but didn?t stop. It was the last time she saw him alive. Hours later, Timothy and Joshua met for the first time through a mutual friend. The two seemed to hit it off. ?He didn?t come off as a person I couldn?t get along with. I was easy to get along with,? Timothy said. ?I rode around with Josh in his car. ? But as the night of April 23, 2007, wore on, their easy conversation deteriorated into bickering, and the two argued loudly while drinking at a bar. ?He said something about one of my friends, so I said something about one of his friends,? said Timothy, who called someone to pick him up. ?We were going out the door at the same time, still arguing. I actually opened his car door and then I walk off. I just told him to get in the car. That?s when me and his friend, we?re arguing now . .. All I see was him pull out a weapon . .. I thought he had a gun. ? He fired eight times, and a friend of Timothy?s fired twice more before they fled, the police said. Joshua was left in the parking lot with four gunshot wounds in the chest, one in the left hip, two in the buttocks and three in the left hand. ?My   was it was better him than me,? Timothy said. ?I didn?t believe in fighting. I just pulled out my gun. I actually ran up to him when I shot him. I don?t blame alcohol. I knew what I was doing. I just saw something in his hand. ? Joshua was unarmed, police said Timothy?s accomplice was never arrested. During pretrial hearings, Timothy would see Ms. Bergquist in the courtroom, and at one court appearance, he taunted her. ?I actually took her son?s photo, and held it up and turned around, and that?s when I laughed at her,? he said. Ms. Bergquist, suffering from memory loss and insomnia, panicked every time she saw a tall   man  ?   the loose description of Timothy?s accomplice. ?If I saw anybody with that vague description, I would just lose it,? she said. Finally, wanting to avoid a trial, Ms. Bergquist agreed to a plea deal in which Timothy would receive about 20 years. Timothy was impassive: ?I didn?t care about life. ? ?I knew that Timothy held the answers that I needed. I needed reassurance from Timothy that the other person was never going to bother me,? said Ms. Bergquist. ?I needed to feel safe. At the same time, I needed to know if Timothy was working to change his life. I didn?t want this to happen to anyone else. ? The first step toward a meeting came after a prison official showed Timothy an article that Ms. Bergquist had written about Joshua. Ms. Bergquist also contacted Holly Chavez, the restorative justice coordinator at the Kansas Department of Corrections, and asked whether a    meeting would be possible. Timothy was also growing more introspective. He was reading the Bible as well as a book that included a passage that seemed written for him: ?If you always do what you always did, you always get what you always got. ? The solitude of prison forced him to try to figure out who he was. ?I had a lot of time,? he said. ?You got to deal with a lot of stuff on your own. It made me go back and look at the things in my life. I became Christian. I understood forgiveness  ?   that I took a life that I can never give back. ? What follows is a discussion of the reactions of Timothy and Ms. Bergquist as they worked with Ms. Chavez toward a    encounter. The excerpts, which are from separate interviews that took place after the meeting, capture the thinking of those involved.

18126,Jane E. Brody,14/02/2017,2017,2,lifestyle,"Most people say ?I?m sorry? many times a day for a host of trivial affronts  ?   accidentally bumping into someone or failing to hold open a door. These apologies are easy and usually readily accepted, often with a response like, ?No problem. ? But when ?I?m sorry? are the words needed to right truly hurtful words, acts or inaction, they can be the hardest ones to utter. And even when an apology is offered with the best of intentions, it can be seriously undermined by the way in which it is worded. Instead of eradicating the emotional pain the affront caused, a poorly worded apology can result in lasting anger and antagonism, and undermine an important relationship. I admit to a lifetime of challenges when it comes to apologizing, especially when I thought I was right or misunderstood or that the offended party was being overly sensitive. But I recently discovered that the need for an apology is less about me than the person who, for whatever reason, is offended by something I said or did or failed to do, regardless of my intentions. I also learned that a sincere apology can be powerful medicine with surprising value for the giver as well as the recipient. After learning that a neighbor who had assaulted me verbally was furious about an oversight I had not known I committed, I wrote a letter in hopes of defusing the hostility. Without offering any excuses, I apologized for my lapse in etiquette and respect. I said I was not asking for or expecting forgiveness, merely that I hoped we could have a civil, if not friendly, relationship going forward, then delivered the letter with a jar of my homemade jam. Expecting nothing in return, I was greatly relieved when my doorbell rang and the neighbor thanked me warmly for what I had said and done. My relief was palpable. I felt as if I?d not only discarded an enemy but made a new friend, which is indeed how it played out in the days that followed. About a week later I learned that, according to the psychologist and author Harriet Lerner, the wording of my apology was just what the ?doctor? would have ordered. In the very first chapter of her new book, ?Why Won?t You Apologize? ,? Dr. Lerner points out that apologies followed by rationalizations are ?never satisfying? and can even be harmful. ?When ?but? is tagged on to an apology,? she wrote, it?s an excuse that counters the sincerity of the original message. The best apologies are short and don?t include explanations that can undo them. Nor should a request for forgiveness be part of an apology. The offended party may accept a sincere apology but still be unready to forgive the transgression. Forgiveness, should it come, may depend on a demonstration going forward that the offense will not be repeated. ?It?s not our place to tell anyone to forgive or not to forgive,? Dr. Lerner said in an interview. She disputes popular thinking that failing to forgive is bad for one?s health and can lead to a life mired in bitterness and hate. ?There is no one path to healing,? she said. ?There are many roads to letting go of corrosive emotions without forgiving, like therapy, meditation, medication, even swimming. ? Hardest of all, Dr. Lerner said, is to forgive a nonapologetic offender, like my aunt whom I had loved dearly and who served as my second mother after mine died. But when I, raised Jewish, married a Christian, she refused to come to the wedding and never apologized for the intense hurt her absence had caused. Although I made several attempts to restore the relationship, she always managed to deflect them, and to this day, more than half a century later, I cannot forgive her. The focus of an apology should be on what the offender has said or done, not on the person?s reaction to it. Saying ?I?m sorry you feel that way? shifts the focus away from the person who is supposedly apologizing and turns ?I?m sorry? into ?I?m not really sorry at all,? the psychologist wrote. As to why many people find it hard to offer a sincere, unfettered apology, Dr. Lerner pointed out that ?humans are   for defensiveness. It?s very difficult to take direct, unequivocal responsibility for our hurtful actions. It takes a great deal of maturity to put a relationship or another person before our need to be right. ? Offering an apology is an admission of guilt that admittedly leaves people vulnerable. There?s no guarantee as to how it will be received. It is the prerogative of the injured party to reject an apology, even when sincerely offered. The person may feel the offense was so enormous  ?   for example, having been sexually abused by a parent  ?   that it is impossible to accept a mea culpa offered by the abusive parent years later. Righting a perceived wrong can be especially challenging when it involves family members, who may be inclined to cite history  ?   he was abused by his father, or she was raised by a distant mother  ?   as an excuse for hurtful behavior. ?History can be used as an explanation, not an excuse,? the psychologist said. ?It should involve a conversation that allows the hurt party to express anger and pain if an apology, however sincere, is to heal a broken connection. ? As she wrote: ?Nondefensive listening [to the hurt party] is at the heart of offering a sincere apology. ? She urges the listener not to ?interrupt, argue, refute, or correct facts, or bring up your own criticisms and complaints. ? Even when the offended party is largely at fault, she suggests apologizing for one?s own part in the incident, however small it may be. Dr. Lerner views apology as ?central to health, both physical and emotional. ?I?m sorry? are the two most healing words in the English language,? she said. ?The courage to apologize wisely and well is not just a gift to the injured person, who can then feel soothed and released from obsessive recriminations, bitterness and corrosive anger. It?s also a gift to one?s own health, bestowing   integrity and maturity  ?   an ability to take a cleareyed look at how our behavior affects others and to assume responsibility for acting at another person?s expense. ? Beverly Engel, the author of ?The Power of Apology,? relates how her life was changed by a sincere, effective apology from her mother for years of emotional abuse. ?Almost like magic,? she wrote, ?apology has the power to repair harm, mend relationships, soothe wounds and heal broken hearts. An apology actually affects the bodily functions of the person receiving it  ?   blood pressure decreases, heart rate slows and breathing becomes steadier. ?"
17948,Jeffrey Gettleman,27/01/2017,2017,1,business,"MOGADISHU, Somalia  ?   When the first explosion rang out, the men on the hotel patio looked up for a moment, then at one another  ?   and kept on eating breakfast. Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, long ago grew accustomed to such jarring sounds, and nobody seemed surprised by a loud bang somewhere not too far away. It took another, even louder explosion a few minutes later to get everyone?s attention. Something fatal was going on. A   of the militiamen who guard the hotel piled into a pickup with their Kalashnikovs and ammunition vests while the photographer Tyler Hicks and I grabbed our gear  ?   cameras, notebooks, bulletproof vests, press credentials, bottles of water  ?   and climbed into an armored truck, slamming the door tight behind us. We headed for the hospital. I have been to Mogadishu many times, but this was my first visit in several years, and when I got to town, I was struck by how much progress the capital seemed to be making. There was still plenty of evidence of the   city of old  ?   the crushed houses, craters and   walls  ?   but there were also new apartment complexes, crowded markets and freshly painted shops selling   TVs. It was even possible to go out for pizza Tuesday night, something I would never have dared before. The scene at the hospital tore at that hopeful illusion. The floor was slippery with blood. Dozens of wounded people streamed in, bleeding from their heads, faces, feet, arms and backs. Some were covered in fine white dust from collapsed walls. Some lay on steel gurneys as squadrons of flies crawled over their shrapnel wounds. Some were clearly in pain. There was confusion, anger, shouting and a lot of sweat. Talking to witnesses, I began to piece together what had happened. Terrorists had struck at another hotel across town from ours, the Dayah: first with a bomb, and then with gunmen spraying fire at hotel guests. The attack ended with a second bomb. By the grim standards of Mogadishu, where terrorist attacks have sometimes killed as many as 50 people in an instant, the toll on Wednesday was not especially large. Government officials said later in the day that about 13 people had been killed, and about 50 had been wounded. The BBC reported that nearly 30 people were dead. No one I spoke to at the hospital had any doubt who was responsible: It must have been the Shabab, they said, meaning the Somali militant organization that has been terrorizing the country for years. The group later claimed responsibility. In the corner of one ward, a young man was lying with a   video camera next to him. He spoke a little English and said he felt good enough to talk. His name was Mohamed Abdihakim, and he was a freelance journalist, making his living filming the mayhem that Mogadishu regularly endures. When he heard the rumble of the first explosion roll across the rooftops like thunder, he said, he jumped into a   (a kind of motorized rickshaw) and urged the driver to head for the rising column of smoke as fast as he could. Along the way, he said, a colleague warned him by phone that it was never a good idea to be the first one on the scene of an attack. But Mr. Abdihakim, 28 and determined, said he had to get there, and he did  ?   in time for the second explosion. He was standing next to some other journalists and filming the scene when the blast knocked them all to the ground. Both his hands were badly injured. ?Do I have any regrets? No,? he said from his hospital bed, wearing mittens of gauze. ?But maybe it?s time to do something else. ? There seemed to be hundreds of people at the hospital, and the crowd thickened by the minute as battered cars raced up with more casualties. Armed men shoved past us, waving guns menacingly at anyone in the way. For more than 25 years since its old central government collapsed, Somalia, one of the world?s poorest nations, has lurched from one crisis to another: civil war, famine, piracy, Islamic militancy. But in the last few years, it seemed as though another war was being waged for Mogadishu?s soul  ?   between residents trying to get on with life and taste a little normalcy and those bent on ruin. Peacekeepers from the African Union have managed to stabilize the main cities in recent years,   militias have calmed down a bit, some foreign investment has flowed in and life has improved. Many roads are newly paved. There are now working streetlights and dry cleaners and cash machines, small miracles in a country that had become a byword for anarchy. Somalia is in the process of selecting a new president, who will be chosen by members of Parliament in the next few weeks. Government officials say the Shabab have been trying to derail that process, and attacked the Dayah Hotel on Wednesday because some newly elected representatives were staying there. A similar explanation appeared on a website associated with the group. The first explosion, officials said, was from a large truck bomb at the hotel gates. Four gunmen stormed in afterward, and the final explosion, a bomb in a minivan, went off about 15 minutes later. Three of the assailants were quickly shot, and the fourth killed himself with a suicide vest, officials said. From photos of their bodies, all appeared to be young, possibly even teenagers. According to Somali authorities, no government officials were killed in the attack. The dead were hotel guards, guests and bystanders."

Playing the beloved young housewife Laura Petrie a few years earlier, Ms. Moore and her TV husband, Dick Van Dyke, had been made to sleep in separate beds. But it was the 1970s now. Even good girls had sex. Ms. Silver and the other women writing for ?The Mary Tyler Moore Show? made sure of it.

There was, however, an   number of female writers on it  ?   well over a dozen in the show?s   run that started in 1970. They were encouraged, she said, to write from their own experience, and to let Mary Richards?s   derive ?organically. ? That made ?The Mary Tyler Moore Show? a laboratory for the social issues of the day, which in some cases were being reflected for the first time on   television. Sex, birth control, equal pay, workplace sexism, homosexuality  ?   all took a turn on the show, and not from the bully pulpit but from the ?girl? who could turn the world on with her smile. Here?s how they played: When Lou Grant (Ed Asner) interviews Mary Richards for an associate producer job in his Minneapolis TV newsroom, he asks questions that women in the workplace often got asked but that weren?t necessarily legal: How old are you? Are you married? Divorced? What religion are you? She calls him out but answers anyway, in the show?s first episode. The point was not belabored but Mary Richards slept with her boyfriends. A   Chicago journalist had suggested that Mary, who was 30 when the series began, was ?undersexed,? Ms. Silver said, and so in Season 3, Ms. Silver wrote an episode in which Mary asked her friend Rhoda if that was the case. A few episodes later, Mary goes on a date and comes home the next morning in the same dress. ?Men across the country wrote to the show in despair over the betrayal of their trust and admiration,? Jennifer Keishin Armstrong wrote in her 2013 book, ?Mary and Lou and Rhoda and Ted: And All the Brilliant Minds That Made ?The Mary Tyler Moore Show? a Classic. ? The third season featured another   handled in a    way. Mary?s friend Phyllis (Cloris Leachman) tries to push her brother into Mary?s arms, but the brother (Robert Moore) is more taken with Phyllis?s archnemesis, Rhoda (Valerie Harper). Phyllis works herself into a lather over this development, until Rhoda puts her out of her misery. ?He?s not my type,? she reassures Phyllis, who remains skeptical. No really, Rhoda says. ?He?s gay. ? Mr. Moore himself was gay, and he embraced the late decision to out the character this plainly, Ms. Armstrong writes in her book, especially since all the laughs were directed at his clueless TV sister. Had the Pill ever been mentioned in a sitcom script before ?Mary Tyler Moore?? If so, the moment has been lost to history. Not long after the   episode, Mary?s father, at loose ends after his retirement, is visiting Mary for dinner at her apartment. Mary?s mother, making her exit, turns at the door. ?Don?t forget to take your pill!? she calls out. ?I won?t,? father and daughter answer in unison. Cut to the comically guilty look on Mary?s face. The Pill had won federal approval in 1960, but it was only that year, 1972, that a Supreme Court decision had made it available to unmarried women. And Mary was unmarried, for all seven seasons. Early hopes to make her a divorc?e from the outset were instantly quashed by queasy executives. ?It used to be I felt I could be myself. Now I feel I represent women everywhere. ? The third season opens with Mary kvetching to Rhoda as she prepares for a meeting at the TV station, where she resents the station manager ?trotting in groups of people and saying, ?This is our woman executive. ?? Her views take on a slightly different cast when she discovers that she makes $50 a week less than the man who had her job before her. She confronts Lou, asking him why. ?Because he was a man,? Lou says. ?The Dick Van Dyke Show? ended just four years before ?The Mary Tyler Moore Show? made its premiere, even though it seemed the two shows were worlds apart. Ms. Moore broke ground in the earlier show, too, though. When the script called for her to vacuum in skirt and heels, she put her foot (in ballet flat) down and her Capri pants on. ?We got the absolution of men everywhere,? she told TV Guide a few years ago, ?and women kind of breathed a sigh of relief, too, and said: ?Hey, that?s right. That?s what we wear. ??"
17283,Carl Hulse,31/12/2016,2016,12,politics,"WASHINGTON  ?   Congressional Republicans have a new fear when it comes to their    health care lawsuit against the Obama administration: They might win. The incoming Trump administration could choose to no longer defend the executive branch against the suit, which challenges the administration?s authority to spend billions of dollars on health insurance subsidies for   and   Americans, handing House Republicans a big victory on    issues. But a sudden loss of the disputed subsidies could conceivably cause the health care program to implode, leaving millions of people without access to health insurance before Republicans have prepared a replacement. That could lead to chaos in the insurance market and spur a political backlash just as Republicans gain full control of the government. To stave off that outcome, Republicans could find themselves in the awkward position of appropriating huge sums to temporarily prop up the Obama health care law, angering conservative voters who have been demanding an end to the law for years. In another twist, Donald J. Trump?s administration, worried about preserving executive branch prerogatives, could choose to fight its Republican allies in the House on some central questions in the dispute. Eager to avoid an ugly political pileup, Republicans on Capitol Hill and the Trump transition team are gaming out how to handle the lawsuit, which, after the election, has been put in limbo until at least late February by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. They are not yet ready to divulge their strategy. ?Given that this pending litigation involves the Obama administration and Congress, it would be inappropriate to comment,? said Phillip J. Blando, a spokesman for the Trump transition effort. ?Upon taking office, the Trump administration will evaluate this case and all related aspects of the Affordable Care Act. ? In a potentially   decision in 2015, Judge Rosemary M. Collyer ruled that House Republicans had the standing to sue the executive branch over a spending dispute and that the Obama administration had been distributing the health insurance subsidies, in violation of the Constitution, without approval from Congress. The Justice Department, confident that Judge Collyer?s decision would be reversed, quickly appealed, and the subsidies have remained in place during the appeal. In successfully seeking a temporary halt in the proceedings after Mr. Trump won, House Republicans last month told the court that they ?and the  ?s transition team currently are discussing potential options for resolution of this matter, to take effect after the  ?s inauguration on Jan. 20, 2017. ? The suspension of the case, House lawyers said, will ?provide the   and his future administration time to consider whether to continue prosecuting or to otherwise resolve this appeal. ? Republican leadership officials in the House acknowledge the possibility of ?cascading effects? if the   payments, which have totaled an estimated $13 billion, are suddenly stopped. Insurers that receive the subsidies in exchange for paying    costs such as deductibles and   for eligible consumers could race to drop coverage since they would be losing money. Over all, the loss of the subsidies could destabilize the entire program and cause a lack of confidence that leads other insurers to seek a quick exit as well. Anticipating that the Trump administration might not be inclined to health care law  a vigorous fight against the House Republicans given the  ?s dim view of the health care law, a team of lawyers this month sought to intervene in the case on behalf of two participants in the health care program. In their request, the lawyers predicted that a deal between House Republicans and the new administration to dismiss or settle the case ?will produce devastating consequences for the individuals who receive these reductions, as well as for the nation?s health insurance and health care systems generally. ? No matter what happens, House Republicans say, they want to prevail on two overarching concepts: the congressional power of the purse, and the right of Congress to sue the executive branch if it violates the Constitution regarding that spending power. House Republicans contend that Congress never appropriated the money for the subsidies, as required by the Constitution. In the suit, which was initially championed by John A. Boehner, the House speaker at the time, and later in House committee reports, Republicans asserted that the administration, desperate for the funding, had required the Treasury Department to provide it despite widespread internal skepticism that the spending was proper. The White House said that the spending was a permanent part of the law passed in 2010, and that no annual appropriation was required  ?   even though the administration initially sought one. Just as important to House Republicans, Judge Collyer found that Congress had the standing to sue the White House on this issue  ?   a ruling that many legal experts said was flawed  ?   and they want that precedent to be set to restore congressional leverage over the executive branch. But on spending power and standing, the Trump administration may come under pressure from advocates of presidential authority to fight the House no matter their shared views on health care, since those precedents could have broad repercussions. It is a complicated set of dynamics illustrating how a quick legal victory for the House in the Trump era might come with costs that Republicans never anticipated when they took on the Obama White House."
17583,Javier C. Hernÿndez,12/01/2017,2017,1,architecture,"BEIJING  ?   For generations, the ?  War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression? has been ingrained in the minds of Chinese schoolchildren. Revolutionary hymns evoked the bloody years, from 1937 to 1945, of what is known outside China as the Second   War. Chinese documentaries denounced Japan?s ?eight years of belligerence. ? Now the war is getting a new name, and an extended time frame. In a move aimed at stirring up nationalism and support for the ruling Communist Party, President Xi Jinping?s government has ordered educators to rewrite textbooks to describe the conflict as the ?  War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression,? lasting from 1931 to 1945, the authorities said in a statement on Wednesday. Under the decision, the Second   War will be described as having started in the fall of 1931, when the Imperial Japanese Army invaded Manchuria. Previously, the war?s beginning had been traced to the Marco Polo Bridge incident, a skirmish in 1937 between Japanese forces and Chinese troops along a rail line southwest of Beijing that represented the beginning of   conflict. The Chinese Ministry of Education said the decision to add six years to the war sought to promote patriotic education and to highlight the Communist Party?s ?core role? in resisting Japanese fascism in the prelude to World War II. It also seemed intended to rally support for the party among young people as Mr. Xi vigorously promotes Communist history and thought in schools. Zhang Lifan, a historian in Beijing, said the decision to revise the length of the war was justified from a historical perspective. But he said it would also have political benefits for the party and would encourage   sentiment. ?Chinese leaders still have a Cold War mentality,? he said. ?They?ve tried to conjure up imaginary enemies in the world. ? Mr. Xi has worked in recent years to enhance the image of the Communists and their achievements in World War II, even though many historians believe it was the Chinese Nationalists, not the Communists, who did most of the fighting. The party had not previously emphasized the fight against the Japanese from 1931 to 1937, when Communist forces were in disarray as they fought a civil war with the Nationalists. During that time, the Nationalists led efforts to resist the Japanese and negotiate truces. It was not until 1937 that the Communists joined forces with the Nationalists to fight an increasingly belligerent Imperial Japanese Army. Kerry Brown, a professor of Chinese politics at King?s College London, called the textbook revision a ?tidying up of history. ? He said the revised account exaggerated the Communists? accomplishments. ?It demonstrates this continuing keenness by the party now to seek sources of legitimacy wherever it can,? he said, ?and reveals more insecurity than real strength. ? The change will probably ruffle feathers in Japan, China?s longtime rival, as the countries jockey for influence in Asia and struggle to overcome the legacy of World War II, more than 70 years after the global conflict ended. Yasuhisa Kawamura, press secretary for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said on Thursday that it was not up to the Chinese government to decide the length of the war. ?It is important that Japan and China should demonstrate they do not focus excessively on the unfortunate past,? he added. Mr. Xi has accused Japan of distorting history, and the Chinese state news media has criticized Tokyo?s efforts to revise textbooks, saying it has played down atrocities by Japanese soldiers. When Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan visited Pearl Harbor last month, Chinese internet users brimmed with outrage, saying Mr. Abe had not done enough to apologize to China for Japan?s actions during the war. In Beijing, many people applauded the government?s decision to revise the textbooks, which are filled with references to wars against ?aggression? by foreign forces. The Korean War, for example, is known as the war to resist United States aggression and aid Korea. ?The Japanese have also altered their textbooks, why can?t we?? said Wang Yalin, 30, a musician. Still, he said, the change would most likely fuel   sentiment in China. Zhao Feng, 38, a tailor, acknowledged that the relationship between the countries had deteriorated. But he said it was important to note the earlier date of Japan?s invasion of China. ?The occupation started much earlier,? he said. On social media, some people were more skeptical of the government?s motives for making the change. ?Don?t use history education for political ends,? one person wrote on Weibo, China?s equivalent of Twitter. ?The most important thing is to learn the truth. ?"
18053,Laura Collins-Hughes,29/01/2017,2017,1,entertainment,"Sitting on a bar stool, the glass in front of him mostly drained, the actor Richard Roxburgh leaned in to make a point. It was early afternoon on a Tuesday, but the muscles in his jaw were slack, his blue eyes vague. He spoke with quiet urgency, his words faintly misshapen, and when he gestured for emphasis, he didn?t seem to notice that his hands were right in my face. The sober boundaries of social behavior had dissolved, abruptly, in an alcoholic haze. That was the idea, of course. Perched in the window of an espresso bar on West 47th Street, drinking nothing stronger than a cortado, Mr. Roxburgh, 55, was demonstrating a   skill: playing drunk. ?In terms of the study of alcohol and its effects, I probably have an unfair advantage in that I am, A, Australian, and, B, an actor,? he said, his eyes perfectly clear now, glinting with humor. ?I?ve had probably an unhealthy overexposure to the shenanigans of booze over time. ? If so, he?s putting it to good use. Through March 19 at the Ethel Barrymore Theater, he?s starring opposite Cate Blanchett in ?The Present,? a Chekhov adaptation that floats along on a vodka tide, gradually snaring his character, Mikhail, in the undertow. (It does not help that Mikhail downs a whole bottle of the stuff in Act III.) Back home, on the Australian television series ?Rake,? Mr. Roxburgh has spent several seasons playing a different sort of alcoholic, a lawyer determined even in middle age to keep the party going. Performing drunkenness requires striking what is, for many actors, an elusive balance  ?   somewhere between sloshy and straight. ?Seeing bad drunk acting is probably like watching an actor trying to squeeze out tears,? Mr. Roxburgh said. ?It?s kind of     excruciating. ? This is his advice for getting it right. ?That would be my first question always: Why are you doing it?? Mr. Roxburgh said. ?Because we all do it for a reason. ? How to play the character, and the drunkenness, depends in part on the answer. ?A lot of what I do is instinctual in a way,? Mr. Roxburgh said, ?and it?s based on observations that I made over a life of being surrounded by Australian actors, and stealing from it. ? Well, that and muscle memory a family man these days, he drinks less than he used to. But he?s familiar with the moment when a pleasant buzz gives way to a loss of control, and he recognizes the difference between sanguine drunks and the darker sorts, like Mikhail, whose vodka demons keep him company. Mr. Roxburgh stood up, planting his feet some distance apart. ?There?s a stance that might happen at a certain point, which is a kind of slightly wider leg stance. If your legs are together, your center of gravity is a much more dangerous element, and you will literally fall over. A very drunk person, the room is doing this for them,? he said, tilting his arms from one side to another. ?It?s as if they?re on a ship at sea. ? That doesn?t mean they will lurch or clutch, but they might rest a hand on a chair, ?just for a little bit of support,? a fixed point of physical reference. ?The more you try and stand up straight, there?s always a part of you that has to know the world is spinning. ? ?There?s also a very subtle kind of tipping that might happen in the body,? Mr. Roxburgh said, and as he leaned, his eyes clouded over. For a moment, he might have been utterly wasted. ?Another element is the gaze, which is that famous   thing where somebody is talking to you, but they?re not quite there. The world is bleary to them, and your face at a certain point becomes, to all intents and purposes, pixelated. So they?re not looking with any clarity into your eyes. ? ?It?s fascinating reading things like the police studies into blood alcohol levels and what they actually do to your response times? behind the wheel, Mr. Roxburgh said. ?The same thing obviously applies in terms of your conversation, your responses, the way you inhale and feed out information just in the normal sense of conversation when you?re drunk. ?But it can be very subtle stuff, I suppose the way you might slightly stutter on a word or rethink the way that you?re going to go into a sentence. It blocks clear thinking that?s a fact. ? Counterintuitive, yes, but Mr. Roxburgh was adamant that this is an essential part of playing drunk: struggling against the sloppier effects of inebriation rather than giving in to them. ?Remember that the person that you?re playing almost invariably doesn?t want to appear drunk,? he said. ?In bad drunk acting, you see somebody wobbling around all over the place and slurring their words in a very overt way. ? In the real world, though, the   try to get their minds and bodies to obey the normal rules: speaking clearly, making sense, not falling over. And it?s precisely that extra focus that can give their game away. The more determined they are not to seem drunk, Mr. Roxburgh said, the more clearly drunk they will seem."
18341,Christopher Mele,14/02/2017,2017,2,science,"Picking the pain reliever that?s best for you can be a confusing task. Pharmacy and supermarket shelves are lined with a dizzying array of boxes, names and labels describing the symptoms the medications are intended to address. While they all share the same goal, making you feel better, their active ingredients vary, and all have potential drawbacks. Dr. Robert A. Duarte, director of the Pain Center at Northwell Health in Great Neck, N. Y. cautioned that consumers should not be lulled into thinking that    pain relievers are free from potential harm just because they are available on store shelves. Sales of    medications exceeded $30 billion in 2015, with pain relievers ranking near the top, according to industry statistics. Consumers need to be informed about what they are taking, and in what doses. A survey conducted in 2001 for the National Council on Patient Information and Education found that only   of those polled could identify the active ingredient in their pain reliever. A similar fraction of consumers said they had taken more than the recommended dose of nonprescription medication because they believed it would increase its effectiveness. Dr. Sadiah Siddiqui, an anesthesiologist specializing in interventional pain medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine in Manhattan, said consumers need to read the labels of the medications for their active ingredients. Those who take any kind of    pain reliever around the clock for a week or more should see a specialist or their doctor, she added. Here are the major categories of nonprescription pain relievers and some of what you should know about them: Common brand name: Tylenol Recommended to treat: Headaches, pain and fever Potential side effects:The Food and Drug Administration recommends a maximum of 4, 000 milligrams per day. Exceeding that level can mean the liver has to work harder. Clinicians recommend a daily maximum dose of 3, 000 if it is taken for an extended period. What else you should know: Concerns about potential liver damage from taking acetaminophen have been clouded over time, Dr. Duarte said. The warnings surfaced because patients were taking Tylenol with other    medications or prescriptions that also contained acetaminophen. For instance, the prescription painkiller Percocet and    cold and flu remedies have Tylenol in them. When patients take those drugs as well as Tylenol, they can unwittingly get higher doses of acetaminophen than they should, he said. ?You may not think you are taking that much Tylenol, but yes you are,? he said. Common brand names: Advil, Motrin Recommended to treat: Arthritic, joint and dental pain and headaches Potential side effects: Stomach bleeding and kidney problems are risks, particularly for patients who are 60 or older, Dr. Duarte said. What else you should know: Ibuprofen is an   that combats prostaglandins, the chemicals associated with pain such as menstrual cramps, joint pain and headaches that are released in the body. Common brand names: Bayer and St. Joseph. It is also found in Excedrin. Recommended to treat: Headaches and pain from inflammation. It is also used to prevent strokes and promote heart health. Potential side effects: Gastric bleeding and kidney dysfunction children up to their   years should not take aspirin because it is linked to Reye syndrome, which causes brain and liver damage. What else you should know: When it comes to Excedrin and Excedrin for migraines, opt for the less expensive basic product because they both have the same active ingredients, Dr. Duarte said, adding, ?Don?t be fooled by packaging. ? In general, he said, regardless of what product you take, don?t think that if some is good, more is better. If you have an underlying history of headaches and you are regularly taking    pain relievers, you can be at risk of a ?rebound headache? caused by the drugs wearing off and the onset of another headache. Some natural products, such as magnesium (400 to 600 milligrams a day) or riboflavin (400 milligrams a day) or using aromatherapy with peppermint oil can help with migraines and muscle pain, he said. Patients should discuss all the medications they take with their doctor. ?A simple    in fact, has risks just the way a prescription does,? Dr. Duarte said. ?A lot of the patients don?t take these medications seriously. ?"
18368,Anne Barnard,7/02/2017,2017,2,politics,"BEIRUT, Lebanon  ?   The Syrian government has executed 5, 000 to 13, 000 people in mass hangings in just one of its many prisons since the start of the    uprising against President Bashar   Amnesty International contends in a new report. The report on the Saydnaya military prison, which Amnesty said was based on interviews with former detainees there, prison employees, judges and others, accuses the Syrian government of systematically executing perceived opponents after sham trials that lasted just a few minutes. Inmates are kept under conditions so dismal  ?   including regular, severe beatings and deprivation of food, water, medicine and basic sanitation  ?   that they amount to deliberate extermination, defined under international law as a crime against humanity, the report said. While inhumane prison conditions in Syria have been known for decades, the Amnesty report laid out what it described as new details  ?   not documented by any human rights monitoring group to date  ?   about the scale of the killings and the state systems required to facilitate them, including approvals by   officials. ?We now know where, when and how often these hangings are taking place, as well as which elements of the Syrian government have authorized them,? said Nicolette Waldman, an Amnesty researcher specializing in detention issues and one of the report?s authors. Mr. Assad, in an interview with The New York Times and other journalists last year, insisted that detainees were being treated according to Syrian law and that their families could locate them by appealing to the judicial system. But the report corroborates numerous accounts given to The Times by current and former detainees in several prisons across Syria, detailing regular torture and deprivation. It also echoes reports from families of detainees that the government has refused to provide even basic information such as where they are and whether they are alive. According to former officials cited in the report, detainees  ?   most of them accused of nonviolent offenses, such as participating in demonstrations  ?   are tortured into giving confessions, then taken to   military field courts, where they undergo trials lasting two to three minutes. At regular intervals, the Amnesty report said, they are gathered in the middle of the night from their cells and taken blindfolded to an execution room on the grounds of the prison near Damascus, where they are hanged. Some prisoners have managed to stand on toilets to look out windows and see bodies carted away, and the number of slippers left lying on the ground. ?If there were 30 slippers, then we knew that 15 people had been executed,? Abu Osama, a former military officer detained in the prison, was quoted as saying. ?There were usually between 30 and 80 slippers outside. ?"
18448,David Zucchino,10/02/2017,2017,2,business,"Times journalists are in Iraq?s Sunni heartland to evaluate rebuilding efforts after battles with the Islamic State. FALLUJA, Iraq  ?   Iraqi forces had taken Falluja from the Islamic State months before, and Sabah Rashid was more than ready to return home. But the police warned him not to go. Fleeing Islamic State fighters had rigged bombs all through his south Falluja neighborhood, and these had still not been cleared, they told him. Insurgent corpses were said to lay unrecovered. Mr. Rashid, 30, a determined sort, moved back into his ransacked house anyway  ?   he and his family fled the Islamic State three years ago and did not want to wait. Last week, they were camped out in their sagging house with no heat, electricity or running water. They boiled water on a wood fire. And they waited with mounting frustration for promised government aid. Nearly eight months after the recapture of Falluja showed that Iraq?s government could wrest one of the Islamic State?s major support bases away from it, the victory now seems at risk. The   national government has not yet demonstrated that it can secure and rebuild this shattered Sunni city, soothe sectarian grievances or provide for 250, 000 returning residents. Iraqi and American security officials now fear that if the Sunnis of Falluja are given no reason to trust the government, they may once again embrace the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and ISIL. Local officials say Islamic State sleeper cells remain active, and many residents continue to aid the insurgents. Guerrilla attacks have resumed in one of the most recent episodes, a suicide car bomb on Jan. 28 killed two police officers. The seeds of an incomplete victory were there from the start. Falluja had long been disaffected from the government, and it was the first Iraqi city to fall under Islamic State control. Even with the group mostly driven out, the government faced a widespread lack of trust. Further, the battle relied heavily on Shiite militia forces, many of which are backed by Iran, and reports of sectarian abuses of the Sunni population started almost immediately. In one case, the governor of surrounding Anbar Province said that militia fighters and some of their allies in the security forces had summarily executed 49 Sunnis from Falluja and tortured others. The government tried to keep the militias out of Falluja to avoid antagonizing Sunni residents. But many entered the city dressed as policemen, Sunni lawmakers said. Local officials said Shiite militiamen were now confined to checkpoints on Falluja?s outskirts, about 40 miles west of Baghdad. ?Of course, violations occurred in some places,? by Shiite militiamen, said Salam Ajmi, a Falluja municipal councilman. But now, he said, some Sunni residents were cooperating with security forces to help root out Islamic State sleeper cells. A visit to Falluja by Times journalists showed that last summer?s battle had left some sections of the city relatively unscathed, but had reduced others to rubble. Many streets were littered with crumpled buildings, collapsed roofs and   cars, all coated with gray dust. The skeleton of a crushed Humvee lay near Mr. Rashid?s home. For Mr. Rashid, the satisfaction of returning home was dimmed by resentment toward local Sunni officials charged with rebuilding the city. ?We get nothing from them but promises  ?   we are on our own,? he said as his two young sons fed dry grass to the campfire. The family members survive on food purchased at a newly opened market in a nearby district. Their own Al Alamin neighborhood offered only a bleak panorama of   homes and deserted streets. ?Falluja has had some hard lessons  ?   we hope this will be our last hard lesson,? said Sheikh Talib   the head of Falluja?s local council, who has promised returnees that help is on the way. Mr. Efan spoke in a cold, darkened room, within a building he said had been used as an Islamic State headquarters and was now the council?s makeshift office. The electricity sputtered on and off. Mr. Efan is a returnee himself. His three homes  ?   one for each wife  ?   were destroyed during the Islamic State occupation, he said. He has lived at a friend?s house since returning in August. ?People have to expect delays,? he said. ?They need to be patient. ? The United Nations Development Program said it had made stopgap repairs to the city?s main teaching hospital and to five schools and health centers. The agency has restored rudimentary electricity and water in many areas, cleared debris and hired 300 locals to clean streets. Lise Grande, the United Nations deputy special representative in Iraq, said the agency?s stabilization work was to help patch up Falluja until more permanent repairs could be made. The agency has spent $8. 6 million of $18. 5 million allocated  ?   a small fraction of the amount needed to rebuild the city. Mr. Ajmi, the councilman, said the council had little funding. Depressed oil prices have kept Iraq?s economy floundering. Life is precarious everywhere, he said, not just in Falluja. Hussein Ahmed, 53, who lived in a   camp for three years, said he had lost patience with the council. He returned to Falluja to find his house wrecked  ?   the third he has lost. Two previous homes were destroyed during battles against fighters for Al Qaeda in Iraq, he said. ?We were hurt badly by Daesh,? he said, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State. ?And now we?re being hurt by our own government. ? Mr. Ahmed pointed to an expanse of toppled buildings: ?This area was liberated in June, and it still looks the same now. ? Other returning residents nodded as Mr. Ahmed added, ?I speak for thousands of people when I say the government has forgotten us. ? Falluja has endured tragedy on an epic scale since 2003. The city was pounded during repeated battles  ?   first between the United States and Saddam Hussein?s forces in 2003, then between American Marines and Al Qaeda fighters. Most insurgents were eventually evicted with the help of Sunni tribal fighters. But the insurgency was reborn as the Islamic State. It overran Falluja in December 2013, and the city became an important base for the group?s operations. One reason the government assaulted the city last May, even before turning to the critical campaign for Mosul, to the north, was to curb a devastating car bomb campaign against Baghdad that was being operated from Falluja. Now, the United States military is working with Iraqi forces to prevent Islamic State fighters from rising up in Falluja again, said a spokesman, Col. John L. Dorrian. ?They have proved very resilient,? he said. Falluja is hardly the government?s only worry in a nation with 3. 1 million internally displaced people. The government is pouring resources into the Mosul battle while also trying to rebuild Falluja and Ramadi, in Anbar Province, and to repair the city of Tikrit, farther north. Of the 320, 000 people who fled Falluja for aid camps, about 250, 000 have returned since   the United Nations said. They are desperate to live at home again, whatever the risk. In south Falluja, First Lt. Walid Mohammed of the police shook his head as Mr. Rashid and his children tended their campfire. ?We told them the risk is all theirs,? he said. ?They are responsible if anything happens, not us. ? Elisabeth Koek, of the Norwegian Refugee Council in Iraq, said about letting residents return to dangerous areas deprived of public services: ?This is incredibly worrying. ? Mr. Rashid said he returned even after a   killed a returnee in a supposedly cleared area nearby. After Mr. Rashid moved in, a woman was killed by an explosion on Jan. 31 as she was repairing her home in the same area, police said. Mr. Rashid said he was accustomed to danger. He lifted his shirt to reveal jagged, crimson scars on his belly from an Islamic State bomb that he said blew up the family car in late 2013. The blackened front seat lay in the front yard. A tall,   man suddenly appeared: Mohammed Saeed, 49, a neighbor whom Mr. Rashid had not seen since 2013. Mr. Saed had returned that morning, three years after fleeing. His home was dirty and bereft of electricity or water. But he was moving in. Mr. Saed kissed Mr. Rashid on both cheeks. ?I?m so happy,? he told him. ?It?s a dangerous, terrible place, but we are home. ?"

President Trump fired his acting attorney general on Monday night, removing her as the nation?s top law enforcement officer after she defiantly refused to defend his executive order closing the nation?s borders to refugees and people from predominantly Muslim countries. In an escalating crisis for his    administration, the president declared in a statement that Sally Q. Yates, who had served as deputy attorney general under President Barack Obama, had betrayed the administration by announcing that Justice Department lawyers would not defend Mr. Trump?s order against legal challenges. The president replaced Ms. Yates with Dana J. Boente, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, saying that he would serve as attorney general until Congress acts to confirm Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama. In his first act in his new role, Mr. Boente announced that he was rescinding Ms. Yates?s order. Monday?s events have transformed the confirmation of Mr. Sessions into a referendum on Mr. Trump?s immigration order. Action in the Senate could come as early as Tuesday. Ms. Yates?s order was a remarkable rebuke by a government official to a sitting president, and it recalled the   Saturday Night Massacre in 1973, when President Richard M. Nixon fired his attorney general and deputy attorney general for refusing to dismiss the special prosecutor in the Watergate case. Mr. Boente was sworn in at 9 p. m. according to White House officials, who did not provide details about who performed the ceremony. In a statement, Mr. Boente pledged to ?defend and enforce the laws of our country. ? At 9:15 p. m. Ms. Yates received a   letter at the Justice Department that informed her that she was fired. Signed by John DeStefano, one of Mr. Trump?s White House aides, the letter informed Ms. Yates that ?the president has removed you from the office of Deputy Attorney General of the United States. ? Two minutes later, the White House officials lashed out at Ms. Yates in a statement issued by Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary. ?Ms. Yates is an Obama administration appointee who is weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration,? the statement said. The firing of Ms. Yates came at the end of a turbulent three days that began on Friday with Mr. Trump?s signing of his executive order. The action stranded travelers around the world, led to protests around the country and created alarm inside the bureaucracy. Ms. Yates, like other senior government officials, was caught by surprise by the executive order and agonized over the weekend about how to respond, two Justice Department officials involved in the weekend deliberations said. Ms. Yates considered resigning but she told colleagues she did not want to leave it to her successor to face the same dilemma. By Monday afternoon, Ms. Yates added to a deepening sense of anxiety in the nation?s capital by publicly confronting the president with a stinging challenge to his authority, laying bare a deep divide at the Justice Department, within the diplomatic corps and elsewhere in the government over the wisdom of his order. ?At present, I am not convinced that the defense of the executive order is consistent with these responsibilities, nor am I convinced that the executive order is lawful,? Ms. Yates wrote in a letter to Justice Department lawyers. Mr. Trump?s senior aides huddled together in the West Wing to determine what to do. They decided quickly that her insubordination could not stand, according to an administration official familiar with the deliberations. Among the chief concerns was whether Mr. Sessions could be confirmed quickly by the Senate. After Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, received reassurances from Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, that the confirmation was on track, aides took their recommendation to Mr. Trump in the White House residence. The president decided quickly: She has to go, he told them. The official statement from Mr. Spicer accused Ms. Yates of failing to fulfill her duty to defend a ?legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States? that had been approved by the Justice Department?s Office of Legal Counsel. ?It is time to get serious about protecting our country,? Mr. Spicer said in the statement. He accused Democrats of holding up the confirmation of Mr. Sessions for political reasons. ?Calling for tougher vetting for individuals traveling from seven dangerous places is not extreme. It is reasonable and necessary to protect our country. ? Former Justice Department officials said the president?s action would send a deep shudder through an agency that was already on edge as officials anticipated an ideological overhaul once Mr. Sessions takes over. One former senior official said that department lawyers would be unnerved by the firing. Democrats, meanwhile, hailed Ms. Yates as a principled defender of what she thought was right. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said in a statement that the ?attorney general should be loyal and pledge fidelity to the law, not the White House. The fact that this administration doesn?t understand that is chilling. ? Mr. Boente has told the White House that he is willing to sign off on Mr. Trump?s executive order on refugees and immigration, according to Joshua Stueve, a spokesman for the United States attorney?s office in Alexandria, Va. where Mr. Boente has served as the top prosecutor since 2015. Mr. Boente, who has been a prosecutor with the Justice Department for 31 years, had no hesitation about accepting the acting attorney general?s job given his ?seniority and loyalty? to the department, Mr. Stueve said in a telephone interview on Monday night. As acting attorney general, Ms. Yates was the only person at the Justice Department authorized to sign applications for foreign surveillance warrants. Administrations of both parties have interpreted surveillance laws as requiring foreign surveillance warrants be signed only by   Justice Department officials. Mr. Boente was   as United States attorney and, though the situation is unprecedented, the White House said he was authorized to sign the warrants. Ms. Yates?s decision had effectively overruled a finding by the Justice Department?s Office of Legal Counsel, which had already approved the executive order ?with respect to form and legality. ? Ms. Yates said her determination in deciding not to defend the order was broader, however, and included questions not only about the order?s lawfulness, but also whether it was a ?wise or just? policy. She also alluded to unspecified statements the White House had made before signing the order, which she factored into her review. Mr. Trump initially responded to the letter with a post on Twitter at 7:45 p. m. complaining that the Senate?s delay in confirming his cabinet nominees had resulted in leaving Ms. Yates in place. The 1973 ?Saturday Night Massacre? led to a constitutional crisis that ended when Robert H. Bork, the solicitor general, acceded to Mr. Nixon?s order and fired Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor. Ms. Yates, a career prosecutor, is different because she is a holdover from the Obama administration. She agreed to Mr. Trump?s request to stay on as acting attorney general until Mr. Sessions is confirmed to be attorney general."
17748,Teresa Genaro,18/01/2017,2017,1,sports,"The winner of the feature race on Monday at Aqueduct, it was noted, ran    starting in front and ending that way as the race?s second wagering choice. And yet, despite the bettors? confidence, the outcome was extraordinarily unusual, and all but unnoticed. The winning owners are brothers who were born in Jamaica: Gaston and Anthony Grant. Gaston Grant served as the horse?s trainer  ?   a labor of love that he juggles with his   job as a driver for UPS. The rider, Kendrick Carmouche, was a jockey from Louisiana. All are black. On a rare Monday of live horse racing at Aqueduct, in South Ozone Park, Queens, the sight in the winner?s circle was rarer still, in a sport with few black participants and on a holiday card that coincided with Martin Luther King?s Birthday. The winner?s trophy for the race, the Toboggan Stakes, was even presented by Sentell Taylor Jr. a placing judge who has worked at New York tracks for more than 50 years Mr. Taylor is also black. ?After the race, I said, ?Would you look at this?? ? Mr. Taylor remarked. ?It all fell into place. I was surprised. ? Still, the significance and rarity of the moment seemed lost. It went unmentioned in various accounts of the race the New York Racing Association, which runs Aqueduct, did not note it on its social media accounts or in its news release. It even mostly escaped Gaston Grant, the owner and trainer of the winner, Green Gratto, a    thoroughbred. For Mr. Grant, who currently trains six horses, the import of the day was more in the victory than the holiday. ?I didn?t even really think about it until just now,? Mr. Grant said. Mr. Grant keeps his horses on the backstretch at Aqueduct, tending to them in the morning before heading off to his other day job delivering packages. He was introduced to the track by his father, but his involvement in the sport was confined to gambling until about 20 years ago, when he picked up work as a groom and a   a person who cools down a horse after a race. He finally obtained his trainer?s license two years ago. From 2005 to 2014, the feature race on this January holiday was the Jimmy Winkfield Stakes, named for the black jockey who won the Kentucky Derby in 1901 and 1902. Winkfield would go on to be an international star after racism in his native country forced him to pursue his career overseas. More than a century later, there are still few black jockeys at most American racetracks, and the Winkfield Stakes, which will take place next month, was never won by a black rider when it was held on the day honoring the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. ?Anytime something like this happens, and I?m involved, and my people are involved, it?s significant and I?m happy,? Mr. Taylor said of the victory for Green Gratto?s connections. Indeed, the outcome of the Toboggan Stakes  ?   first run in New York in 1893, and the replacement for the Winkfield Stakes  ?   created an unexpected commemoration of the holiday. ?It seems like it was bound for us to win that race,? Mr. Carmouche said. ?My birthday is Wednesday and it always falls near Martin Luther King Day, and it seems like everything I do this week is for him. ? The son and grandson of jockeys, Mr. Carmouche remembers being placed onto a horse for the first time when he was 7 or 8 years old. By the time he was 16, he had gotten his jockey?s license. His first win came in 2000 for Shelton Zenon, a black trainer, on a horse called Earl N Erin at Evangeline Downs in Louisiana. But since he left that state, where black jockeys and trainers are more common than they are at Northern tracks, his mounts for black trainers have been less frequent. ?There are very few,? Mr. Carmouche said. ?To be honest, I think that black families don?t bring their kids around the racetrack as much. You have to really love horses and to be around them for a long time, to not feel afraid of them to ride them. ? After leaving Louisiana, Mr. Carmouche rode at tracks in Texas and the   before making the move to New York to try to make an impact in one of the toughest jockey colonies in the country. He will be 33 on Wednesday, and is in second place in the jockey standings for the current Aqueduct meeting. ?I have a dream, to become a top rider,? he said, deliberately invoking Dr. King. ?From the day I was born until now, and I?m living my dream. ?"
17460,Emily Palmer and John Otis,8/01/2017,2017,1,lifestyle,"She skipped almost every class her sophomore year and still maintained perfect attendance. The trick was to drop in for the start of third period, wait for attendance to be recorded for the day and then leave with a bathroom pass. By the time her mother found out about the scheme, Skylynn Vazquez was failing every subject. Most days, Saquan Bright did not bother to show up at Boys and Girls High School in   Brooklyn. He chose to roam the streets with his friends. But then Ms. Vazquez and Mr. Bright found a school designed for students like them: Brooklyn High School for Leadership and Community Service in Clinton Hill, which is operated by Brooklyn Community Services, one of eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Leadership, one of 57 transfer schools in New York City  ?   established to help students struggling in traditional schools  ?   has 202 students ages 16 to 21. By the time students reach Leadership, they have either dropped out of their regular schools or neared that point because of low grades or poor attendance. Many come from unstable homes, living with single parents in shelters and temporary housing, and have spent time in the criminal justice system. And 82 percent of the students qualify for free lunch because of their family?s income. The flexible school schedule  ?   which allows for free periods  ?   enables students to concentrate on courses required to graduate. And the school provides an optional paid internship program, which is appealing to students, some of whom help support their families or who are legally emancipated and support themselves. Before Leadership, Mr. Bright could not keep up with the demands at Boys and Girls High School. He struggled to pay attention in class, and could not finish tests in time. Still, he was not tested for a learning disability until he was enrolled at Leadership. Now he receives services at Leadership and extended time for tests, and his grades have improved. At her previous school, in Bushwick, Ms. Vazquez purposefully broke the rules. She wore hats at school every day, even though they were forbidden, and each one was taken away. ?There was a point where I didn?t have any of my hats,? she said. ?All 30 of my hats were locked in the dean?s office. ? She enrolled at that school midway through her freshman year, after moving from Florida. She recalled skipping classes and darting off to play basketball and video games with a handful of friends, most of whom have since dropped out, she said. ?We were a bad influence on each other,? she said. ?If one of us wasn?t in the mood to go to class, we?d all leave. We pushed each other to do the wrong thing. ? In March 2014, Ms. Vazquez?s mother  ?   enraged by the discovery of what her daughter had been doing  ?   spoke with administrators at the school, who suggested that her daughter enroll at Leadership. Ms. Vasquez, nervous about again switching schools, did not want to go, but when she arrived, she immediately found a support system there. Classes were small, with 20 to 25 students, allowing a nurturing,   learning environment. Students are on a   basis with all the teachers, including the principal. ?Respect can be calling someone by their last name, but sometimes when you call someone by their first name, you feel like maybe you?re on a different level,? Stacey Fischler, the school?s program director, said. Students have access to advocate counselors, who are similar to social workers and help them with issues beyond academics, sometimes referring them to mental health services or youth shelters. Each counselor, assigned to 40 to 50 students, is tasked  ?   to the point of pestering  ?   with making sure they all go to school. ?My priority is to make sure you get your education,? said Heather Hansen, a counselor. ?Whether that is going to your house and knocking down your door or calling you like a lunatic all day or bothering your parents. That?s my goal. ? Ms. Vazquez smiled as she scrolled through those daily morning texts. At 6:25 a. m. on Nov. 2: ?Rise  Shine Scholars. The grind continues. ? Two days later, at 6:44 a. m.: ?Rise  Shine #TGIF. ? ?I don?t think they sleep,? Ms. Vazquez said, laughing. ?It?s a very supportive school. ? More than 14, 000 students attended transfer schools in New York City as of the   school year, the latest for which the Department of Education provided data.   graduation rates for the schools are much lower than the overall rate for New York City public schools, which increased in recent years to 70. 5 percent in 2015. Although the class of 2015 at Leadership had a 5. 6 percent   graduation rate, that rate improves over additional years  ?   typical of many transfer schools. About a quarter of students graduate within six years, according to Department of Education data. Despite lower rates, the schools are serving students who may have otherwise dropped out, never receiving a diploma. ?You?re working with a population that can be changed, that does need help and doesn?t get targeted often,? Ms. Hansen said. ?You?re working with a population that is getting a second chance. And it?s nice to be able to give that. At the end of the day, it can be frustrating and taxing, but you get to see them walk across the stage, and that?s the main goal. ? For Mr. Bright, graduation day seemed unlikely two years ago. In spring 2014, he fell behind again, started ditching classes and almost dropped out. That August, when he was standing on a street corner in   a car passed by. Shots rang out, hitting him in the abdomen. Members of his family and of the Leadership staff surrounded his hospital bed. ?There?s a lot of love there,? he said. He returned to school with renewed commitment. The Leadership family also kept Ms. Vazquez in school. ?I have good friends and a good support system when I get to school every morning,? she said. ?I didn?t think I?d get this far. But now I see a difference in myself, in how I react and how I say and do things. I?ve become a totally different person, and a lot of it comes from this school. ? Both Mr. Bright and Ms. Vazquez are looking forward to graduation. Mr. Bright, who will turn 22 this month, is allowed to finish this school year before he ages out of the public school system. He needs to pass one more Regents exam, for algebra, his most dreaded subject. So Brooklyn Community Services has allocated $500 in Neediest Cases funds to provide him with    tutoring. More than   of Leadership students, including Mr. Bright and Ms. Vazquez, participate in an     program. They have paid internships at places including Burlington Coat Factory, child care centers and the Brooklyn Veterinary Group. Last semester, Ms. Vazquez, 20, received an internship at 3 Black Cats Caf? and Cakery in Brooklyn, where she worked in the kitchen. It was the first job, Ms. Vazquez said, that she took pride in. ?To bake something from scratch and perfect it,? she said. ?Knowing that it represents your work, that is new for me. ? The internship ended in November, but she hopes to work at another restaurant. Her love for cooking started in her grandmother?s kitchen. They followed traditional Puerto Rican recipes, including pasteles, a dish of plantains, meat and olives. Now she cooks to remember her grandmother, who died last spring. After graduation in March, she hopes to continue her passion and has applied to culinary schools in upstate New York. When she talked to her grandmother about graduation, her grandmother would say, ?Vamos a ver?  ?   she would believe it when she saw it. ?And now she?ll see,? Ms. Vazquez said with a smile."
17953,Jonathan Soble,25/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"TOKYO  ?   President Trump?s decision to pull the United States out of the   Partnership trade deal should have been good news for Hitoshi Kondo, a Japanese rice farmer. The sweeping   agreement, negotiated by the Obama administration and formally rejected by Mr. Trump on Monday, would have opened swaths of Japan?s highly protected agricultural sector, and was bitterly opposed by farmers. Now, without American involvement, the deal looks as good as dead. Mr. Kondo isn?t celebrating, though. ?It?s actually scarier, because what comes next will be a lot harsher,? he said on Wednesday, as Japanese leaders scrambled to find a coherent response. What comes next, many in Japan believe, could be a bruising showdown between Tokyo and Washington. They fear a return to the trade wars of the 1980s and early ?90s, when many Americans saw Japan as an untrustworthy economic adversary. The   is a setback for Japan?s prime minister, Shinzo Abe. Mr. Abe viewed the   Partnership as a way to advance two cherished goals: drawing the United States closer to Japan and other friendly Pacific Rim countries (the trade deal, known as TPP, does not include China, the region?s increasingly bristly superpower) and bolstering Japan?s lackluster economy. Such is Mr. Abe?s enthusiasm for the deal that his government finished ratifying it on Friday, just before Mr. Trump?s inauguration, despite Mr. Trump?s promise to withdraw. Mr. Trump has repeatedly said he wants to alter the American trade relationship with Japan, in which Japan sells far more goods to the United States than it buys in return. In a meeting with executives from Ford Motor and other American manufacturers this week, the president again said that such an imbalance was ?not fair. ? And Mr. Trump says he wants to pursue trade agreements with individual nations, in lieu of group deals like TPP, which would have included countries comprising as much as 40 percent of the world?s economic output. Japan has long preferred multilateral   to    deals, but pressure to go along with Mr. Trump?s approach will be strong. ?Japan may eventually agree to bilaterals with the U. S. to ensure that the U. S. stays engaged in Asia  ?   both economically and to provide a security counter to China,? said Glen S. Fukushima, a former United States trade official who is now a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a think tank in Washington. Officially, Japan has not given up on the TPP, or on keeping the United States involved. The day after Mr. Trump signed his executive order committing to withdrawal, Mr. Abe said in Parliament he would ?resolutely continue to seek understanding? from Washington of the deal?s strategic and economic importance. Mr. Abe?s advisers express hope that members of Mr. Trump?s cabinet with business and national security experience will lend their voices to the effort. Sadayuki Sakakibara, chairman of Keidanren, the lobbying group representing Japan?s largest corporations, encouraged Mr. Abe this week to take a   approach. Mr. Abe, he said, should try to keep the deal alive while engaging the United States directly, if necessary, ?with the goal of eventually broadening negotiations to a multilateral level. ? Barring a drastic change in Mr. Trump?s views on trade, however, that could mean stringing matters out for years  ?   possibly until the next administration, if not longer. The TPP?s demise doesn?t pose an immediate threat to Mr. Abe, whose poll numbers remain high. About as many Japanese voters favored the trade deal as opposed it. But none of Japan?s other trade options serve Mr. Abe?s goals the way TPP does. Japan and others could move on without Washington, which would require changing a condition that requires the United States to ratify the deal before it can take effect. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia said on Tuesday that he had been promoting that idea to Mr. Abe and several other leaders. Japan, with the   economy in the group, after the United States, would be a crucial participant. But it could be politically awkward for Mr. Abe, who sold the deal on the merits of American involvement. Even on narrow commercial grounds, he would have some explaining to do: Accepting more agricultural imports was supposed to be the price Japan paid for cheaper access to the vast United States market for cars and other manufactured goods. With the United States out of the picture, Mr. Abe could be accused of selling out farmers for little gain. Japan is negotiating other deals. One, with the European Union, predates Mr. Abe?s embrace of the TPP, in 2013, but talks had been put on hold. European negotiators want concessions on agriculture, too  ?   another reason Japanese farmers are not breathing sighs of relief. In at least one area, dairy products, European demands go beyond what Japan agreed to in the TPP. Japan is also part of an Asian trade initiative, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. But that effort is being led by China, which has that partnership?s largest economy. China?s rise represents perhaps the biggest change from the United   trade battles of a generation ago. For Japan, it is both an added risk and a potential buffer. Many in the Abe administration hope that Mr. Trump will target China first, making Japan a lower priority, said a senior government official involved in trade matters, who asked for anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue. Companies, however, are dusting off their 1980s playbooks. Japanese carmakers built factories in the United States to head off American protectionism then  ?   investments that Akio Toyoda, president of Toyota Motor, and others have made a recent point of highlighting. Only about a quarter of the   cars sold in the United States are imported, though Japan remains the source for many   components as well as design work. One of Mr. Trump?s complaints about Japan, repeated for decades by American trade negotiators, is that its economy is organized to keep foreign products out even without overt trade barriers like tariffs. By this logic, American carmakers have failed to penetrate the Japanese market because dealers and regulators collude against them. (Japan imposes no border taxes on cars the United States adds a 2. 5 percent levy to most imported Japanese vehicles.) Japan has been addressing     barriers  ?   in some cases as a direct response to the TPP talks. It agreed during the negotiations to recognize some American automobile safety standards, for instance, and has narrowed a tax loophole that favors ultralight Japanese cars. In agriculture, Mr. Abe has moved to curb the power of Japan?s monopolistic farm cooperatives. Under TPP, Japan agreed to phase out import duties on about 2, 000 agricultural products, more than in any previous trade deal, but a smaller percentage of the total than other signatories. Sensitive products like rice were exempted. Mr. Kondo, the rice farmer, worries that Mr. Abe will concede more ground to the United States in order to appease Mr. Trump. ?We have to sell cars to the U. S.,? he said, ?and farmers will be traded away for access. ?"
17762,Peter S. Goodman,19/01/2017,2017,1,business,"DAVOS, Switzerland  ?   You have perhaps noticed that in many countries,   numbers of people have grown enraged at the economic elite and their tendency to hog the spoils of globalization. This wave of anger has delivered Donald J. Trump to the White House, sent Britain toward the exit of the European Union, and threatened the future of global trade. The people gathered here this week in the Swiss Alps for the annual World Economic Forum have noticed this, too. They are the elite  ?   heads of state, billionaire hedge fund managers, technology executives. They are eager to talk about how to set things right, soothing the populist fury by making globalization a more lucrative proposition for the masses. Myriad panel discussions are focused on finding the best way to ?reform capitalism,? make globalization work and revive the middle class. What is striking is what generally is not discussed: bolstering the power of workers to bargain for better wages and redistributing wealth from the top to the bottom. ?That agenda is anathema to a lot of Davos men and women,? said Joseph E. Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate economist and author of numerous books on globalization and economic inequality. ?More rights to bargain for workers, that?s the part where Davos man is going to get stuck. The stark reality is that globalization has reduced the bargaining power of workers, and corporations have taken advantage of it. ? Davos is  ?   at least rhetorically  ?   consumed with worries about the shortcomings of globalization. About the deepening anxieties of the middle class in many developed economies. About the threat of trade protectionism and its attendant hit to economic growth. About the fear that robots are on the verge of sowing mass unemployment. It is a conversation fueled in part by fear: If the world is indeed in the throes of a populist insurrection, the pitchforks could do worse than to point here. The Davos elites have enjoyed outsize influence over economic policies in recent decades as a growing share of wealth has, perhaps not coincidentally, landed in the coffers of people with a need for bank accounts in the British Virgin Islands, while poor and   households have seen their earnings stagnate and decline. Yet the solutions that have currency seem calculated to spare corporations and the wealthiest people from having to make any sacrifices at all, as if there is a way to be found to tilt the balance of inequality while those at the top hang on to everything they have. More entrepreneurialism, mindfulness training, education focused on the modern ways of technology: These are the sorts of items that tend to get discussed here as the response to the plight of those left behind by globalization. That perhaps private equity overseers should not be paid 1, 000 times as much as teachers while availing themselves of tax breaks is thinking that gets little airing here. At a dinner on Monday evening as the forum got underway, Ian Goldin, a professor of globalization and development at Oxford University, celebrated the connectedness of the global economy and the technological advancements that have liberated humans from disease, poverty and the drudgery of manual labor. ?There?s never been a better time to be alive, and yet we feel so glum,? Mr. Goldin said. ?So many people feel anxious. So many people feel that this is one of the most dangerous times. ? He denounced the frightened retreat from globalization manifest in Mr. Trump?s threats of a trade war with China, and in Britain?s abandonment of Europe, commonly known as Brexit. ?You can?t stop managing an entangled environment by disconnecting,? he said. ?This is the fundamental mistake of Brexit, of Trump, and of so many others. We are not simply connected. We are entangled. Our lives, our destinies are intertwined. What happens in China, what happens in Indonesia, what happens in India, what happens across Europe, and what happens in North America, across Africa and Latin America will affect all of us in dramatic new ways. The idea that somehow we can forge our future in an insular way, even for the biggest countries like the U. S. is a fantasy. ? And yet, Mr. Goldin said, if the benefits of globalization are not spread more equitably, the world could be in for a replay of the Renaissance, an extraordinary period of scientific progress, commercial growth and artistic creativity in Europe that ultimately yielded popular resentment. The gold leaf landing on cathedrals was not bettering the lot of the peasantry. The spices coming in from Asia were too expensive for most. The Medici family that ruled Florence was sent packing by the mob. Intellectuals were persecuted and books burned. ?We need to learn these historical lessons and realize that this is the most precious moment in human history,? Mr. Goldin said. ?We need to make the choices to ensure that globalization is sustainable, that connectivity is sustainable, that we deal with the intractable problems that are worrying people. ? But Mr. Goldin?s comments were merely the prelude to a conversation that was supposed to be about how to pull that off. The answers from the corporate executives who comprised a panel could be crudely boiled down to this: The people who have not benefited from globalization need to try harder to emulate those who have succeeded. Abidali Neemuchwala, the chief executive officer of Wipro, the global information technology and consulting company that hosted the event along with The Financial Times  ?   and who last year earned some $1. 8 million plus stock grants worth an additional $2 million or so  ?   said working people would have to pursue training for the jobs of the future. ?People have to take more ownership of upgrading themselves on a continuous basis,? he said. No one can reasonably argue against the merits of training (or entrepreneurialism for that matter). The jobs of the future have not yet been invented. New skills will be required to seize them. But nowhere in the discussion was there a mention of tax policy, or addressing the soaring costs of gaining higher education, or access to health care. At a panel on Wednesday morning, Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, injected a rarely heard word into a conversation about the crisis for   households: redistribution. ?There are things that can be done,? she said. ?It probably means more redistribution than we have at the moment. ? But then the conversation moved on to other subjects. Ray Dalio, founder of the American investment firm Bridgewater Associates  ?   who took home $1. 4 billion in compensation in 2015  ?   suggested the key to reinvigorating the middle class was to ?create a favorable environment for making money. ? He touted in particular the ?animal spirits? unleashed by stripping away regulations. For years, economic inequality has ranked as one of the most discussed issues at Davos, both in the formal conference agenda and in the conversations that fill hallways and the private parties and dinners held throughout town. For years, little to nothing has changed. ?People talk about inequality, how it?s a major problem, the greatest threat to globalization and the global economy,? Mr. Stiglitz said. ?You have to recognize that the way we have managed globalization has contributed significantly to inequality. But I have not yet heard a good conversation about what changes in globalization would address inequality. ? That is not an accident, he surmised. Any sincere list would have to include items that involve transferring wealth and power from the sorts of people who come to Davos to ordinary workers via more progressive taxation, increased bargaining rights for labor unions, and greater protections for labor in general. Same as every other year, Davos is again plastered with the slogan of the World Economic Forum: ?Committed to Improving the State of the World. ? But whatever improvements are supposed to be made, one can safely assume they will not conflict with those in attendance continuing to enjoy the state of the world as it is now, with canap?s and aged Bordeaux and private jets at the ready. Which means that the global populism insurrection is unlikely to lose momentum anytime soon."
17481,Michael Wilson,10/01/2017,2017,1,business,"They read like descriptions of props from the script of a Hollywood heist caper, with promises to ward off ?attacks? on all six sides from the usual suspects: hammer, crowbar, drill, blowtorch, nitroglycerin. That is the language of the brochures and websites of the city?s safe dealers, a small but longstanding industry that manages fears in and around the diamond district not only of disasters like fires or explosions, but also of hypothetical supervillains. When a safe is breached, word travels quickly. What happened? Whose safe was it? How did they get in? Those were the sorts of questions raised last week after a team of burglars broke into a jeweler?s office on West 36th Street on New Year?s Eve. The crime was widely reported for its scope  ?   the thieves made off with $6 million in diamonds and other gems  ?   and its brazen timing, occurring as the ball dropped six blocks away in a neighborhood teeming with police officers. Surveillance video showing two people hitting a   door with hammers was taken immediately after midnight, the police said, when the sound of cheers would have most likely drowned out any banging. But what happened next is, to many in the safe industry, more important than the forced entry. The two safes that held the valuables, the police said, showed no sign of forced entry. The police have not provided further details on the safes. News reports have suggested investigators are looking into whether someone working for the dealer who provided the safes gave the thieves the combinations. A man answering the telephone at the office of the dealer, Lacka Safe in New Jersey, said on Friday that the owners declined to comment. As that investigation unfolds, the burglary  ?   or ?attack,? in   security parlance  ?   draws attention to the last line of defense for the city?s many jewelers, an object that, for all the advances in technology over the years, remains a box with three sides, a top, a bottom and a door.   safes evoke exciting scenes from the movies, with steely safecrackers listening for clicks or drilling into dense steel with lasers. In reality, though, making safes is a hushed trade built on discretion and trust. ?I get calls all the time, ?Are your people O. K.??? said Richard Krasilovsky of Empire Safe in Midtown. ?How safe is it  ?   all puns intended  ?   for your people to do the work? The people know where the safe is going. I say it?s a legitimate question to ask. ? Dealers carry an array of safes and locks, including digital locks with keypads and time locks that prevent anyone from opening the door, with or without the combination, while they?re activated. The jewelers of Manhattan historically prefer more traditional designs for their safes, dealers said last week, with mechanical combination locks. ?It?s an older industry,? said Dov Israeli of Precision Lock and Safe in Floral Park, N. Y. ?They?re focused on price and less on what?s new. ? A jeweler typically requires a certain level of protection to satisfy its insurance company. These levels shown in ratings by Underwriters Laboratories, such as   or   indicate that safecrackers at the lab, using tools and torches, were unable to breach any of the six sides of the safe in 60 or 30 minutes. That is probably a greater margin of safety than the standard jeweler needs. ?  point nine nine nine percent of burglars out there can?t penetrate a properly made ? Mr. Krasilovsky said. A brochure for a line of safes at Empire states that they are made of ?  and   armor? for ?greater protection against attack,? and that they protect against everything from ?hammers and simple drills, to thermal and electrical equipment, such as oxyacetylene torches and disk cutters. ? Mr. Krasilovsky said he met potential clients to offer a risk assessment based on what they were protecting and other factors, looking for what he called ?an Achilles? heel. ? ?It?s very easy to sell somebody protection, which is a safe,? he said. ?I try to sell prevention. Protection is a science. I don?t want the schmucks coming onto the premises. ? A cheaper safe may meet the requirements of an insurance company, while appearing to a burglar to be vulnerable. A technician sets the combination for a safe?s lock for the first time. ?We have you write it on a piece of paper,? and hand it to the technician, Mr. Israeli said. Some dealers may keep a copy for a period of time, in case the safe?s owner should need it. ?We tear it up  ?   we won?t keep a combination for you,? he said. ?It?s not even a service we will provide. ?"
18312,Charles V. Bagli,6/02/2017,2017,2,law,"Mary McCormack Hughes has a vivid recollection of the phone call she got 35 years ago this week from Robert Durst, her   . ?Have you seen Kathie?? he asked. Kathie was Kathleen Durst, Ms. Hughes?s younger sister, who at 29 was in the final months of medical school. Her marriage to Mr. Durst, the eccentric scion of a prominent New York real estate family, had splintered under Mr. Durst?s efforts to control her, repeated rounds of quarreling and, finally, violence. No, Ms. Hughes, said she had responded, but I?ve been meaning to talk to you about Kathie. Mr. Durst cut her off, saying he was going to the police, and abruptly ended the call, she said. Ms. Hughes remembers that as she hung up the phone in her East Side apartment that February evening in 1982, she turned to her husband, Tom Hughes, and said, ?I think he killed her. ? Today, Mr. Durst, 73, sits in Los Angeles County Jail awaiting trial on a charge of murder  ?   not of Kathie, but of Susan Berman, a confidante who, investigators say, knew his secrets and shielded him from newspaper reporters after his wife vanished. John Lewin, a deputy district attorney in Los Angeles, claims that Mr. Durst shot Ms. Berman in the back of her head at her Los Angeles home in December 2000, fearing that she would cooperate with a newly revived investigation into Ms. Durst?s disappearance. Mr. Durst was never charged with his wife?s killing, nor was anyone else. (Ms. Durst?s body has never been recovered.) He and his battery of lawyers have insisted that he did not kill Ms. Berman and does not know what happened to his first wife. Ms. Hughes has not paid much attention to events in Los Angeles. ?I think it?s going to be a disaster,? she said, with bitterness, of the coming trial during her first interview in more than three decades, at an Upper East Side apartment building where her sister once lived with Mr. Durst. A large photograph of Kathie Durst dressed in an Annie   dress and a   hat from the Wild West hung over the fireplace. ?Hollywood and publicity,? Ms. Hughes said. ?They?re not really interested in my sister  ?   they?re interested in Bob. I just want to find out what happened to my sister. ? The obsession nearly destroyed her. Kathie was the youngest daughter and the fifth child of a telephone company representative, who died in 1966, and a working mother. After graduating from high school in New Hyde Park on Long Island, Kathie trained as a dental hygienist and moved to a building owned by the Durst family on the East Side of Manhattan. Mr. Durst oversaw the building and when the two met, there was an instant attraction. ?It was a mutual attraction, a chemistry,? Ms. Hughes recalled. ?He had a magnetism. Kathie had the same thing. ? The Hugheses liked Mr. Durst when he started dating Kathie, then 19, in early 1971. He was nine years older and from another world. His father, Seymour Durst, presided over a Manhattan real estate company whose towers formed the skyline. The Dursts were low key, not the stereotypical    developers. For a while, Ms. Hughes said, her sister was unaware just how wealthy the Durst family was. After their second date, Mr. Durst asked Kathie to move with him to Vermont to run a health food store. But after a short time in Vermont, the couple returned to New York, and Mr. Durst resumed working at the family real estate business. They were married in a private ceremony on his birthday, April 12, in 1973. The couple partied at Studio 54, the   disco that was a haunt for celebrities and others. They sailed on the Mediterranean Sea and traveled to Thailand. Bob and Kathie socialized with Mary and Tom, even buying a racehorse together from a friend who was a breeder. ?He heard it was a tax deduction,? Tom Hughes said. ?I think he liked that part of it. ? But the Dursts? relationship took a dark turn after 1976, when Mr. Durst forced his wife to have an abortion. He didn?t want children she did. ?That?s when it went south,? Mr. Hughes said. Ms. Durst sought independence, enrolling in nursing school in Danbury, Conn. The couple bought a cottage nearby, on Lake Truesdale in South Salem, N. Y. in northern Westchester County, but also had a   on Riverside Drive in Manhattan and rented an apartment on the East Side. After graduating from nursing school, Ms. Durst immediately started medical school at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, hoping to become a pediatrician. ?She was excited to be a medical student,? recalled a classmate, Dr. Alicia  . ?She worked hard. She always took a seat in the front row and took notes. ? By 1980, the couple quarreled frequently, Ms. Hughes said, adding that her sister often called her with accounts of their latest fight. Ms. Durst contacted a divorce lawyer. She gathered damaging material about her husband and the Durst family, she told friends and her sister. Mr. Durst has long acknowledged his marijuana use, and his wife used cocaine, according to friends and members of her family. Both had affairs, his and her friends and relatives say. Mr. Durst, they say, cut off her credit cards to keep her close. ?Bob?s possessiveness was escalating into physical violence,? said a nursing school classmate of Ms. Durst?s, Eleanor Joy Schwank, during an interview in 2000. ?I never witnessed it, but Kathie would call me saying, ?Bobby is really violent. ?? Mr. Durst, impatient to leave a McCormack family gathering, yanked his wife?s hair, shocking her family, Ms. Hughes said. On another occasion, he stormed into their East Side apartment, where Ms. Durst was talking with friends, and kicked an acquaintance in the face. The man later settled a lawsuit over the episode with Mr. Durst. Three weeks before Ms. Durst disappeared, she was treated at Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx for bruises she suffered during an argument with her husband, according to several friends and medical records later recovered by investigators. Ms. Durst told her sister, her friends and virtually anyone who would listen, ?If anything happens to me, don?t let Bob get away with it. ? Geraldine McInerney, a friend of Ms. Hughes?s, said she had met Ms. Durst at the couple?s East Side apartment on Jan. 29, 1982. Ms. Durst wanted someone she knew to sublet the apartment so that if ?the situation between her and Durst became too threatening, she would have an alternative place to stay,? Ms. McInerney said in a 1983 affidavit. It was the last time Ms. McInerney saw her. A week later, Mr. Durst walked into a Manhattan police station to file a missing person?s report. He carried a copy of New York magazine with his father?s picture and the headline ?The Men Who Own New York. ? Mr. Durst told the police that he had put his wife on a train to Manhattan from Westchester County on Sunday night so that she could attend school the next day. He said he had later spoken to her by phone, after she arrived at their Riverside Drive  . Soon, the story was splashed across New York?s tabloids. Mr. Durst, who hired detectives and offered a reward, told his family, friends and the police that his wife might have run away with a drug dealer. Her family found that implausible, since she was only months away from graduating. ?She always wanted to take care of children,? Mr. Hughes said. Decades later, in an interview with the producers of the   HBO documentary ?The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst,? Mr. Durst acknowledged that much of what he had told the police was a lie. Why did he lie? ?I wanted them to leave me alone,? he explained to Mr. Lewin, the Los Angeles prosecutor, during an interrogation after his 2015 arrest in New Orleans on gun charges. ?I wasn?t used to somebody questioning my veracity. ? Frustrated by what they regarded as a desultory investigation by New York City detectives, Ms. Hughes and a small band of friends became amateur sleuths, tracking sightings of her sister and Mr. Durst and scouring phone records. By March 1982, they were making furtive   visits to what they believed was the scene of the crime, the stone cottage at the edge of Lake Truesdale. On one trip, Mr. Hughes found an ominous list in Mr. Durst?s handwriting in a garbage can: ?town dump, bridge, dig, boat? and ?shovel. ? They found Ms. Durst?s diamond earrings in her drawer at the Riverside Drive apartment, which Mr. Durst had told the police she was wearing when she disappeared. To this day, Ms. Hughes is shocked that New York City detectives never searched the cottage. Ms. Hughes and Ms. McInerney pored over pages and pages of phone records from the cottage, the apartments and the Durst Organization that they had gotten from the detectives. Night after night, the two women matched the phone numbers to names until they discovered that Mr. Durst had made collect calls to his family?s business from Ship Bottom, N. J. shortly after his wife vanished. The calls, coupled with the list of words, led them to suspect that Ms. Durst might be buried somewhere in the nearby Pine Barrens of New Jersey. Ms. Hughes and Ms. McInerney borrowed a car and drove the investigating detectives down to Ship Bottom. But the detectives seemed uninterested, Ms. Hughes said, and the case was no longer generating headlines. Mr. Durst was not charged with any crime. Ms. Hughes and her family wrestled with Mr. Durst in Surrogate?s Court for control of Ms. Durst?s estate, but suffered another defeat in 1983. ?I was just so fed up,? Ms. Hughes said. ?I broke down. I couldn?t do it anymore. ? For a long time, she refused to drive a car or even leave her apartment. She focused on her two daughters, whom she had long neglected. In the end, Ms. Hughes was left without answers as to her sister?s fate. But she never lost her conviction about Mr. Durst?s culpability. Ms. Hughes, her husband and Ms. McInerney cooperated with an investigation into Ms. Durst?s disappearance that was started in 2000 by an enterprising State Police investigator, Joe Becerra, only to be disappointed again when the local district attorney did not indict Mr. Durst. In recent years, Ms. Hughes and other members of her family have gone back to Surrogate?s Court to fight Mr. Durst and to have her sister declared dead as of Jan. 31, 1982. Their mother, Ann McCormack, died in May at 102, without knowing what happened to Kathie. ?It?s absurd that after 35 years New York has not charged him with murder,? Robert Abrams, whose law firm, Abrams Fensterman, is representing Ms. Durst?s family, said of Mr. Durst. ?If they?re not going to do it criminally, we?ll do it civilly. ? Whatever happens in Los Angeles, Mr. Durst will return to federal prison to serve the remaining time on a   gun conviction. ?We want some sort of peace, some answers as to where she?s at,? Ms. Hughes said. ?Why couldn?t he just tell us? He has nothing to lose. He?s going to stay in jail. ?"
17628,Erin McCann,14/01/2017,2017,1,business,"The United States Mint will release a commemorative gold coin in April that will feature Lady Liberty as a black woman, marking the first time that she has been depicted as anything other than white on the nation?s currency. The coin, with a $100 face value, will commemorate the 225th anniversary of the Mint?s coin production, the Mint and the Treasury Department announced on Thursday. Going on sale April 6, it will be 24 karats and weigh about an ounce. It is part of a series of commemorative coins that will be released every two years. Future ones will show Lady Liberty as Asian, Hispanic and Indian ?to reflect the cultural and ethnic diversity of the United States,? the Mint said in a statement. The announcement comes at a pivotal cultural moment for the United States, a week away from a transfer of power, following a bruising election dominated by debates about immigration, race and political correctness. And Lady Liberty is among the most potent of American symbols. Her   depiction, a gift from France in 1886, stands in New York Harbor, a giant statue of a woman with white European features beckoning with a lamp to the refugees of the world. ?Part of our intent was to honor our tradition and heritage,? Rhett Jeppson, the principal deputy director of the Mint, said in a phone interview on Friday. ?But we also think it?s always worthwhile to have a conversation about liberty, and we certainly have started that conversation. ? Do not expect to see anyone spending the coins at the store. Coins like this do not circulate for everyday use, but are minted for collectors in limited quantities. There will be 100, 000 of them with the black Lady Liberty. They will sell for far more than face value, depending on the value of gold, currently more than $1, 000 an ounce. ?As we as a nation continue to evolve, so does Liberty?s representation,? Elisa Basnight, the chief of staff at the Mint, said at a presentation on Thursday in Washington. The coin?s head (what the Mint calls the obverse) was designed by Justin Kunz and engraved by Phebe Hemphill, and it shows a profile of Lady Liberty with a crown of stars that holds back her hair. The tail (the reverse, in Mint lingo) shows an eagle in flight. Mr. Jeppson said that several women had approached him after seeing the coin and told him, ?she looks like me when I was younger. ? ?I saw real value in that,? he said. ?That we see ourselves in the images in our coins. ? The Mint is expecting the coin to sell well, Mr. Jeppson said. Any profit the Mint generates from the sale of its coins is returned to the Treasury. Last year, the Mint sent about $600 million back to the federal government, Mr. Jeppson said. In addition to the 100, 000 gold coins  ?   more than is typical for this sort of commemorative coin  ?   that will be printed at West Point, the Mint will also produce 100, 000 of what it calls medals, silver reproductions of the image that will sell for around $40 to $50. ?The silver medals will be done at Philadelphia, because that is the birthplace of the Mint,? Mr. Jeppson said. The Coinage Act of 1792 established the Mint, and it also mandated that any coins produced include an image of ?liberty? as well as an inscription of the word. Since then, the idea has appeared in many forms on American currency, both circulated and collectible, most often as the feminine Lady Liberty. ?When you look at the very first coins that we produced, they had a   Liberty on there,? Mr. Jeppson said. These coins are already in production. The next ones in the series are in the planning stage. Rough guidelines are given to sets of artists and sculptors, some of whom are staff at the mint and others who are part of a pool, as Mr. Kunz was. Their work is then shared with the members of two commissions  ?   one a group of citizen advisers and one a fine arts commission  ?   who make recommendations on the final design for the coin. ?It?s difficult for us to say what future coins will look like until we get there,? Mr. Jeppson said. All American coins embody the idea of liberty, in keeping with the Mint?s   mandate. But the new coin is what Mr. Jeppson called an ?allegorical liberty,? meaning Lady Liberty does not represent a specific figure from history. Women, in generic depictions or historic ones, have been underrepresented on American currency. The suffrage leader Susan B. Anthony appeared on $1 coins from 1979 to 1981, and Helen Keller, the author and activist, appeared on the reverse image of the Alabama state quarter in 2003. Sacagawea, the Shoshone guide who led Lewis and Clark to the West Coast, appeared on a $1 coin that has been minted since 2000. Last year, after a public campaign to put a woman on the $10 bill, the Treasury secretary, Jacob J. Lew, announced a broad remaking of the nation?s paper currency  ?   the bills that, unlike a $100 coin, circulate among many Americans every day. Harriet Tubman, the abolitionist and former slave, will appear on the $20 bill, and women and civil rights leaders will be added to the $5 and $10 bills. Collectors expect the black Lady Liberty coin to be popular. Whenever the Mint does something new, it creates buzz, said Gilles Bransbourg, a curator with the American Numismatic Society and a research associate at New York University. ?It?s departing from any of the coins that have been produced so far,? he said. ?It sends a strong message that the Mint is departing from the tradition that will be perceived as very white. ? The Mint?s recent commemorative productions have occasionally featured nonwhite characters, he said, pointing to a 2006 gold series that revived the popular ?Indian head? nickel of the early 20th century. It shows an American Indian whose face is believed to be a combination of three different men who sat for its designer. Symbolism aside, the new Lady Liberty coin is ?really beautiful,? said Jeff Garrett, the president of the American Numismatic Association, who saw the coin several months ago in Washington. ?It?s struck in high relief, which means the high points are much higher than circulating coinage. ? ?I?ll buy one for sure,? he said. ?I?ll probably buy several. ?"
18004,Robert Ito,5/02/2017,2017,2,business,"LOS ANGELES  ?   When ?Zoot Suit? first opened at the Mark Taper Forum in 1978, little about the production screamed hit. Much of the cast had scant acting experience. The story itself was a Brechtian take on a relatively obscure unsolved murder in 1942 Los Angeles its climax involved a humiliating assault on a Latino man by racist United States servicemen. Just a decade earlier, its writer and director, Luis Valdez, was creating short skits for audiences of striking farmworkers in the fields of the Central Valley in California. But audiences kept coming, and coming, selling out show after packed show. Fans came one week and returned with their families the next Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead is said to have seen the play 22 times. After running for 11 months to   audiences, first at the Taper and then at the Aquarius Theater in Hollywood, ?Zoot Suit? moved to New York?s Winter Garden in 1979, where it became the first Chicano theatrical production on Broadway. Mr. Valdez then directed a   version, which was released in 1982. ?We had no idea any of this would happen, man,? he said. ?It was like this huge explosion. ? On Tuesday, Jan. 31, a revival of ?Zoot Suit? begins its run at the Taper, kicking off the theater?s   season. A fantastical reimagining of the   Sleepy Lagoon murder case, in which 12 Latino youths were unjustly convicted by a biased judge, ?Zoot Suit? features racist prosecutors and lovelorn kids, lively swing tunes and family squabbles. The infamous Zoot Suit riots, a series of racially motivated attacks against   youths in the summer of 1943, figures in as well. Looming over it all is El Pachuco, a mythical trickster figure who can stop time and materialize wherever he pleases (think Prospero, but with a lot more panache) and ?The Press,? a barking headline made flesh. The show is both a homecoming and a reunion. Four decades after its world premiere, Mr. Valdez, who is 76, is back as director. Daniel Valdez (Luis?s brother) and Rose Portillo, who in 1978 portrayed Henry Reyna and Della Barrios, the young lovers at the heart of the play, this time around play Henry?s parents. ?I got kind of choked up the first time I heard those words all over again,? Daniel Valdez said. ?Coming back to it is a little like coming home. ? In the intervening years, Latino playwrights, from Cherrie Moraga to Luis Alfaro, have made their mark on American theater. Karen Zacarias started the Young Playwrights? Theater in 1995 in 2003, Nilo Cruz became the first Latino to win a Pulitzer for drama. Then there?s   Miranda. But no other Latino play has had the cultural impact of ?Zoot Suit,? not to mention its influence on generations of subsequent Latino playwrights. On a recent morning, the cast rehearsed a scene set in a Los Angeles dance hall. Several men wore   trousers, long watch chains dangling from their belts the women sported   tights and sneakers. The men were strutting, the women spinning, but when a rival gang arrived, colorful curses flew, then fists, and before you knew it, the switchblades were out. El Pachuco snapped his fingers, stopping time just as Henry was about to cut his rival?s throat. ?That?s exactly what the play needs right now,? he said. ?Two more Mexicans killing each other. ? The relevance of this scene in the Trump era isn?t lost on the cast and crew. Much of the play focuses on how   are vilified in the United States as violent criminals and perpetual outsiders  ?   ?this ain?t your country,? El Pachuco tells Henry early on. ?That was part of the reason I felt that I had to be in this production,? said Demiÿn Bichir, the   actor who plays El Pachuco. ?There couldn?t be a better opportunity for the arts to respond to so much nonsense and ignorance and stupidity. ? (When not acting, Mr. Bichir, who is Mexican, is an American Civil Liberties Union celebrity ambassador for immigration rights.) For Luis Valdez, mixing the political and the theatrical is nothing new. Dressed all in black, his voice a rich baritone, he recalled the years that led up to ?Zoot Suit. ? In 1965, he founded El Teatro Campesino, a theater troupe and ?cultural arm? of Cesar Chavez?s United Farm Workers. The group staged   skits, which he wrote and directed, in halls and on the backs of flatbed trucks. After the troupe left the farm workers? group in 1967, Mr. Valdez continued to write plays that examined the Chicano experience, including ?Bandito!? and ?I Don?t Have to Show You No Stinking Badges!? ?I call him the father of contemporary Chicano theater,? said Jorge Huerta, who wrote the book ?Chicano Theater: Themes and Forms. ? ?Not only did he found the Teatro Campesino, the teatro inspired other teatros, an entire movement from the West Coast to the Midwest all the way to the Dakotas. ? In 1977, Mr. Valdez met with Gordon Davidson, who was the director of the Taper then, about creating something for its New Theater for Now series. He arrived clutching a pamphlet about the Sleepy Lagoon murder that he had gotten years earlier from David Sanchez, the founder of the   organization the Brown Berets. ?He essentially gave me carte blanche,? he said. Mr. Valdez set to work on the play, combining elements of Aztec mythology (Tezcatlipoca?s    colors, for example, mirror El Pachuco?s zoot suit) prison letters from the defendants culled from U. C. L. A. Library?s special collections department and court transcripts. In one courtroom sequence from the 1982 film, a police officer testifies that pachucos have an ?inborn? tendency for violence inherited from ?the bloodthirsty Aztecs. ? ?I took that from the transcripts,? Mr. Valdez said. ?I didn?t invent that stuff. That wasn?t agitprop. ? ?The Second Zoot Suit Riot begins,? an ad in a local newspaper declared in 1978. ?That was probably hatched right here in this office,? Mr. Valdez laughed. ?But there was a rush for tickets, so in that sense, it was a riot. A good riot. An artistic riot. ? The play helped start the career of Edward James Olmos, who played El Pachuco in Los Angeles and on Broadway, as well as in the film. Mr. Valdez soon shifted his focus to movies as well  ?   his 1987 Ritchie Valens biopic ?La Bamba? was both a critical and   hit  ?   but he?s still best known for ?Zoot Suit,? which broke Los Angeles theater records for ticket sales during its first run. The Taper, which also hosted the world premiere productions of ?Angels in America? and ?Children of a Lesser God,? hopes to create a similar buzz this time around. Univision and Hoy sponsored a party at the theater to celebrate the first day of ticket sales, complete with   dancers and live swing music. The AltaMed Art Collection in Los Angeles is lending art that will be on display in the theater lobby. Strong sales have prompted the Taper to extend the show?s   run another week, through March 19 even after adding the additional shows, 35 high school groups remain on a waiting list to see special student matinees. ?We do   shows a year, and you can feel the excitement among the staff about having this show rehearse in our building,? said Michael Ritchie, artistic director of the Center Theater Group, which includes the Taper. ?You can feel the buzz in the hallways. ? Those hallways aren?t far from many places, historic and infamous, brought to life in the play. Los Angeles?s Hall of Justice, where the young men were tried and convicted, is two blocks away flash points of the riots erupted in the area. ?Some of the riots actually took place very near where we?re rehearsing,? Daniel Valdez said. ?Temple and Main, right down the street. ? A big difference between this production and the 1978 one is the level of the cast?s experience. ?In those days, there weren?t many Latinos looking for a career in theater, so we were working with a lot of   actors,? Daniel Valdez added. ?We had people who had never really been onstage. Now, watching the casting calls and the dance auditions, they?re absolutely amazing. ? The nationwide call drew 800 actors for 25 parts, and most cast members have backgrounds in film and TV. Mr. Bichir (?The Hateful Eight,? ?Weeds?) a star in his native Mexico before coming to Los Angeles, was nominated for an Academy Award for his role in the 2011 film ?A Better Life? Jeanine Mason, a   actor and dancer from Miami who plays Della, was the youngest competitor to win the Fox series ?So You Think You Can Dance. ? Though the play was written in 1978 and set in 1942, Mr. Valdez feels its story is timeless, its themes part of an   historical cycle. He traces lines from the   internment camps to the Zoot Suit Riots, from Black Lives Matter to the vilification of Muslims. ?And now the Mexicans are getting it again, thanks to Trump,? he said. ?It?s like the closing of a complete circle. ? At a table reading between dance rehearsals, Mr. Bichir and Tom G. McMahon had questions for Mr. Valdez about how to tackle their roles as El Pachuco and the Press. In many ways, they?re more archetypes than people, jumping in and out of the action at will. The challenge, Mr. Valdez said, is finding the human in the trickster spirit. The play presents lots of similar challenges for audiences. ?My play has the same relationship to a normal realistic play as a zoot suit has to a normal suit,? Mr. Valdez said. ?It?s different. The lengths are longer. There?s more fabric. But it?s very cool! And I think that?s part of the appeal. ?"
17420,Nelson D. Schwartz,7/01/2017,2017,1,business,"It has been a long time coming  ?   eight years, in fact  ?   but the economic recovery is finally showing up in the average American worker?s paycheck in a big way. There have been plenty of winners in the recovery, which began in  : companies, homeowners, investors and, especially, households at the apex of the economic pyramid. But the paucity of gains in   pay has stoked anxiety and frustration for many others, a factor in the wave of discontent that   Donald J. Trump rode to victory in November. But even as Mr. Trump prepares to succeed President Obama in two weeks, the Labor Department reported on Friday that average hourly earnings rose by 2. 9 percent last year, the best annual performance since the recovery began. And many economists expect the trend to gain momentum this year, as a tighter labor market forces employers to pay more to hire and retain workers. ?This is a turning point for the overall economy,? said Diane Swonk, a veteran independent economist in Chicago. While wage growth was robust last year, government data for December showed a more tepid increase in employment, with 156, 000 jobs added during the month, and a slight uptick in the unemployment rate to 4. 7 percent. Until recently, a rise in salaries one month would peter out the next, but the upward trajectory in 2016 reflects wage gains even for Americans at the low end of the pay scale, Ms. Swonk said. Leisure and hospitality workers, for example, saw hourly earnings jump 4. 4 percent from a year earlier, equal to the increase enjoyed by employees in the surging technology sector. To be sure, a number of the economic problems cited by Mr. Trump during the campaign remain: millions of former workers not even looking for jobs, ebbing factory positions and fewer opportunities for the 55 percent of Americans without college degrees or other   school credentials. ?Strong economic growth doesn?t really matter if it?s not widely distributed,? Ms. Swonk said. ?You can have a better economy but still not good enough for people who aren?t participating at all. ? A more comprehensive government barometer of unemployment, which includes workers forced to take   jobs because   positions were not available, stood at 9. 2 percent in December, a much higher level than at this point in past recoveries. But rising wages should counter the economic undertow, especially if the gains remain  . And while a 2. 9 percent increase may not sound like much, it goes much further because inflation is about 1. 7 percent. Economists expect wages to rise by up to 3. 5 percent in 2017  ?   still below the gains many workers saw in the recovery of the   and in the   boom of the late 1990s. Although not reflected in the December figures, many   workers are getting raises this year because of state increases in the local minimum wage. Some of the increases were substantial, with Arizona, Maine and Washington each raising the floor by $1. 50 or more an hour. Even in California, where, at 50 cents an hour, the wage gain is not as steep, one in 10 workers has gotten a raise. And   gains can have a spillover effect, pushing up pay for workers just above the bottom salary tier. For all his criticism during the campaign of Mr. Obama?s economic stewardship, Mr. Trump will inherit an economy that is fundamentally solid. Consumer sentiment, corporate profits and the stock market are all at or near multiyear highs. On Friday, Wall Street embraced the       labor market figures, lifting the Dow Jones industrial average close to 20, 000 and a new nominal record. Investors and traders are watching the jobs data closely for clues about when the Federal Reserve Board may next raise interest rates. Last month, the Fed increased interest rates for only the second time in a decade, and policy makers signaled that three more increases could come this year. The wage gains are among the reasons the Fed is likely to stick to that plan, Ms. Swonk, the Chicago economist, said. Monthly job creation last year was well below the 236, 000 average for hiring in 2014 and 2015. But with the economy close to what Fed policy makers and other experts consider full employment, employers are increasing wages, to retain workers and to attract new ones. While the minimum wage increases provide a floor when it comes to pay, the ceiling continues to rise in fields like financial services, sales and technology, said Tom Gimbel, chief executive of LaSalle Network, a Chicago staffing company. ?Across the board, I see more aggressive salaries being offered by corporations than at any time in the last 10 years,? Mr. Gimbel said. Seasoned sales representatives are drawing base salaries of $150, 000 a year, compared with $125, 000 two years ago, according to Mr. Gimbel.   software developers who once started at around $50, 000 a year can now command $70, 000. Other executives in the Midwest also report upward pressure on wages, including in grittier settings than the   fields where engineers and financial professionals cluster. At Lou Malnati?s Pizzeria, which has 46 restaurants in the Chicago area and one in Phoenix,   pay in hourly positions like server, cook and dishwasher is now about $11. 50 an hour, compared with $10 an hour three years ago. Mark Agnew, the chain?s president, said most of the increase was a result of the steady rise in Chicago?s minimum wage, which has gone from $8. 25 in 2014 to $10. 50 now. It is set to hit $13 by summer 2019. ?We want to stay ahead of the minimum wage because we want to attract the best talent,? Mr. Agnew said. A substantial portion of the chain?s 3, 000 workers have been with the company for more than 10 years, a rarity in the   restaurant industry that is another benefit of the slightly higher wages. Economists and politicians have long debated whether raising the minimum wage ultimately hurts workers as companies cut positions or leave them unfilled in the face of rising labor costs. So far, that has not been the case at Lou Malnati?s, Mr. Agnew said. The chain has opened about a dozen new locations in the past three years, adding about 600 workers to its payroll over all. ?It?s very tricky, and I know the minimum wage may erode job creation in some industries,? he said. ?But in my own company, it hasn?t hurt hiring. ?"
17970,"Matthew Rosenberg, Maggie Haberman and Gardiner Harris",27/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"? President Trump, at a political gathering of congressional Republicans, asks, ?Where?s my C. I. A. director?? ? A new Quinnipiac University poll put President Trump?s approval rating at 36 percent, compared to Barack Obama?s 59 percent in the opening weeks of his presidency. ? The professional golfer Bernhard Langer released a statement saying he never told President Trump a story of voter fraud that Mr. Trump relayed to congressional leaders. President Trump may be unaware that America?s spy chiefs are not supposed to be creatures of partisan politics. Speaking on Thursday in Philadelphia at an annual retreat for Republican lawmakers, Mr. Trump seemed to think Mike Pompeo, the new director of the Central Intelligence Agency, would be among the senators, representatives and party operatives hooting and hollering in the crowd. ?Where is Pompeo? Where the hell is he?? Mr. Trump said, scanning the crowd. The answer, in case Mr. Trump has not yet figured it out: Mr. Pompeo was not in Philadelphia. The C. I. A. like the military, is supposed to be apolitical, and its chief does not have a direct role in creating administration policies. Though Mr. Pompeo has attended the Republican retreat in years past  ?   he was a Republican representative before taking over the C. I. A. on Monday  ?   it would be considered highly inappropriate for him to take part in his new role running the country?s premier intelligence agency. It was not the first time that Mr. Trump appeared to mix partisan politics and C. I. A business. He accused the C. I. A. ?s previous leadership of playing politics after American intelligence agencies said they believed that Russia tried to help him win the election. Then, on Saturday, he gave a speech at C. I. A. headquarters that was filled with campaign trail rhetoric. The speech was widely criticized by former C. I. A. officials from both Republican and Democratic administrations. But Mr. Trump, in an interview on Wednesday with ABC News, cast the visit to C. I. A. as a highlight of his first days in office. ?That speech was a home run,? he said. ?I got a standing ovation. In fact, they said it was the biggest standing ovation since Peyton Manning had won the Super Bowl, and they said it was equal. I got a standing ovation. It lasted for a long period of time. ? President Trump, now famously touchy about his approval ratings, is not doing well on that front. A new Quinnipiac University poll put his approval rating among American voters at 36 percent, 33 percent among women. In Quinnipiac?s first poll of Barack Obama?s presidency, Mr. Trump?s predecessor stood at 59 percent. Republican lawmakers who might be considering distancing themselves from their president should consider this: Mr. Trump?s   rating among Republicans is 81 percent to 3 percent. Independent voters are the problem. They are more split, with 45 percent disapproving and 35 percent approving of the job that the president is doing. Gathered with the top leaders of Congress, President Trump on Monday apparently relayed the story in all seriousness: the pro golfer Bernhard Langer had told him a story that really stuck with him. As Mr. Trump relayed it, Mr. Langer had been in line to vote in Florida when he was told by an official that he could not cast a ballot. But people all around him who looked far more suspect  ?   Mr. Trump tossed out the names of Latin American countries that the voters might have come from  ?   were allowed to draw up provisional ballots. There was a problem with the story: Mr. Langer is a German citizen. But Mr. Langer says he never talked to Mr. Trump, that he was told the story by a friend, then told the story to a friend who told it to someone with ties to the White House  ?   who apparently told it to Mr. Trump. He certainly never tried to vote in Florida. So, if the story was important to Mr. Trump?s erroneous belief that millions of illegal immigrants gave Hillary Clinton her 2. 8   win in the popular vote, it was based on   information. There?s a slight problem with President Trump?s Great Wall with Mexico: the Tohono O?odham Nation. The Native American tribe controls about 75 miles of the border of the United States and Mexico that slices through its sovereign territory. Tribal leaders are already saying that the wall is not going to divide its territory. Verlon M. Jose, the Tohono O?odham Nation?s vice chairman, was not subtle when discussing the wall when he spoke in November to Native News Online: ?Over my dead body. ? Tribal officials did say they are willing to meet with President Trump to discuss the matter further. As Mr. Jose said: There may be a Gingrich in the Vatican just yet. Callista Gingrich, the wife of Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and a friend of Mr. Trump?s, is in the running to be ambassador to the Holy See, according to a person briefed on the discussions. Mr. Gingrich, reached by telephone, said that he was aware that his wife had been on a list for the job, but declined to say where things stood. The former speaker took himself out of the running for a cabinet post after it became clear that Mr. Trump was looking elsewhere for a secretary of state. Mr. Trump has known Newt and Callista Gingrich socially for years. They?re members of his golf club in Virginia, and have been at his club,    in Palm Beach, Fla. Mr. Gingrich was one of the people Mr. Trump consulted in 2015 when he had already determined he would run for president. But Mrs. Gingrich is the former speaker?s third wife  ?   not something the church takes a shine to. Others who are being considered for the role include William Simon Jr. a friend of Rudolph W. Giuliani. Four senior management officials at the State Department resigned on Wednesday, leaving the department without the top managers charged with running the administrative, consular and foreign mission operations until their successors are in place. ?As is standard with every transition, the outgoing administration, in coordination with the incoming one, requested all politically appointed officers submit letters of resignation,? Mark Toner, the department?s acting spokesman, said in a statement, adding: ?Of the officers whose resignations were accepted, some will continue in the foreign service in other positions, and others will retire by choice or because they have exceeded the time limits of their grade in service. ? The most senior official to leave is Patrick F. Kennedy, the department?s longtime undersecretary for management, who oversees finances, security, facilities and consular services. But his departure had been expected, in part because of his vigorous defense of   of State Hillary?s Clinton?s handling of the attack on the diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya. He also sought the F. B. I. ?s help in downgrading the security classification of an email from Mrs. Clinton?s private server. Rex Tillerson, nominated to be secretary of state, is not expected to be confirmed by the Senate until next week. Nominations for the department?s deputy positions have yet to be announced or submitted. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said Thursday morning that in spite of President Trump?s perpetual tweet storms, distracting television interviews, occasional lies, and intraparty slights, they are with him on policy. ?We are on the same page with the White House,? Mr. Ryan told reporters in Philadelphia, before a visit from Mr. Trump to the congressional Republican?s policy conference. On the list: a costly wall along the border with Mexico, which Mr. Ryan said would be paid for with a supplemental funding request from the White House and existing federal funding to secure the border. Also on the list is a new tax code and a replacement for the Affordable Care Act  ?   easy! (Remember, Congress dithered for weeks and months to scrape together aid for the victims of tropical storm Sandy, to combat the Zika virus and to help the   residents of Flint, Mich. while conservatives looked for offsetting spending cuts.) As for Trump?s distractions, the leaders seemed to say that?s his special sideshow. ?This is going to be an unconventional presidency,? Mr. Ryan conceded, adding, ?that is something we are all going to have to get used to. ? Mr. McConnell also shrugged off questions about Mr. Trump compromising the United States? relationship with Mexico. ?We intend to address the wall issue ourselves, and the president can deal with his relations with other countries on that issue and other issues,? Mr. McConnell said. The Republican chairmen of the House and Senate veterans? affairs committees dashed off a letter to President Trump Thursday demanding to know whether his executive order freezing federal hiring applied to the Department of Veterans Affairs. Surely you didn?t mean the department under our jurisdiction, suggested Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia and Representative Phil Roe of Tennessee: Don?t be surprised if more such letters emerge as the hiring freeze starts to bite. In a week in which President Trump is busy unraveling much of Barack Obama?s legacy, the former president was defended from an unusual quarter Thursday morning: Mr. Trump. In an   post on Twitter, Mr. Trump expressed outrage that Chelsea Manning, the former Army intelligence analyst whose sentence for leaking American secrets was commuted by Mr. Obama, had criticized the 44th president for not being strong enough. Even though Mr. Trump repeatedly characterized Mr. Obama the same way during last year?s campaign  ?   ?weak attitude and pathetic president,? ?so weak and so bad,? ?he?s been weak, he?s been ineffective?  ?   he evidently thought Ms. Manning was ungracious to do so. Mr. Trump seemed to be referring to a column that Ms. Manning wrote in The Guardian newspaper, in which she argued that Mr. Obama left ?very few permanent accomplishments? because he was too willing to compromise. The column was largely a criticism of Republicans never giving Mr. Obama a chance, but it suggested that he had not been strong enough to resist them. ?The one simple lesson to draw from President Obama?s legacy: Do not start off with a compromise,? Ms. Manning wrote. ?They won?t meet you in the middle. Instead, what we need is an unapologetic progressive leader. ? Wonder where Mr. Trump got his idea?"
17309,Jennifer Steinhauer,2/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"WASHINGTON  ?   The most powerful and ambitious   Congress in 20 years will convene Tuesday, with plans to leave its mark on virtually every facet of American life  ?   refashioning the country?s social safety net, wiping out scores of labor and environmental regulations and unraveling some of the most significant policy prescriptions put forward by the Obama administration. Even before   Donald J. Trump is sworn in on Jan. 20, giving their party full control of the government, Republicans plan quick action on several of their top priorities  ?   most notably a measure to clear a path for the Affordable Care Act?s repeal. Perhaps the first thing that will happen in the new Congress is the push for deregulation. Also up early: filling a   Supreme Court seat, which is sure to set off a pitched showdown, and starting confirmation hearings for Mr. Trump?s cabinet nominees. ?It?s a big job to actually have responsibility and produce results,? said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader. ?And we intend to do it. ? But as Republicans plan to reserve the first 100 days of Congress for their more partisan goals, Democrats are preparing roadblocks. The party?s brutal   wounds have been salted by evidence of Russian election interference, Mr. Trump?s   cabinet picks and his taunting Twitter posts. (On Saturday, he offered New Year?s wishes ?to all,? including ?those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don?t know what to do. ?) Obstacles will also come from Republicans, who are divided on how to proceed with the health care law and a pledge to rewrite the tax code. Some are also skittish about certain policy proposals, like vast changes to Medicare, that could prove unpopular among the broad electorate. And any burst of legislative action will come only if Congress can break free of its longstanding tendency toward gridlock. For Republicans, the path to this moment has been long and transparently paved  ?   the House in particular has signaled the Republican policy vision through bills it has been passing for years. But many of those measures have gathered dust in the Senate or been doused in veto ink. The cleft between the two chambers recalls the situation faced by the insurgent House Republican majority in the  . Speaker Newt Gingrich took control with a determined agenda, only to be stymied by the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, who stacked conservative House bills like so many fire logs in the back of the Senate chamber. ?They?ve been given a golden opportunity here,? said Trent Lott, the former Republican Senate majority leader. ?But I have watched over the years when one party has had control of the White House and the Senate and the House, and the danger is overplaying your hand. ?If you go too far, like what happened with Obamacare, and you get no support at all from the other side, you have a problem,? Mr. Lott continued. ?You have to find a way to work with people across the aisle who will work with you. ? The tax overhaul and an infrastructure bill may be two opportunities for bipartisan cooperation the Senate Finance Committee is already moving in that direction. Still, both of those issues are expected to remain on the back burner, despite promises to the contrary from Mr. Trump?s chief of staff, Reince Priebus. The Senate may be narrowly divided, but among the 48 senators in the Democratic caucus are 10 who will stand for   in two years in states that voted for Mr. Trump. Republicans are counting on their support, at least some of the time. But on many issues, Senate Democrats  ?   including their new leader, Chuck Schumer of New York  ?   are expected to pivot from postelection carping to active thwarting, using complex Senate procedures and political messaging to slow or perhaps block elements of Mr. Trump?s agenda. ?After campaigning on a promise to help the middle class,   Trump?s postelection actions suggest he intends to do the exact opposite after he?s sworn in,? said Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington. ?Democrats will do everything we can to fight back if he continues to pursue an agenda prioritizing billionaires and big corporations while devastating   families and the economy. ? Republicans have chafed for years at a host of rules, many   that President Obama has issued through the regulatory process, and they have been advising the Trump team on which ones should be undone. ?I hear probably more about the strangulation of regulations on business and their growth and their development than probably anything else,? the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, said at a recent forum. ?I think if we can provide regulatory relief right away, that can breathe a sigh of relief into the economy. ? In late December, the Obama administration rolled out a major new environmental regulation intended to rein in   mining. That regulation, one of dozens that Mr. Trump is expected to reverse, is meant to go into effect one day before his inauguration. But Congress is likely to block it, using the obscure Congressional Review Act, which permits lawmakers to undo new regulations with only 51 Senate votes within the first 60 legislative days of the rules? completion. Given time constraints on the Senate floor, members will have to pick some priorities. They are expected to train their sights on a rule that requires oil and gas producers to reduce methane gases, another that requires mining and fossil fuel companies to disclose payments they have made to foreign governments to extract natural resources, and still others that restrict pesticide use. Republicans will also move quickly to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They plan to pass a truncated budget resolution for the remainder of the fiscal year  ?   already a quarter over  ?   that includes special instructions ensuring that the final repeal legislation could circumvent any Democratic filibuster. But Republican leaders have not settled on a health care plan to replace Mr. Obama?s, and they may delay the repeal measure?s effective date for years. The Senate must also consider Mr. Trump?s cabinet picks, and Senate Democrats are already trying to slow the process. However, they cannot do much more than that, because when they were in charge, they changed the rules so that presidential nominees other than Supreme Court picks need only 51 votes to be confirmed. Previously, such nominations could face a filibuster, which required 60 votes to overcome. Democratic leaders have encouraged members to avoid meeting with Mr. Trump?s nominees until they have turned over their tax returns and made other disclosures. Republicans have been particularly upset that Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, whom Mr. Trump picked quickly to be attorney general, has either not gotten meetings with Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee or had meetings canceled. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California postponed her meeting with Mr. Sessions until January because, she said, her schedule got too busy. ?The senator doesn?t want to rush,? said her spokesman, Tom Mentzer. One reason that Democrats are in no hurry is their bitterness over Mr. McConnell?s refusal last year to hold a hearing on the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland. Lingering in the background is the specter of Russia. Democrats  ?   and some Republicans, who are at odds with Mr. Trump on the issue and may at times be a brake on him  ?   want a vigorous investigation of its efforts to disrupt the election. The Obama administration, which took sweeping steps last week to punish the Russians over election hacking, will release a report this month that is likely to serve as a turning point in those discussions. While Republicans may have a rare chance to open the flow of legislation, the party?s leaders are acutely aware of the punishment that Americans have historically delivered in midterm elections when things have not gone well. ?This is no time for hubris,? Mr. McConnell said. ?You have to perform. ?"
18202,Robert Pear and Reed Abelson,3/02/2017,2017,2,politics,"WASHINGTON  ?   Congress?s rush to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, once seemingly unstoppable, is flagging badly as Republicans struggle to come up with a replacement and a key senator has declared that the effort is more a repair job than a demolition. ?It is more accurate to say ?repair Obamacare,?? Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and chairman of the Senate health committee, said this week. ?We can repair the individual market, and that is a good place to start. ? The struggles and false starts have injected more uncertainty into insurance markets that thrive on stability. An aspirational deadline of Jan. 27 for repeal legislation has come and gone. The powerful retirees? lobby AARP is mobilizing to defend key elements of the Affordable Care Act. Republican leaders who once saw a health law repeal as a quick first strike in the Trump era now must at least consider a worst case: unable to move forward with comprehensive health legislation, even as the uncertainty that they helped foster rattles consumers and insurers. Insurers are threatening to exit the Affordable Care Act?s market unless the Trump administration and Congress can quickly clarify their intentions: Will they support the existing public marketplaces, encourage people to sign up and keep federal assistance flowing to insurers, or not? ?We need some certainty around the rules,? said Dr. J. Mario Molina, chief executive of Molina Healthcare, which has been a stalwart in the Affordable Care Act market and is making money under the system. ?We have a few months, but we don?t have a lot of time,? he said. With the official end on Tuesday of what was supposed to be its final open enrollment season, the Affordable Care Act is looking more resilient than it seemed just a month ago. It will still be several days before final enrollment figures are released, and although a surge of   signups failed to have materialize amid talk of repeal, early indications did not point to a collapse. At their annual retreat last week, in Philadelphia, several congressional Republicans edged away from their powerful promise to ?repeal and replace? the Affordable Care Act. It would, they said, be more accurate to say they intend to fix a law that they blame for the cancellation of many insurance policies, soaring premiums and a shrinking choice of health plans in many states. Many Republicans say their resolve to dismantle the law, a central element of President Barack Obama?s legacy, is undiminished. ?We are looking to repeal this law, just like we told the voters we were going to do, just like we promised them we would do,? said Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio and a leader of the House?s most conservative wing. ?After all, there was an election where that was one of the most important issues. ? But after waging and winning many elections with a promise to kill it, Republicans still have no agreement on how to replace it. They will, they say, pursue a piecemeal approach because they have no desire to supplant the giant 2010 health law with a single comprehensive Republican plan cooked up in Washington. When Congress convened this year, Republicans immediately introduced a budget resolution clearing the way for legislation to gut the health law, with strong support from Mr. Trump, who took office 17 days later. But Mr. Trump?s rocky start has slowed the momentum, depleting his political capital and dimming prospects for bipartisan cooperation. In addition, many senators are preoccupied with fights over the confirmation of Mr. Trump?s nominees to the Supreme Court and top jobs in his administration. What was once considered Congress?s Job No. 1 is being eclipsed for some lawmakers by more immediate matters. Insurers say Republicans? mixed messages and slowing pace could send premiums soaring next year while making the market much less stable. The deadline to file rates for 2018 is this spring, and insurers say they need time to decide what kinds of plans to offer and to set prices. ?We need stability and predictability,? said Marilyn B. Tavenner, the chief executive of America?s Health Insurance Plans, the main lobby for the industry. Unless Congress continues   subsidies, to reduce    costs for   people, and a reinsurance program, to help pay large claims, she said, more insurers will pull out of the market. Insurers are also concerned about signs that the Trump administration may not enforce the   individual mandate, which requires people to have insurance or face a tax penalty. The penalty, or some way to encourage more participation, is seen as central to having enough young and healthy people sign up to keep premiums low. ?It?s very important to indicate how they are going to stabilize the market,? said Karen M. Ignagni, the chief executive of EmblemHealth, who was instrumental in the development of the current law. At the very least, analysts say the uncertainty for insurers could lead to much higher rates. ?2018 is a wild card,? said Deep Banerjee, who follows insurers for Standard  Poor?s. Many insurers could simply end up walking away, warned Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University who recently surveyed insurers about what they might do. ?At a certain point, you can?t price high enough to account for that uncertainty,? she said. The end game is perhaps predictable. In the Senate, Republicans will need help from Democrats to replace the health law because they hold 52 seats but will need 60 votes. Several Republican senators, like Susan Collins of Maine and Bob Corker of Tennessee, say they will not vote to repeal the law unless they have a clear picture of what will replace it. And Democrats will not support any replacement unless Republicans scrap the idea of an outright repeal, which conservatives have been demanding for years. ?We can?t repair the roof while Republicans and the president are burning the house down,? said Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington. Republicans have many ideas about how to shore up insurance markets and lower costs. But it is highly unlikely that any of their proposals would be found by the Congressional Budget Office to insure as many people as the Affordable Care Act. Downbeat assessments from the budget office have doomed many proposals in the past, including the health care plan devised by Bill and Hillary Clinton in 1993. Mr. Trump chose Representative Tom Price, Republican of Georgia, to be his secretary of health and human services, with the expectation that he would work closely with Republicans in Congress on the details of a replacement plan. Democrats have delayed his confirmation, and that in turn has delayed Republican efforts to devise an alternative to the health care law they detest. Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee voted on Wednesday to recommend confirmation of Mr. Price, overriding objections by Democrats, who boycotted the proceedings. All of that turmoil in Washington has left insurers scrambling. ?While the direction in Washington has been positive, we still need certainty about   fixes in order to determine the extent of our participation,? Joseph R. Swedish, the chief executive of Anthem, one of the nation?s largest insurers and a major player in the market, told investors on Wednesday. Anthem said it expected to break even or make money selling individual coverage this year but said the market continued not to work as well as it could. ?We have weighed in considerably, and continue to do so, with all the leadership in Congress,? Mr. Swedish said."
17896,Ann Carrns,23/01/2017,2017,1,lifestyle,"THE decorations have been put away, and mailboxes are now filling with credit card bills instead of holiday cards. If you binged on gifts and entertainment in December and your card balances are higher than you were expecting, it?s important to make a plan to pay down the debt as quickly as possible, credit experts say. ?Don?t put those bills aside, thinking they?ll look better if you come back to them later,? said Bruce McClary, spokesman for the National Foundation for Credit Counseling. When it comes to paying down   card debt, he said, ?time is not your friend. ? If you have sound credit but got a bit carried away with   spending, you may want to consider transferring your balances to a   credit card. Zero percent balance transfer offers allow you to affordably pay the debt over time, and some cards are offering people with healthy credit scores terms as long as 12 to 21 months, said Nick Clements, a   of MagnifyMoney. The catch, he said, is that consumers must be disciplined and make the payments on time, or they risk losing the promotional offer. That means they will be back to paying   interest rates. Also, he said, try to find a card that doesn?t charge a transfer fee, which often is 3 to 4 percent of the balance being transferred. If you have a large balance, you may not be able to transfer the full amount, depending on the new card?s credit limit. But, he noted, you can save money by transferring even part of the debt to a 0 percent card. Another option that is becoming more common, Mr. Clements said, is a personal loan, often made by online lenders or, increasingly, traditional banks. The loans are unsecured, just like the debt from a credit card, but they have a fixed repayment term  ?   typically three to five years. Some lenders will make loans for larger amounts, and interest rates can be as low as 5 or 6 percent for borrowers with good credit. But Mr. Clements cautioned that the loans might have upfront fees and, because they are   loans, borrowers must make uniform monthly payments. Borrowers can?t fall back on making low ?minimum? payments, as they can with a credit card if money gets tight. ?That flexibility goes away,? he said. Also, rates will be higher for those with    credit. So you will need to compare the rate on your card with the loan rate to see if you will actually save money. Often, he said, borrowers can check their potential rate without having the inquiry affect their credit report. To help keep card balances from getting out of hand in the first place, Julie Pukas, head of United States bank card and merchant services at TD Bank, suggests that cardholders make use of text or email alerts to notify them when their spending is approaching their credit limit, when their balance reaches a certain limit or when a payment is due. ?They can help get control of their accounts just by receiving reminders,? she said. Ms. Pukas also suggested that cardholders using rewards programs check to see if they can receive their points or   rewards as a credit on their card statement to help pay down their balance. Bill Hardekopf, the chief executive of LowCards. com, recommended that consumers try making micropayments over the course of a month, rather than waiting until the account due date to make a   payment. If you have extra cash, you can make a payment at any time and reduce the interest you will pay if you carry a balance, he said. Here are some questions and answers about paying off credit cards: What credit cards currently offer 0 percent interest without a transfer fee? Chase Slate offers 15 months at 0 percent without a transfer fee, and some credit unions offer 12 months with no transfer fee, Mr. Clements said. Other cards have relatively low balance transfer fees of 3 percent and lengthy terms: Citibank?s Simplicity card offers 21 months, and Discover It offers 18 months. What is the best way to pay off multiple credit cards? One way is to list all your cards, in order of highest interest rate to lowest, regardless of the balance. You put all of your extra cash toward paying down the first card balance, then move down the list until all are paid off. (You must continue making at least the minimum monthly payment on all the cards, to keep them in good standing.) The thinking with this ladder method is that paying off the most costly debt first saves you money. But some consumers with multiple cards may do better paying off the smallest balance first. Most people don?t even know what the interest rates are on their various cards (the average consumer has four) and the rates on cards held by a single consumer tend to be similar, since they are based on one?s credit score, said Remi Trudel, assistant professor of marketing at the Questrom School of Business at Boston University. He and several colleagues recently published a study suggesting that paying off the card with the smallest debt first provides a feeling of accomplishment and encourages consumers to keep going and pay off more debt. ?It?s more motivating,? he said. Once I pay off a card balance, should I close the account? Ms. Pukas of TD Bank says she generally doesn?t recommend closing card accounts, since doing so may actually harm your credit score. (Closing an account can affect your utilization score, a measure of how much credit you have available.) Rather, she suggests putting the card aside in a drawer for safekeeping."
17919,Isabel Kershner,25/01/2017,2017,1,business,"JERUSALEM  ?   In a pointed act of defiance against international pressure, Israel on Tuesday approved a huge new wave of settlement construction in the occupied West Bank. The announcement made clear that just a few days into the Trump presidency, the Israeli government feels emboldened to shake off the constraints imposed by the Obama administration and more willing to disregard international condemnation. Leaders from 70 countries met in Paris more than a week ago and issued a warning that the   peace solution was imperiled by Israel?s expanding of settlements in   territory in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, as well as violence against Israelis. But even though Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has endorsed the principle of    states, in the past few days Israel?s campaign of settlement building has only accelerated. The first step came on Sunday, when the Jerusalem City Council approved 566 new housing units in East Jerusalem that had been delayed over President Barack Obama?s objections. Then on Tuesday, the Israeli government announced that 2, 500 new housing units would be built in the West Bank. Officials said most would be built in ?settlement blocs,? referring to areas of the West Bank that Israel has long intended to keep under any future agreement with the Palestinians, possibly in return for land swaps along the boundary that separated Israel from the West Bank before the 1967 war. But in years of failed negotiations, the Israelis and Palestinians have never agreed on the size or location of such blocs. The Israeli Ministry of Defense said 900 of the newly announced homes were being planned for Ariel, an urban settlement of about 20, 000 residents that Israel considers a ?bloc,? but is strategically  ?   and problematically  ?   located in the heart of the West Bank. It also said it would bring to the cabinet a plan to build a large industrial zone to create work for Palestinians in the southern West Bank. ?We are going back to normal life in Judea and Samaria,? Avigdor Lieberman, Israel?s   defense minister, said in a statement announcing the new settlement building, referring to the West Bank by its biblical names. Asked about the Israeli move, the White House spokesman, Sean Spicer, said that Mr. Trump was still getting his team together and that there would be discussions with Mr. Netanyahu. ?Israel continues to be a huge ally of the United States,? Mr. Spicer said. ?He wants to grow closer with Israel to make sure that it gets the full respect that it deserves in the Middle East, and that?s what he?s going to do. Palestinian officials immediately denounced the new plans. ?Once again, the Israeli government has proved that it is more committed to land theft and colonialism than to the   solution and the requirements for peace and stability,? Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization?s executive committee, said in a statement. ?It is evident that Israel is exploiting the inauguration of the new American administration to escalate its violations and the prevention of any existence of a Palestinian state,? she added, calling on the United States and other international players to take concrete measures against Israeli settlement activities. Israel?s campaign of settlement construction has brought widespread criticism. A month ago, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution condemning Israel?s settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem as having no legal validity and constituting a ?flagrant violation under international law? after the Obama administration decided not to veto the measure. Days later, the departing secretary of state, John Kerry, rebuked Israel?s settlement activities in an impassioned speech, saying, ?The status quo is leading toward one state and perpetual occupation. ? But with Israel?s occupation of the West Bank in its 50th year, the Israeli government, dominated by   and religious parties, is clearly expecting a friendlier approach from the White House after years of tension with the Obama administration. David M. Friedman, the bankruptcy lawyer President Trump has nominated as his ambassador to Israel, has led a   arm of the settlement movement and has dismissed the idea of a Palestinian state alongside Israel. He has declared that he intends to work in Jerusalem, not Tel Aviv, where the American Embassy has been for decades, under the State Department?s insistence that the holy city?s status be determined as part of a broader deal between Israel and the Palestinians. It was not immediately clear whether the Israeli announcement had been coordinated in advance with Mr. Trump?s team. But beyond Mr. Netanyahu?s apparent attempt to chart a new course with Mr. Trump, he is also under intense pressure from the right flank of his governing coalition to demonstrate where his domestic loyalties lie. Naftali Bennett, the education minister and leader of the staunchly   Jewish Home party, has been goading the prime minister to seize the moment and take the extreme step of beginning a process of annexing the West Bank settlements to Israel. ?Netanyahu is facing a historic decision: sovereignty or Palestine,? Mr. Bennett said on Monday. ?We urge Netanyahu, don?t miss an opportunity that comes along once every 50 years. ? Mr. Netanyahu appeared to postpone any discussion of annexation: ?This is no time for    decisions or political dictations, and this is no time for surprises. ? This, he added, ?is the time for considered, responsible diplomacy among friends. ? The prime minister?s office said that in a phone conversation with Mr. Trump on Sunday, Mr. Netanyahu discussed the peace process and hoped to forge a ?common vision? with Mr. Trump ?to advance peace and security in the region, with no daylight between the United States and Israel. ? No more details were given. The peace process has been at an impasse since the last round of   talks collapsed in the spring of 2014. During the nine months of talks, Mr. Netanyahu attempted to appease Israel?s right wing by advancing plans for about 13, 000 new housing units in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, infuriating the Palestinian side. The weakened Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, who appeared reluctant to take risks of his own, never responded to the ideas that Mr. Kerry?s team had formulated for a framework to guide further negotiations. Now, with the change of American administrations, some Israeli analysts have recommended that Mr. Netanyahu take the opportunity to try to reinstate understandings that Israel had with President George W. Bush, who wrote in a 2004 letter that ?already existing major Israeli population centers? should be taken into consideration in redrawing the borders between Israel and the West Bank  ?   a reference to settlement blocs. But that came in the context of Israel?s plans to unilaterally withdraw from Gaza and from a section of the northern West Bank. And the case of Ariel serves to illustrate the contentiousness of unilaterally defining the blocs. Israelis have long labeled Ariel part of their national ?consensus,? meaning that it would be included in Israel?s borders under any peace deal, and it often appears as one of the regular dots on Israeli weather maps. But Palestinian negotiators have always rejected that idea, arguing that Israeli control over Ariel would preclude the territorial contiguity of a Palestinian state. They also note that Ariel sits on a major aquifer. According to Tuesday?s announcement, 20 of the new units are to be built in Beit El, a settlement deep in the West Bank that has particularly benefited from Mr. Friedman?s   activities. The government promised in 2012 to build 300 units in Beit El, a settlement of about 7, 000 residents, to compensate for the   evacuation of part of a neighborhood there that was illegally built on private Palestinian land. So far, the promise has remained unfulfilled. According to Israel?s Ministry of Defense, bids will now be solicited for the construction of about 900 of the 2, 500 new units around the West Bank. But the rest, including most of those planned for Ariel, still have to go through additional planning phases, a bureaucratic process that can take months, if not years, and requires additional government approval at each stage. Oded Revivi, the chief foreign envoy of the Yesha Council, an umbrella organization representing the more than 400, 000 settlers in the West Bank, said in a statement, ?We hope that this is just the beginning of a wave of new building across our ancestral homeland after eight very difficult years. ? But some in the settler camp played down the construction plans and expressed suspicions about Mr. Netanyahu?s intentions. ?We are not stupid,? Bezalel Smotrich, a legislator from the Jewish Home party, wrote in a post on his Facebook page. Objecting to the government announcement mostly describing the advancement of existing plans in settlement blocs, Mr. Smotrich accused Mr. Netanyahu of ?throwing a candy? to the settlers and playing ?public relations tricks. ?"
17443,Neil Irwin,7/01/2017,2017,1,business,"The United States system for taxing businesses is a mess. If there?s one thing nearly everyone can agree upon, it is that. The current corporate income tax manages the weird trick of both taxing companies at a higher statutory rate than other advanced countries while collecting less money, as a percentage of the overall economy, than most of them. It is infinitely complicated and it gives companies incentives to borrow too much money and move operations to countries with lower tax rates. Now, the moment for trying to fix all of that appears to have arrived. With the House, Senate and presidency all soon to be in Republican hands and with all agreeing that a major tax bill is a top priority, some kind of change appears likely to happen. And it may turn out to be a very big deal, particularly if a tax plan that House Republicans proposed last summer becomes the core of new legislation. Among Washington?s lobbying shops and policy analysis crowd, it?s known as a ?  cash flow tax with border adjustment. ? It?s easier to think of it as the most substantial reworking of how businesses are taxed since the corporate income tax was introduced a century ago. And it could, if enacted, have big effects not just in the tax departments of major corporations but in global financial markets and the aisles of your local Walmart. This possible revamping of the corporate tax code is less politically polarizing than the debates sure to unfold in the months ahead over health care, or even over individual income taxes. But the consequences for business  ?   and for the   trajectory of the economy  ?   are huge. The basic idea behind a D. B. C. F. T. (to use the abbreviation that has taken hold in a particularly nerdy corner of Twitter) is this: Right now companies are taxed based on their income generated in the United States. But there are countless tricks that corporate accountants can play to reduce the income companies report and to reduce their tax burden, and those tricks distort the economy. Two prime examples are transferring intellectual property to overseas holding companies and engaging in corporate inversions that move a company?s legal headquarters to a country with lower taxes. Moreover, because interest payments on debt are   the current system makes it appealing to take on as much debt as possible, even though that can increase the risk of bankruptcy when a downturn comes along. The House Republicans? approach, instead of taxing the    corporate income, goes after a firm?s domestic cash flow: money that comes in from sales within the United States borders minus money that goes out to pay employees and buy supplies and so forth. There?s no incentive to play games with overseas companies that exist only to exploit tax differences or to relocate production to countries with lower taxes because you?ll be taxed on things you sell in the United States, regardless. ?With an income tax, one of the key issues is ?how do you measure income,? ? said Alan Auerbach, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, who is a leading advocate of the idea. ?But with cash flow you just follow the money. ? And the tax, Mr. Auerbach argues, could spur business investment while not encouraging companies to rely on debt. It allows companies to enjoy the tax savings of capital investments immediately rather than depreciating them over time. And it doesn?t give favorable treatment to debt, as opposed to equity. That alone would amount to a major shift in the tax system. Congressional staff members, the incoming administration and armies of lobbyists will spend countless hours hammering out the details of any such proposal: how it might be phased in, and how to treat financial services, and much more. Some of the most complex, and politically problematic, elements of the plan revolve around its treatment of international trade, which creates winners and losers. And some of those potential losers are powerful. Consider what border adjustment means: When an American company exports goods under this new tax system, it would not pay any taxes on its international sales, while its imports would be taxed. So a company that spent $80 making something that it sold overseas for $100 would pay no tax on its earnings. A company that imported goods worth $80 from abroad and them sold them domestically for $100 would pay tax on the full $100. At first glance this looks as if it would boost exports and reduce the trade deficit. Indeed, it might prove politically promising for advocates of the strategy to pitch the plan as one that would do this. Many economists think it won?t work that way, however. That?s because as soon as a    tax with border adjustment looks likely to become law, the value of the dollar should rise in currency markets. And that stronger dollar could eliminate the apparent     effects of the tax. The dollar could rise by, say, 20 to 25 percent, and the trade balance could remain about where it started. Essentially, moving to this system means betting on a ?textbook economic theory,? as analysts at Evercore ISI put it, becoming a reality even though the effect hasn?t been tested in practice. If the dollar doesn?t strengthen as expected, for example,   industries, especially those with lean profit margins, could face disaster. That helps explain why some of the stiffest opposition to this tax overhaul is coming from the retail industry. Essentially, economists are telling them ?trust us, our models say the currency will adjust and it will all come out in the wash,? but if the models are wrong, for companies like Walmart, Target and many others that sell large volumes of imported goods, their viability could be threatened. If the models turn out to be right, there is a different set of risks. The United States dollar is the linchpin of the global financial system, and a large move in its value triggered by changes in domestic tax policy could have unforeseen effects. Many companies worldwide, especially banks and especially in emerging markets, have debt denominated in dollars, which would become more of a burden after a new dollar appreciation. A big dollar rise would also effectively shift trillions in wealth from American investments overseas toward global investors with assets in the United States. As Jared Bernstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has noted, we don?t really know what the distributional consequences of this tax overhaul would be. It could increase the costs of imported goods that the poor spend a disproportionate portion of their income on, like clothing and gasoline. That would be bad news for poorer Americans even as it makes the overall economy more efficient. There?s still a lot of work to be done to understand the   consequences of the D. B. C. F. T. (also, work to be done to find a catchier name). But there?s a broader point about the nature of any major policy reform. The benefits of a reworked corporate tax code would emerge slowly these disruptions and costs could arrive almost instantly. No matter the outcome, 2017 will be a fascinating year in which core components of the tax system  ?   with   economic consequences  ?   will be up for grabs."

The show, originally announced in 2015, is to premiere in New York during the   season before embarking on a   tour of ?traditional and nontraditional venues,? according to the Universal Music Group. ?I want everyone to see it,? Mr. Simmons said in a phone interview on Saturday. ?I want kids in the ?hood in Detroit to see it. I want sophisticated theatergoers in New York to see it. And they?re going love it whether they?re 50 or 14. ? Mr. Simmons, 59, emphasized the intended   appeal of ?The Scenario,? which he said would include songs from Universal?s catalog that cover rap?s ascension as a dominant   force. ?The difference between Rakim and Kendrick Lamar is minimal,? Mr. Simmons said, referring to two   artists whose rises occurred nearly three decades apart. Tracks by Drake, Mr. Lamar, Kurtis Blow and the Sugarhill Gang are among those being strongly considered for the production, Mr. Simmons said. Universal owns Def Jam Recordings, which Mr. Simmons founded in 1984 with the producer Rick Rubin. The label, whose artists have included Beastie Boys, Public Enemy and Kanye West, is credited with helping to bring   to the mainstream. Named for a song by A Tribe Called Quest, ?The Scenario? will follow a few artists as they ?struggle and evolve,? according to Mr. Simmons, and he said the production would more closely resemble a concert than a Broadway musical. The audience will have a sizable role, playing on a    tactic often used in  . ?There?s a lot of technology that we?ll be using to connect the audience and the stage in a way that Broadway hasn?t done,? Mr. Simmons said. ?The Scenario? will pair Mr. Simmons with Universal?s Scott Landis, Def Pictures? Jake Stein and the ?Rock of Ages? producers Scott Prisand and Jamie Bendell. The author and   historian Dan Charnas (?The Big Payback?) is writing the show?s book. ?The Scenario? follows the breakout success of ?Hamilton,? the   musical that set a record for the most money ever made in a single week by a Broadway show. On Saturday, Mr. Simmons said that he loved that show and was thrilled about its success, but he bristled at the idea that its popularity has been surprising given the omnipresence of   in American life. ?There?s a lack of insight on the part of the gatekeepers and the producers of content,? he said. ?I can go anywhere and hear  .

18156,Andrew E. Kramer,1/02/2017,2017,2,crime,"MOSCOW  ?   The war in eastern Ukraine that simmered quietly for months has erupted in a lethal bout of fighting in recent days. The violence, which killed at least eight Ukrainian soldiers and three on the   side, shifted the front lines by only a few hundred yards in several spots, but potentially complicates American efforts to improve relations with Russia. The United States Army helps to train and equip Ukrainian soldiers, who are fighting   separatists in two eastern provinces of Ukraine, in the only active war in Europe today. In the latest outbreak, the sides vied for control of what are known as ?gray zone? territories, areas between the front lines that had previously been in buffer zones. The Ukrainian Army advanced in at least two places, according to news reports and official Ukrainian accounts, but it said it did so to rebuff rebel attacks. Each side blamed the other for the escalation. Referring to one   town, an adviser to the Ukrainian Interior Ministry, Yuri Kasyanov, told Radio Free Europe on Tuesday, ?The defenders of Avdiivka preferred to advance the line? to a more defensible position. Ukraine?s Foreign Affairs Ministry issued a statement appealing to Western governments to intervene diplomatically. ?For the last two days, the Russian occupation forces carried out massive attacks across the line,? firing with rocket artillery, heavy mortars and other   weapons, the statement said. European monitors reported heavy shelling of  Avdiivka since Sunday. Journalists who visited the town reported evidence of a psychological warfare operation of a sophistication that suggested Russian involvement. Cellphones in the town received text messages addressed to Ukrainian soldiers, who often carry phones, saying, ?You are just meat to your commanders. ? The shelling disrupted electrical and water supplies. The Ukrainian authorities set up heated shelters for residents whose homes had been damaged, as nighttime temperatures dropped to minus 18 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 28 Celsius). ?Given harsh weather conditions and the continuing shelling by the militants, the humanitarian situation in the area continues to deteriorate,? the Foreign Affairs Ministry?s statement said. The authorities said they were preparing to evacuate the town?s 16, 000 residents. The rebel governments of the Luhansk and Donetsk People?s Republics, which are not recognized internationally, issued a joint statement addressed to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and President Trump that also called for a diplomatic solution. The Trump administration?s maneuvering for better relations with Russia has alarmed Ukrainian officials, who fear that Western pressure could ease on Russia to withdraw its unacknowledged military forces in eastern Ukraine. But Ukraine is not without options in defending itself, including using its army, which showed an ability to fight even before American training began. Since the   line of contact was initially negotiated in a   in September 2014, the Ukrainian Army has in places given ground after separatist attacks. With its recent advance, the army moved back into at least one such area, near Avdiivka, without crossing the original   line, Mr. Kasyanov, the adviser to the Interior Ministry, said."
17406,Niraj Chokshi,5/01/2017,2017,1,law,"Nearly 200 of the approximately 450 people who asked Gov. Peter Shumlin of Vermont to forgive their misdemeanor marijuana convictions had their wish fulfilled this week. In one of his final acts in office, Governor Shumlin on Tuesday pardoned 192 people convicted of marijuana possession, fulfilling a promise he made early last month to consider forgiveness for anyone who applied by Christmas. ?While attitudes and laws about marijuana use are rapidly changing, there is still a harmful stigma associated with it,? Mr. Shumlin, a Democrat, said in a statement on Tuesday. ?My hope was to help as many individuals as I could overcome that stigma and the very real struggles that too often go along with it. ? Such charges can stand in the way of finding work, being accepted to college and traveling internationally. The pardons were limited to people who had no violent criminal histories or felony convictions, and who had not been found guilty of driving under the influence or reckless driving. People who did not apply for a pardon under Mr. Shumilin can still apply to have marijuana possession convictions expunged from their record through a court process established under a 2013 state decriminalization law. Mr. Shumlin cited that law and his own support for legalizing marijuana as the basis for the pardons. ?Vermont should follow the many states that are legalizing and regulating the use of marijuana and put to an end the incredible failure that is the War on Drugs,? he said in the statement. His successor, Phil Scott, a Republican, has urged caution, though he has signaled he may be open to legalization eventually. He is scheduled to be sworn in on Thursday and has said that he supports the pardons, according to local news reports. Those who received the pardons ranged in age from 22 to 69, though most were younger than 40. All but 15 live in Vermont. In all, Mr. Shumlin has issued 208 pardons since taking office in 2010, more than any other governor in the history of the state, his office said."
18194,Sophia Kercher,2/02/2017,2017,2,lifestyle,"After a traumatic breakup, Julia Scinto, a fashion designer in Manhattan, found herself searching online sites far and wide, looking for any available resource to help her feel better. ?I even considered hypnosis,? said Ms. Scinto, who designs women?s wear for Macy?s private label. Instead, she discovered Mend, an app and online community that serves as part personal trainer, part online refuge for the brokenhearted. On the Mend app, users are introduced to an animated avatar of the Mend founder, Ellen Huerta, and her reassuring voice offers guidance on how to move forward, with topics like ?detoxing? from your ex redefining your sense of self  ?   even how to get a better night?s sleep. ?It?s this charming and endearing voice of a friend,? Ms. Scinto said. ?And there?s a line, ?We never get tired of hearing about your breakup,? and those words are like an oasis in the desert. ? Geri Dugan, who works as a psychiatric nurse practitioner in Chicago, knows all too well the mixed emotions that come after a love affair ends. After being stunned by a relationship that didn?t work out, she said, she felt like an ?emotional basket case. ? Ms. Dugan found Mend through Ms. Huerta?s podcast ?Love Is Like a Plant. ? Now, for more than eight months, she has been applying Mend?s daily regime, which includes monitoring one?s   journaling exercises, a Spotify playlist and a book club on Good Reads. She has also navigated through difficult days with support from Mend?s Facebook group. It ?really helped normalize the experience,? Ms. Dugan said, adding, ?I?m even recommending it to some of my patients going through things like divorce. ? In her Santa Monica, Calif. office, just blocks from the Pacific, Ms. Huerta, 30, with a tumble of dark hair and giant blue eyes, admitted that she had always been drawn to matters of the heart. ?Mend started very organically after I went through a breakup,? she said between sips of her   rooibos tea. ?I had a lot of resources at my disposal  ?   I had supportive friends and access to therapy  ?   but I still was having such a hard time moving forward. ? Ms. Huerta, identified by the name Elle on Mend, found online sites that offer breakup advice to be disappointing, with generic insights like ?It just takes time? or wearisome directives like ?Post a photo on social media of yourself with someone new. ? She said she set out to build a better digital experience for the newly solo, where users could shake their feeling of helplessness and take action. As a former Google employee, she was familiar with the tech field and took her cues from fitness and   apps. ?We are taking those parts of our lives very seriously,? she said. ?Yet we weren?t doing that with our love lives, which is at the core of who we are. ? Mend started as a newsletter focused on recovering from heartbreak. Now the company is working with Silicon Beach?s highly selective business accelerator MuckerLab (whose portfolio includes tech companies like TaskRabbit and the Black Tux). MuckerLab invested seed money in Mend and assists Ms. Huerta with business development, including product design and marketing. Still less than a year old, the app has been downloaded in more than 100 countries, and many Mend users return for the supportive community, which spills over with tales of solidarity. ?One of my personal missions is to erase the shame and taboo of heartbreak as something to just get over,? Ms. Huerta said. One way she addresses that is by drawing on her background in science. (She has a degree in geosciences from Wellesley, and her father is a geophysicist.) She counsels the Mend community that it?s not just emotion that causes a wave of intense feelings, it?s also biology. ?It?s different for everyone,? Ms. Huerta said, ?but when you go through a separation with someone who you have been intimate with, your body can tell that there?s been a separation. You?re giving off hormones, and they are giving off hormones, over time you become addicted to that source of   hormones. ? She pointed to a 2016 study published in the Frontiers in Psychology journal, in which researchers found that romantic love stimulates the same area of the brain as addiction does, with symptoms like euphoria, craving and emotional and physical dependence. Love?s addictionlike qualities, the study states, have developed in humans to encourage procreation and, thus, our very existence. Although much of Ms. Huerta?s advice for Mend users is grounded either in science or in her own romantic mistrials, and she encourages a range of options, like meditation and   teas, she firmly believes in the magic and mystery of love, which no data, chart or study can pinpoint. It is that belief that will inform a Mend app update scheduled to roll out in the spring. One sentiment remains: ?It?s true what they say,? Ms. Huerta said. ?Love really is the drug. ?"
17890,Jeffrey Gettleman,24/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"NAIROBI, Kenya  ?   Tens of thousands of civilians dead, countless children on the verge of starvation, millions of dollars stolen by officials, oil wells blown up, food aid hijacked and as many as 70 percent of women sheltering in camps raped  ?   mostly by the nation?s soldiers and police officers. Just a few years ago, South Sudan accomplished what seemed impossible: independence. Of all the quixotic rebel armies fighting for freedom in Africa, the South Sudanese actually won. Global powers, including the United States, rallied to their side, helping to create the world?s newest country in 2011, a supposed solution to decades of conflict and suffering. Now, with millions of its people hungry or displaced by civil war, a radical question has emerged: Should South Sudan lose its independence? As international frustrations and worries grow, some momentum is growing for a proposal for outside powers to take over South Sudan and run it as a trusteeship until things calm down. Several academics and prominent opposition figures support the idea, citing East Timor, Kosovo and Bosnia as places where, they say, it has worked, though of course there are plenty of cautionary tales where outside intervention failed, like Somalia and Iraq. The Ugandan scholar Mahmood Mamdani recently floated a plan in which the African Union would take the lead in setting up a transitional government for South Sudan. Ideally, Mr. Mamdani said, none of the current South Sudanese politicians who have helped drag their nation into civil war would be able to participate, and the trusteeship would last around six years, requiring United Nations support. ?The response to the crisis will need to be as extraordinary as the crisis,? he said. But there is one    problem. Many South Sudanese might not go for it. According to James Solomon Padiet, a lecturer at Juba University, most members of the nation?s largest ethnic group  ?   the Dinka, who include South Sudan?s embattled president, Salva Kiir  ?   are adamantly set against an international takeover. While smaller ethnic groups would welcome it, he said, the powerful Dinka see it as an affront to their sovereignty. For that matter, so does Mr. Padiet, a   scholar who is not a Dinka. He called trusteeship ?offensive? because South Sudan has a potential crop of good leaders waiting in the wings who haven?t had a chance to rule. Still, Mr. Padiet conceded, the country desperately needs help. ?As we speak now,? he said, ?South Sudan is at crossroads of disintegration or total fragility. ? Clashes have spread to new areas of the country, and   militias are mobilizing in the bush. It?s all a staggering plunge from the country?s birth. I, along with hundreds of other journalists, was standing in a crowd that felt like a million people on July 9, 2011, the insanely hot day when South Sudan broke off from Sudan. The sense of pride, sacrifice, hope and jubilation will be hard to forget. For decades, South Sudanese rebels had battled the     central government of Sudan. They fought in malarial swamps and on sweltering savannas, incredibly hostile environments where it?s hard to survive, let alone wage a guerrilla war on a shoestring. The South Sudanese had absorbed bombings and massacres. The Arabs stole their children and turned them into slaves. As a result, many South Sudanese were scattered across the four corners of the earth  ?   the famous Lost Boys, but also many Lost Girls, ripped from their families and forced to flee to cold foreign places that they had never envisioned. On independence day, South Sudan?s capital, Juba, partied until dawn. Lost Boys swigged White Bull (the local beer) next to hardened guerrillas bobbing their heads to reggae rap. All around us, there seemed to be a real appreciation of what had been achieved and what lay ahead. Most important, there was unity. That crumbled quickly, undermined by old political rivalries, ethnic tension and a greed for South Sudan?s one main export: oil. The fault line was the most predictable one, the Dinka versus the Nuer. The two biggest ethnic groups had alternated between allies and enemies throughout South Sudan?s liberation wars. Starting in December 2013, after a breakdown between their political leaders, who not so long ago had been hailed as heroes, Nuer and Dinka militias began killing each other and civilians across the country, especially in ethnically mixed areas. Women were raped. Children were burned to death. Some people were even forced at gunpoint to eat the flesh of their dead relatives. The horror has been meticulously documented. Still, it goes on. For years, the United Nations has stationed thousands of peacekeepers in the country, but often they have not intervened. In 2012, shortly after independence, I rushed to a remote town, Pibor, where hundreds had just been massacred by an ethnic militia. I saw one woman who was literally holding her arm together  ?   she had been blasted by a Kalashnikov  ?   as she sat in a medical tent that smelled of decaying flesh. She stared at the wall, not making a murmur. I interviewed peacekeepers who told me how they had watched civilians get shot right in front of them, yet the peacekeepers felt too scared to raise their rifles. United Nations officials in Juba have been excoriated for failing to spring into action and effectively step between Mr. Kiir and Riek Machar, the former vice president and the most influential Nuer, as their rivalry intensified and grew into nationwide bloodshed. This is a big reason some people think an international trusteeship will never work. ?Having completely failed in the international   project, now we?re going to move to an international takeover? With what army?? asked John Prendergast, who has been working on South Sudan for 30 years and   the Enough Project, an   group. ?Would the same international bureaucrats that undertook massive   experiments in Iraq and Afghanistan come to Juba to lead another failed political intervention?? he added. ?It all seems fantastical, doomed and extremely unlikely. ? Other scholars take a middle view. Amir Idris, chairman of Fordham?s African and   studies department and a frequent writer on South Sudan, said an international trusteeship should be considered  ?   but only as a last resort. He says the most important issue is that a new government be built with new people, including academics and technocrats. ?South Sudan has no chance of transitioning itself to a functioning state unless the edifice of the current leadership is brought down,? he said. Bronwyn Bruton, the deputy director of the Africa Center at the Atlantic Council, called South Sudan?s leaders ?such a disaster. ? She said Mr. Kiir and Mr. Machar were ?corrupt,? ? ? and ?willing to stoke ethnic conflict and commit horrible violence in pursuit of power. ? ?Genocide is beginning to look inevitable,? she said. ?The situation could hardly be more hopeless. ? But she worries that no country has the appetite to spearhead a meaningful intervention. The Obama administration considered several ways to help usher in a political transition, a former administration official said, but eventually concluded it was not feasible. It?s not as if Mr. Kiir or Mr. Machar or their inner circles, who are widely believed to continue to profit from oil and conflict, are going to volunteer to step aside. Thousands of armed men are intensely loyal to them, and even a few friends left in Western capitals make the case that the South Sudanese government has stabilized Juba in recent months, has become more inclusive and should be allowed to stay. One glimmer of hope comes from across the continent. In the last few days, troops from several West African countries banded together to eject Gambia?s president, who tried to stay in power illegally. If such resolve was demonstrated in this part of Africa, then maybe, the interventionists argue, South Sudan?s leaders could be pushed aside and the country would be allowed to breathe."
18263,Neil Genzlinger,3/02/2017,2017,2,politics,"Until the Trump presidency became a reality, the main order of business in any review of ?24: Legacy? would have been to assess whether the franchise is still viable without Jack Bauer, Kiefer Sutherland?s memorable counterterrorism operative, as its lead character. Now, though, and especially given the events of the past week, it?s the show?s chosen villains, not its hero, who demand attention. That?s because a good number of them speak in foreign accents, and some embody President Trump?s bogyman of the moment, the radical Muslim terrorist. This round of ?24? begins Sunday night on Fox after the biggest   television can offer, the Super Bowl, and the first thing viewers will see is foreign terrorists ransacking a home whose owner, an Army Ranger, is tied to a chair and covered in blood. The intruders have already killed his wife and child. ?This is for Sheik ? one of them says before shooting the ranger in the head. The premiere was filmed back when it seemed unlikely that Mr. Trump would be elected  ?   it was screened in New York on Nov. 7  ?   but the opening moments play as if they were scripted to support the immigration restrictions he imposed last week. The series grows considerably more layered as it goes along, with the panoply of villains encompassing a variety of demographics, yet the choice of a bin Laden surrogate as the starting point is sure to reignite the debate over the demonization of Muslims that ?24? has encountered before. The new hero is Eric Carter (Corey Hawkins of ?Straight Outta Compton?) who led the squad of Rangers who killed   preventing a devastating attack on the United States. For their safety, the Rangers involved were given new identities and   jobs, but Eric quickly discovers that all but he and Ben Grimes (Charlie Hofheimer) an unstable fellow, have been tracked down and killed. The men hunting the Rangers, we learn, are interested less in revenge than in something taken during the   raid. The signature ?24? format  ?   each episode represents an hour in real time  ?   is as   as ever. One ingredient that has more or less disappeared, at least in the first four episodes, is the use of torture as a reliable way to get information, a frequent target of ?24? critics. But while Jack Bauer?s violent tactics were repellent, the inner darkness they suggested gave the character a certain complexity. He could show fatherly concern about his daughter one minute and draw blood from a bad guy the next. Eric Carter isn?t as complicated or, as a result, as memorable, at least in the early going, though, by the fourth hour, the character has begun to gain traction. The new story branches quickly into multiple threads in classic ?24? fashion, briefly visiting a high school that might be linked to a sleeper cell and also setting up possible romantic entanglements. Before pursuing his enemies, Eric drops off his wife, Nicole (Anna Diop) for safe keeping with his brother, Isaac (Ashley Thomas) a heavily armed drug dealer whom she used to date. (All three characters are black, and yes, it seems fair to ask why the show couldn?t have a black hero without making his brother a stereotypical black gangster.) And, of course, there is the   Unit, C. T. U. with its skilled staff and interoffice intrigues. The job of filling the   void left by Chloe, the analyst played so appealingly in the original series by Mary Lynn Rajskub, appears as if it were going to fall to Mariana (Coral Pe?a) who also has plenty of attitude and ability. She isn?t used enough early on, but presumably the role will grow. The crisis catches the unit at a moment of leadership change: Rebecca (Miranda Otto of ?Homeland?) is stepping down as national director to allow her husband, John (Jimmy Smits) a senator, to run for president. (It?s a ?24? rule that a president, potential president or past president must be involved in the  .) Mr. Smits has big shoes to fill  ?   the past ?24? presidents played by Dennis Haysbert and Gregory Itzin were two of TV?s standout characters in the first decade of this century. Mr. Smits, like Mr. Hawkins, gets off to a slow start, but, by the fourth hour, is becoming interesting. So aside from Jack Bauer, all of the standard ?24? elements are in place, including the   look. Yet the terrorism aspect, for now at least, overshadows all. It should be noted that, at least in the first four episodes, the link between  ?s followers and Islam is merely implied, but there?s no doubt who and what are being invoked. (A different subplot involves a radical mosque.) Previous seasons of ?24? spread the nefariousness around  ?   villains included the Chinese, the Russians, Mexican drug cartels, American politicians and more  ?   and ?24: Legacy? aims to be an   demonizer, too. Not all of the venal characters here have brown skin or foreign accents, and, in one thread,   bigotry, not radical terror, is the problem. Broadly speaking, however, the world of ?24: Legacy? is one in which Islam equals terror radical Muslim operatives are everywhere and no one can be trusted. Yes, the series is fiction, and yes, most TV viewers can distinguish between entertainment and reality. But the stakes for this ?24? seem weightier than for most previous versions, because two things are more evident now than they were the last time we saw Jack Bauer. One is that certain people, including some now working in the White House, can?t, or won?t, separate the real from the fake when it supports their interests or beliefs. The other is that an insidious part of human nature thrives on having somebody to hate."
18404,Aurelien Breeden,8/02/2017,2017,2,crime,"PARIS  ?   Former President Nicolas Sarkozy has been ordered by a judge to stand trial on charges of illegally financing his failed 2012   campaign, the Paris prosecutor?s office said on Tuesday, the latest impediment for a politician who not long ago was hoping for a comeback. Mr. Sarkozy, 62, a mercurial   politician who was president of France from 2007 to 2012, has denied any wrongdoing. His lawyer said he would appeal the decision, after which the case would be referred to another court for a final ruling. Mr. Sarkozy, who could face up to a year in prison and a fine of 3, 750 euros, or about $4, 000, is out of the running for presidential elections this spring after a poor showing in a November primary for the center and right candidates, and he no longer leads the   Republican Party. His diminished role in French politics would limit the fallout from a trial, but the judge?s decision comes amid growing anger against the political establishment and reflects increased scrutiny of its financial and personal arrangements. Mr. Sarkozy would be the second French president since 1958 to go on trial for a financial scandal. Jacques Chirac, who was president from 1995 to 2007, was given a suspended sentence in 2011 after being convicted of embezzlement and misuse of public funds when he was mayor of Paris. More recently, Christine Lagarde, a former economy minister for Mr. Sarkozy who went on to head the International Monetary Fund, was convicted in December of negligence for misusing public funds, but the court did not impose a fine or a sentence. Fran?ois Fillon, Mr. Sarkozy?s former prime minister and the Republican presidential candidate, is bearing the brunt of the current outrage after revelations that he used taxpayer money to pay family members for parliamentary work that might not have been genuine. In Mr. Sarkozy?s case, the prosecution asserts that he knowingly authorized his 2012 campaign to surpass the strict spending limits set by French law. At the time, the limit for presidential campaigns was about $18. 6 million per candidate in the first round of the elections, and about $5 million on top of that in the second round for the two top   who included Mr. Sarkozy. The Paris prosecutor?s office said on Tuesday that Mr. Sarkozy was suspected of spending at least $45 million, nearly twice the limit, and that he had ignored warnings from his campaign accountants. The case against Mr. Sarkozy is part of what is known as the Bygmalion affair, named for the public relations company suspected of issuing false invoices to Mr. Sarkozy?s party in 2012 for events that were actually for his presidential campaign. The prosecution asserts that the goal of the fraud was to hide the overspending by Mr. Sarkozy?s campaign from the electoral authorities. Mr. Sarkozy has repeatedly denied being aware of any false billing, and the prosecutors have not charged him with wrongdoing in that regard. Instead, the charges of illegal campaign financing relate only to the overspending, for which he has already paid a fine. Thirteen other people  ?   including former party officials, aides close to Mr. Sarkozy and former executives at Bygmalion  ?   were also ordered to stand trial on charges of involvement in the fraud, the prosecutor?s office said on Tuesday. Thierry Herzog, Mr. Sarkozy?s lawyer, noted in a statement that the decision was signed by only one of the two judges investigating the case, a potential sign of uncertainty about the evidence. ?The clear disagreement between the two magistrates in charge of the matter is such a rare event that it is worth underlining,? he said, ?as it illustrates the inanity of the decision. ? Mr. Sarkozy tried a political comeback last year, steering his presidential primary campaign rightward and hoping that the French electorate would look past his legal entanglements. But he was knocked out of   presidential primaries in November. Mr. Fillon was recently embroiled in legal problems of his own, after revelations in the French news media that he used taxpayer money to put his wife and children on the payroll, ostensibly as parliamentary aides. The revelations are especially damaging for Mr. Fillon because he has portrayed himself as a virtuous politician, who, unlike his opponents  ?   Mr. Sarkozy primarily  ?   was untainted by legal scandals. ?There is no point in talking about authority when you are not yourself irreproachable,? Mr. Fillon said in August during the primary campaign. ?Who can imagine for a single moment General de Gaulle placed under formal investigation?? he added, a clear swipe against Mr. Sarkozy. Mr. Fillon has denied any wrongdoing and has vowed to stay in the presidential race, despite opinion polls showing that he is no longer the favorite and might not advance to the second round of the elections."
17663,"Hannah Berkeley Cohen, Azam Ahmed and Frances Robles",14/01/2017,2017,1,business,"HAVANA  ?   Andr?s Ivÿn and his girlfriend grew up in Cuba but had long planned their future in the United States. She left four months ago to find work and made it to Miami, where she was legally welcomed. He stayed in Havana, knowing the United States? special treatment of Cubans gave him the freedom to rejoin her and marry when the moment was right. Those dreams were dashed on Thursday, when President Obama announced the immediate end of the longstanding policy under which any Cuban who made it to American soil was admitted and placed on a glide path to citizenship. ?Our relationship has been built on two things: love, and the idea that we will create a life together in the U. S.  ?   whether that?s in one year or five,? Mr. Ivÿn said here on Friday. ?Now I have to realign my entire life plan. ? He is among an untold numbers of Cubans doing so, including what could be thousands stranded midjourney, whether by boat or by land, often through Mexico. Those who arrived at border stations in Arizona, California and Texas on Thursday were let in. Those still on the Mexican side were left to consider whether to try to sneak across or hire smugglers to take them into a country that as of Friday would treat them as illegal entrants, just like those from other countries. Alexander Iglesias Rodr­guez, 41, a veterinarian who reared cows in Cienfuegos on Cuba?s southern coast, left the country on Wednesday, six weeks after his wife and his son, Gabriel, 16. They flew to Mexico and then crossed the border in Matamoros. He delayed his departure so as not to draw attention from immigration authorities in Cuba and Mexico. He sold his 1956 Pontiac, his   head of cattle and his   house, pulling together about $12, 000. He was in Mexico about to cross into the United States when the order came down. ?So many years dreaming about this,? Mr. Iglesias said. Now he is in limbo, unsure if he should wait or make a stab at seeking asylum in the United States, a request the government does not always grant. ?What do I have in Cuba? Nothing. My wife is in the United States. My son is in the United States. I sold everything I had. I can?t go back. ? Also eliminated on Thursday was a program that allowed Cuban doctors posted to other countries to more easily migrate to America, leaving Ayme Monges, 25, stuck in Bogotÿ, Colombia, on Friday with all her paperwork in order but nowhere to go. ?I got to the embassy this morning and they said, ?You are Cuban? You can?t pass. That program is frozen,?? Dr. Monges, who had been working in Venezuela, said in a phone interview. ?I am stranded here in this country. ? The number of Cubans leaving for America has surged since the two governments resumed relations in late 2014, in expectation that the policy  ?   known as ?wet foot, dry foot? because those caught at sea were sent back but those who made it to dry land were allowed to stay  ?   might end. A senior official with the Department of Homeland Security, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in keeping with agency policy, said the administration decided to end the program immediately to prevent a mass exodus that would risk lives at land and sea. In Cuba, the abrupt change seemed to further divide people along generational lines. Many older Cubans said the decision was a just one that would halt the steady drain of the nation?s citizens  ?   especially educated ones like doctors  ?   to America. One man, selling copies of the   newspaper Granma on the street, said the measure was necessary to stop ?undermining the Cuban government? by enticing people to ?throw their fates to the sea. ? But younger Cubans, for whom the prospect of a life in America offers a glimmer of hope amid economic hardship, were crushed, forced to envision a future with fewer options. Cuban identity, and pride, is in no small part forged by its relationship with the United States, both in the tiny country?s defiance of its bigger neighbor and then in the unique privileges afforded to those who fled and made it to America. To be suddenly placed on equal footing with the millions of others around the world hoping to do the same was an especially hard fall. In Havana, where until recently the internet has been out of reach for most ordinary Cubans, the city?s relatively new   parks have become stations of despair following the announcement. For a nation robbed of connectivity for more than a decade, the sudden surge of digital news  ?   through email, messaging and social media  ?   seemed like a particularly cruel way to find out their special treatment had ended. A few blocks from the American Embassy, in the neighborhood of Vedado, the casual atmosphere changed suddenly as the news began to spread. Visitors checking their phones shared the news with those within shouting distance. One youth yelled to the gathered crowds: ?Have you heard? This screws up all your lives. ? Miguel Alberto Escalona, 24, sat with his wife in a park in Vedado, bewildered. He sent a text to his family in Miami decrying the change. The news also brought to the surface frustrations for young Cubans, especially concerning the new dynamic that an increase in tourism is bringing to the nation. Food prices have surged to meet the demand, while what scant resources the country are redirected to the   outsiders now flooding Cuba, especially Americans. ?I?m totally against the change in the law,? Mr. Escalona wrote to his family. ?Here in Cuba, we have nothing to live for. Our country is for foreigners, not for our people, no wonder people want to leave. ? For years, most Cubans have been willing to overlook that the policy was unfair to other nationalities, especially to Central Americans, many of whom were fleeing violence at home. But for many on Friday, having had the policy and suddenly losing it was somehow worse, especially if you were in the midst of planning an escape. One young man, who was building his own boat to take to America, sat in the Vedado park, stunned. He said he was nearly finished with the boat, and his departure had been imminent. Those plans now dashed, he began browsing the web for a prospective bride, suggesting he would pay up to $3, 000 to any woman willing to marry him and bring him to the United States. ?My plan A was to leave in a boat,? he said with a rueful smile. ?So I guess my plan B is to marry an American woman. ? While Mr. Obama?s announcement was met with chagrin among some groups in Cuba, the government applauded the change in American policy, which they have long complained about, especially the program allowing Cuban doctors to immigrate to the United States. Since the program began 10 years ago, nearly 10, 000 Cuban medical professionals have been approved for residency in the United States. Many of them were Cuban doctors sent on medical missions to friendly countries like Venezuela, a program that critics of the Cuban government likened to human trafficking, since the government took in billions of dollars a year in fees from the doctors? host countries. For those without a career path, the loss of an American escape hatch left them with even fewer employment options. It struck especially hard on those, like Mr. Ivÿn, with deep ties to family and loved ones in the United States. (He declined to be identified by his full name for fear of reprisal by the Cuban government.) His brother made the trek four years ago, through Mexico, and is now living the American dream: a mortgage, a car and a job that pays him a living wage. Now, Mr. Ivÿn is left with a   remorse for having not acted sooner. And he wonders if he will ever be reunited with his girlfriend. On Friday morning, he was even having trouble reaching her, given the   communication in Cuba. He checked his phone incessantly, hoping for a text from her. ?With each blow like this, I feel farther and farther away from you,? he typed to her, frustrated about the shaky   connection. Accepting the reality of the new situation, and without a plan, he sent another message: ?I want you to know that no matter what happens, I will always love you. ?"
17498,Robert Pear,10/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"WASHINGTON  ?   The speed of Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act has stunned health industry lobbyists, leaving representatives of insurance companies, hospitals, doctors and pharmaceutical makers in disarray and struggling for a response to a legislative quick strike that would upend much of the American health care system. The Senate is expected to take the first step by Thursday morning, approving parliamentary language in a budget resolution that would   a repeal bill that could not be filibustered in the Senate. House and Senate committees would have until Jan. 27 to report out repeal legislation. Health insurance and health care for millions of Americans are at risk. But far from reflecting the magnitude of the moment, the most prominent message from lobbyists that lawmakers saw in their first week back at work was a narrowly focused advertisement from the U. S. Chamber of Commerce demanding the repeal of ?Obamacare taxes,? especially an annual fee imposed on health insurance companies to help pay for the expansion of coverage under the health law. ?More than 20 million people could lose their health insurance, and states could lose billions of dollars in Medicaid money,? said Kenneth E. Raske, the president of the Greater New York Hospital Association. But, he added, many health care executives ?don?t want to get on the wrong side of the new administration or the Republican majority in Congress. ? Health care professionals are not totally silent, but industries that were integral to the creation of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 are keeping their voices down as Republicans rush to dismantle it. Some Republican lawmakers are openly fretting about their leaders? repeal strategy, saying they must develop an Affordable Care Act replacement before they repeal it. Five Republican senators proposed on Monday to extend the deadline for drafting repeal legislation by five weeks, until March 3. One of the five, Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, said the extra time would allow Congress and the Trump administration to ?get the policy right? as they try to arrange a smooth transition to a new system of health coverage. But the naysayers are getting no cover from a major lobbying and advertisement blitz like the ones that blanketed the airwaves in 2009 and 2010. To block the repeal effort, said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, ?we need two or three Republicans to join us. ? Doctors are telling Congress to proceed with caution, insisting that no one should lose coverage. The American College of Physicians, representing 148, 000 specialists in internal medicine, has sent letters to senators urging them to ?vote no? this week on the budget resolution. Hospitals were expecting to receive tens of billions of dollars in additional revenue for treating people who were newly insured under the health law, and they are alarmed at the prospect that it may now be repealed. But, they say, if Congress goes ahead and rolls back the expansion of coverage, it must also restore tens of billions of dollars that the health law cut from Medicare payments to hospitals. Top executives from state hospital associations will fly to Washington this week to develop their strategy. Many also plan to visit offices on Capitol Hill, where they will warn of the potential damage if Congress repeals the health law without guaranteeing similar coverage for those who would lose it. A coalition of consumers and liberal advocacy groups is spending more than $2 million on television advertisements urging Congress to stop its attack on the law. The ads, by the Alliance for Healthcare Security, are aimed at a handful of Republican senators, including Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Jeff Flake and John McCain of Arizona, Susan Collins of Maine, Dean Heller of Nevada, Lamar Alexander and Mr. Corker of Tennessee, and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia. But by Washington standards, that is a pittance. Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, an industry lobbying group, set aside $150 million in 2009 to support the law?s passage. Some lobbyists have tacitly accepted the likelihood that major provisions of the health law will be repealed, setting their sights instead on shaping its replacement. They fear that if they come out strongly in opposition to repealing the law, they will lose their seats at the table as congressional Republicans and the Trump administration negotiate a replacement. For now, passage of the budget resolution this week looks likely. The real fight is expected to come two to three weeks from now, when two House committees and two Senate committees produce legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act and must answer to Republicans who say a replacement measure must be ready at the same time. At least a   Republican senators have expressed doubts about the Republican leadership strategy of using the budget resolution to   legislation to repeal the law, with a delayed effective date to allow time to find a replacement in the future. ?Repeal and replacement should take place simultaneously,? Mr. Corker said last week. Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas said on MSNBC, ?It would not be the right path for us to repeal Obamacare without laying out a path forward. ? Members of the   House Freedom Caucus are also pressing leaders to embrace a replacement bill before they eviscerate the existing law. And that concern is not confined to Congress. Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio, a Republican, has also warned Congress against repealing the law without a replacement. What, he has asked, will happen to the 700, 000 people who have gained coverage under the expansion of Medicaid in Ohio? Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, said that he spoke on Friday with   Donald J. Trump, and that Mr. Trump agreed a replacement measure must be ready. ?I think he consistently has said, and I think many people who look at this say, ?Gosh, you?re going to repeal this huge, dramatic thing and not have a replacement on the same day? ?? Mr. Paul said on Monday. ?I mean, doesn?t make a lot of sense to do that. ? Many of the lobbyists who might have slowed the process appear flummoxed, in part because they were expecting Hillary Clinton to win the election. Some companies, anxious about changes in health policy, said they were afraid to speak out because they feared that Mr. Trump would attack them on Twitter, as he has badgered Boeing, Ford, General Motors, Lockheed Martin and Toyota. Marilyn B. Tavenner, the chief executive of the leading lobby for insurers, America?s Health Insurance Plans, is in a particularly awkward position. As an Obama administration official from 2010 to 2015, she led work on the health law, issued rules to carry it out and often defended it on Capitol Hill. In December 2015, Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin pointed to her as an example of how federal officials passed through a revolving door to work for companies they once regulated. ?If the insurance industry does not understand how Obamacare works, why not hire the person who ran it?? Mr. Ryan said in a gibe at Ms. Tavenner that drew laughter from his audience at the Library of Congress. Ms. Tavenner said the requirement for people to have insurance  ?   the individual mandate  ?   was likely to be eliminated. But, she said, to stabilize the market, Congress should maintain ?subsidies for   and   individuals to purchase insurance and financial help for plans that enroll   individuals, through at least Jan. 1, 2019. ? She is also asking Congress to kill the tax on insurers, which has already been suspended for 2017. Kaiser Permanente, the managed care company that serves more than 10 million people, declined to comment specifically on Republican plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Instead, it offered a statement of general principles saying that people should have access to health care and that ?we must continue to accommodate those who have   conditions. ? George C. Halvorson, a former chief executive of Kaiser Permanente, said insurers were guarded in their comments because the current environment was ?extremely politicized. ? He predicted they have more to say when Congress turns to the task of devising a replacement for the law. ?You need to make your point when it will have optimal impact,? Mr. Halvorson said. Lobbyists for the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association have been more active and outspoken. They support changes to the health care law because, they say, premiums and deductibles are too high and commercial insurers have been dropping out of the public insurance marketplaces.   of counties in the United States have only one insurer offering coverage in the marketplace, they say, and in many cases, it is a Blue Cross plan. But Blue Cross lobbyists expressed alarm that Congress or a federal court might eliminate the   subsidies that the government pays insurers to reduce    costs for   people. Without these payments, Blue Cross wrote in a primer delivered to congressional offices, consumers will see ?significant premium increases in 2018, making coverage even more unaffordable for millions of working Americans. ? While defenders of the Affordable Care Act try to figure out a strategy, conservative groups are pressing hard for full repeal of the law as soon as possible. Among them are Heritage Action for America, an offshoot of the Heritage Foundation, and Freedom Partners, a conservative group backed by the billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch."
18335,Cecilia Kang,6/02/2017,2017,2,lifestyle,"WASHINGTON  ?   In his first days as President Trump?s pick to lead the Federal Communications Commission, Ajit Pai has aggressively moved to roll back consumer protection regulations created during the Obama presidency. Mr. Pai took a first swipe at net neutrality rules designed to ensure equal access to content on the internet. He stopped nine companies from providing discounted   internet service to   individuals. He withdrew an effort to keep prison phone rates down, and he scrapped a proposal to break open the cable box market. In total, as the chairman of the F. C. C. Mr. Pai released about a dozen actions in the last week, many buried in the agency?s website and not publicly announced, stunning consumer advocacy groups and telecom analysts. They said Mr. Pai?s message was clear: The F. C. C. an independent agency, will mirror the Trump administration?s rapid unwinding of government regulations that businesses fought against during the Obama administration. ?With these   tactics, Chairman Pai is showing his true stripes,? said Matt Wood, the policy director at the consumer group Free Press. ?The public wants an F. C. C. that helps people,? he added. ?Instead, it got one that does favors for the powerful corporations that its chairman used to work for. ? Mr. Pai, a former lawyer for Verizon, was elevated by Mr. Trump to the position of chairman after serving as a minority Republican member for the past three years. Known for being a stickler on conservative interpretations of telecommunications law and the limits of the F. C. C. ?s authority, Mr. Pai said he was trying to wipe the slate clean. He noted that his predecessor, Tom Wheeler, had rammed through a series of actions right after the presidential election. Many of those efforts, Mr. Pai argued, went beyond the agency?s legal authority. ?These   actions, which did not enjoy the support of the majority of commissioners at the time they were taken, should not bind us going forward,? Mr. Pai said in a statement released Friday. ?Accordingly, they are being revoked. ? The efforts portend great changes at the federal agency at the center of the convergence of media, telecommunications and the internet. The biggest target will be net neutrality, a rule created in 2015 that prevents internet service providers from blocking or discriminating against internet traffic. The rule, which was created alongside a decision to categorize broadband like a utility, was the tech centerpiece of the Obama administration. On Friday, the F. C. C. took its first steps to pull back those rules, analysts said. Mr. Pai closed an investigation into   practices of the wireless providers   ATT and Verizon.   is the offering of free streaming and other downloads that do not count against limits on the amount of data a consumer can download. If a provider like ATT offers free streaming of its DirecTV programs, does that violate net neutrality rules because it could put competing video services at a disadvantage? Under its previous leadership, the F. C. C. said in a report that it saw some evidence that made it concerned. But Mr. Pai said after closing the investigations into wireless carriers that   was popular among consumers, particularly   households. ?The speed of the ruling and the chairman?s tone are very encouraging for internet service providers,? said Paul Gallant, an analyst at Cowen. ?I think it?s a down payment on net neutrality, with much more to follow. ? Last week, Mr. Pai said he disagreed with the move two years ago to declare broadband a utility. The reclassification of broadband into a service akin to telephones and electricity provided the legal foundation for net neutrality rules. Mr. Pai said he had not decided how he would approach the overhaul of broadband classification and net neutrality rules, but he faces legal hurdles. A federal court upheld the rules last year, and the commission could end up in a lengthy legal battle if he tries to scrap the rules. Mr. Pai will have the help of powerful members of Congress who have promised to attack the classification of broadband as a   service. And he is popular among Republican leaders, including the Senate?s majority leader, Mitch McConnell, who with other members viewed Mr. Pai as a loyal voice of dissent during the Obama years. Mr. Pai, 44, the child of immigrants from India who settled in Kansas, is a fresh face for the Republican Party. Congress could introduce legislation that limits the agency?s ability to regulate broadband providers and enforce net neutrality rules. Also under attack are privacy rules for broadband providers. ?The agency has strayed from its core mission,? said Marsha Blackburn, a Republican representative from Tennessee who oversees a telecommunications and tech subcommittee. She has called for a hearing within two weeks on the F. C. C. agenda under the new administration. Democrats in Congress said they would fight legislation that waters down net neutrality rules. They said Mr. Pai, described as a   student of telecom law, would be a tough adversary, and they face great opposition from Republicans who have promised to prioritize the overturning of net neutrality rules. ?The key here is that it?s already been tested in the courts and the court upheld this,? said Representative Anna G. Eshoo, Democrat of California. ?Ajit Pai is intelligent and genial, but he is not on the side of consumers and the public interest. ? Most troubling to consumer advocates was the secrecy around Mr. Pai?s early actions. That included a decision to rescind the permissions of nine broadband providers to participate in a federal subsidy plan for   consumers. None of the providers currently serve   consumers, but Mr. Pai?s comments could foreshadow a   of the Lifeline   subsidy program. On Monday, the F. C. C. is scheduled to appear before a federal judge to defend its push to curb extraordinarily expensive phone call prices from prison. But it told a judge a few days ago that Mr. Pai disagreed with many aspects of the case. Mignon Clyburn, the sole Democrat of the three sitting members of the F. C. C. warned that the actions would directly harm consumers. ?Rather than working to close the digital divide, this action widens the gap,? Ms. Clyburn said."
18382,Jacey Fortin,8/02/2017,2017,2,business,"Donna Hubbard, a flight attendant who lives outside Atlanta, has no problem speaking forcefully about the issue of human trafficking in the United States. But her voice begins to falter when she talks about her own life  ?   how years of exploitation shattered her confidence and turned her life upside down. ?For many years, I couldn?t talk about being an addict,? she said. ?I couldn?t talk about being imprisoned. I couldn?t talk about getting on my feet, getting my life back, getting my children back. ? She paused to fight back tears. ?I could not talk about that part of me where I was victimized. ? But having realized that airline employees are perfectly positioned to stop human traffickers and their victims in transit, Ms. Hubbard has found her mission: teaching other flight attendants to spot and report cases of human trafficking. The nonprofit organization she joined in 2015, Airline Ambassadors International, trains workers at airlines and airports how to spot, and report, cases of human trafficking. It also delivers humanitarian aid around the world and transports sick children who need medical care. It was founded in 1996 by Nancy Rivard, who was then a flight attendant. ?We just did it on our own as a public service because we had the   personnel,? Ms. Rivard said, noting that the organization began focusing on human trafficking in 2009 and has held 52 training sessions in the United States and abroad since 2011. There were 8, 042 reported cases of human trafficking in the United States last year  ?   the most ever, according to a report released last week by the nonprofit organization Polaris. Most of those came through calls to the National Human Trafficking Hotline, which was established by the federal government in December 2007 and is operated by Polaris in a   partnership. The number of reported cases has been rising every year since the hotline was established. But it is not all bad news, said Bradley Myles, Polaris?s chief executive. ?We don?t necessarily want to give the impression that just because we?re learning about more cases, the crime is increasing,? Mr. Myles said. ?It?s actually possible that the response is getting more sophisticated. ? Encouragingly, he added, more and more of these reports are coming directly from trafficking victims, which suggests a growing awareness among those who need it most that the hotline exists. Ms. Hubbard sees victim outreach as vital to her work, but she is hesitant to give details about her own ordeal. She entered an arranged marriage at 16, she said, but the worst abuses did not start until her early 20s, when she described being ?bought and sold, traded and bartered. ? ?Usually, the traffickers play on people?s ignorance and na?vet?,? she said. ?Traffickers exploit people who are vulnerable. ? That is part of the lesson she imparts to airline personnel, along with practical advice on how to spot people who may be traveling against their will  ?   often young passengers who look disoriented, refuse to make eye contact or act oddly subservient to a traveling companion. American Airlines, Ms. Rivard?s former employer, offers free miles to the volunteers of Airline Ambassadors International. American?s employees already undergo training on human trafficking, led by the Department of Homeland Security, according to a company representative. Ms. Rivard said airlines? existing programs are not enough. She cited instances in which she said airline staff failed to take signs of trafficking seriously, and added that she wished more resources were available to her organization. ?It doesn?t cost much. We try to raise about $3, 000 per training? from individual donors, she said. An Airline Ambassadors International training session in late January in Houston, just before the Super Bowl there, was filled to capacity. ?It was an amazing event,? Ms. Hubbard said. ?I give kudos to the city of Houston and to the agencies that are doing the work on the ground. ? Though human trafficking gets more attention during major sporting events like the Super Bowl, there is little hard evidence  ?   from Polaris or elsewhere  ?   to suggest a major spike in trafficking during large events. ?We don?t think it?s useful to somehow give the impression that there are new victims and new types of trafficking that only happen around that time,? Mr. Myles said, though he added that major events might lure criminals who were already operating in other areas. The Houston Police Department has been revamping its approach to human trafficking for years, said Capt. Dan Harris, of the department?s vice division. It now offers training on human trafficking for officers as well as assistance for survivors. ?We had the processes, the procedures and the relationships already in place,? Captain Harris said. ?The only thing we really did for the Super Bowl was work more hours in order to go after, mainly, the johns. ? While law enforcement agencies and charities work to address the problem on the ground, Ms. Hubbard and other flight attendants plan to keep an eye on things in the air. ?If someone is being held against their will, then a crime is being committed inside my airplane,? she said. ?So it is my responsibility to make sure that these people  ?   whose lives are in my hands while they?re on board my aircraft  ?   are safe. ?"
18170,Barry Meier and Susanne Craig,2/02/2017,2017,2,politics,"In a highly unusual turn of events for a sitting president, a federal judge in Florida on Wednesday ordered a golf resort owned by President Trump to pay $5. 7 million for refusing to refund deposits to members who wanted to resign from the club. In his ruling, the judge said that Mr. Trump, by sending a letter in late 2012 denying access to members who wanted to resign from the Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter  ?   a process that could take years  ?   had set off a contract clause that should have resulted in an immediate refund of their membership fees. Instead, the money was withheld. The decision is the first court judgment against a company owned by Mr. Trump since he became president last month, and underscores that while Mr. Trump has stepped away from the operations of his company, he is certain to remain dogged by legal controversies connected to his business. At his new hotel in Washington, Mr. Trump is suing two celebrity chefs for breach of contract. The two men backed out of the Trump International Hotel development in 2015 after Mr. Trump made inflammatory comments about Mexican immigrants. Separately, the federal government owns the building that houses the hotel, and some legal experts have said that Mr. Trump may be in violation of his lease, which appears to prohibit federal elected officials from leasing the building. And last month, a lawsuit was filed in federal court in Manhattan contending that Mr. Trump had violated the emoluments clause of the Constitution by allowing his hotels and other businesses to accept payments from foreign governments. Mr. Trump has not sold any of his assets, which include golf courses, commercial real estate and marketing agreements. Rather he has handed the operations of his company over to his eldest sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, a move he hopes will reduce the appearance of conflict of interest. Wednesday?s ruling  ?   by Judge Kenneth Marra of Federal District Court in West Palm Beach, an appointee of President George W. Bush?s  ?   calls for the club to pay $4. 85 million in withheld fees to 65 club members involved in the lawsuit, plus an additional $925, 000 in interest and other costs. As a result, those members will receive refunds of $35, 000 to $200, 000, depending on their level of membership in the club. Amanda Miller, a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, said the company planned to appeal. ?At the time Trump purchased the club, it was suffering financially, making it unlikely that these members would ever get back their deposits,? Ms. Miller said in a statement. ?At trial, we presented overwhelming evidence that the plaintiffs? memberships were never recalled and that the plaintiffs had waived this argument during the course of the litigation. ? The dispute at the Jupiter club centered on contracts signed by club members with the facility?s previous owner,  . To join, members paid initiation fees as high as $210, 000, depending on the type of membership that they wanted. But under  ?s rules those deposits were refundable when a member resigned. That process, however, could take years and while members on the resignation list waited for their turn to come up they could still use the club so long as they paid annual fees and other costs like food and beverage minimums. That all changed in 2012 when the Trump Organization bought the Jupiter club. Soon afterward, Mr. Trump sent a letter to members saying that those who wanted to resign were no longer welcome there. ?I do not want them to utilize the club, nor do I want their dues,? the letter read. After club members sued, Mr. Trump testified in 2015 during a pretrial deposition that although he had signed the letter, it was his   son, Eric Trump, who was in charge of policies at the family?s golf courses. ?Eric is much more familiar with this club,? his father said. ?He runs it. ? In his pretrial deposition, Eric Trump testified that nothing had changed and that club members seeking to resign had been allowed to use the club so long as they paid their dues. That claim, however, was disputed at trial last year. One member on the resignation list, Richard Slawson, testified that the club?s membership manager told him soon after the Trumps took it over that the club was  . But he continued to receive $6, 000 bills for annual dues and thousands in minimum charges for food and beverages that were never consumed. ?I couldn?t believe that we were charged that when we were not allowed to use the club,? Mr. Slawson, a Florida lawyer, said in a recent telephone interview. Confronted with such testimony, the younger Mr. Trump during his court testimony backed off his assertions and acknowledged he had been mistaken. ?He made himself our strongest witness,? a plaintiff?s lawyer, Bradley Edwards, said about Eric Trump. ?There was no way to reconcile his prior testimony with his testimony at trial. ?"
17751,"Jennifer Steinhauer, John Schwartz, Emmarie Huetteman and Thomas Kaplan",19/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"Democrats complained mightily about their questions being limited, but the Republicans, who hold the majority, get to set the rules. Four of   Donald J. Trump?s cabinet choices faced aggressive questions, but avoided any major stumbles. Here are 10 highlights: ? Representative Tom Price of Georgia, picked to be health secretary, said repealing the Affordable Care Act would not leave millions without health insurance. ? Mr. Price offered lofty goals for replacing the law but gave few details about the administration?s plans. ? He did not rule out cuts to Medicare or Medicaid. ? Scott Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general and the pick to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, said he disagreed with Mr. Trump?s statement that climate change is a ?hoax,? but hedged when asked how much of it is caused by human activity. ? He defended what he called ?common sense? environmental regulation, arguing that farmers, ranchers and business had been hurt by intrusive federal rules. ? Mr. Pruitt said he would not deny the government?s finding that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are a threat: ?That is a law of the land. ? ? Wilbur Ross, selected to be commerce secretary, had a message for Mexico and Canada: Be ready to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. ? Some Republicans said they were taken aback by Mr. Trump?s threats to impose big tariffs, but Mr. Ross assured them that the   was merely being a good negotiator. ? Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina, Mr. Trump?s choice for ambassador to the United Nations, criticized the international body?s treatment of Israel. ? Ms. Haley said there would not be a Muslim registry in the United States. Mr. Price tried to offer reassurance that the Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act would not leave millions of people suddenly without health insurance, but Democrats challenged him repeatedly on that point. ?One of the important things that we need to convey to the American people is that nobody?s interested in pulling the rug out from under anybody,? Mr. Price said. But Mr. Price gave up few details about Mr. Trump?s plan. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent who ran for president as a Democrat, pressed Mr. Price on whether he viewed health care as ?a right. ? Mr. Price deflected. ?We?re a compassionate society,? he said. ?No, we?re not a compassionate society,? Mr. Sanders shot back, lamenting the United States? treatment of some of its neediest citizens. Mr. Sanders also parsed Mr. Price?s remark that Americans deserved ?access? to   health care. ?I have access to buying a $10 million home,? Mr. Sanders said. ?I don?t have the money to do that. ? Mr. Price, who has faced intense scrutiny and criticism from Democrats over his stock trades while in Congress, found a defender in Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky. ?To question your motives, I think, is insulting,? Mr. Paul said. ?To question whether you?re honest is insulting. ? Democrats have made clear their deep discontent with Mr. Price?s nomination. But one of them, Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, found a silver lining with the nominee, who happens to be an orthopedic surgeon. ?I have never shown a knee, my knee, to any nominee before Dr. Price came to my office,? Mr. Bennet disclosed when it was his turn at Wednesday?s hearing. ?But he gave me some free medical advice and I?m grateful. ? ?How you doing?? Mr. Price chimed in, showing a glimpse of his bedside manner. ?It?s terrible, but I?ll talk to you after it?s over,? Mr. Bennet said. ?It?s not because of you. ? Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, pressed Mr. Price to address Mr. Trump?s pledge that he would not cut Medicare or Medicaid. ?Do you believe he was telling the truth?? she asked. ?I believe so, yes,? Mr. Price said. Ms. Warren went on to ask Mr. Price to guarantee that he would ?safeguard? that pledge and not use his administrative power to ?carry out a single dollar of cuts to Medicare or Medicaid eligibility or benefits. ? Mr. Price did not provide such an assurance. Mr. Pruitt, whose hearing attracted dozens of protesters to the Capitol, defended his   position that excessive government regulation was hurting business and energy development. Mr. Pruitt said his ?first and primary goal? as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency would be ?to return the agency to that core mission of protecting the American people through common sense and lawful regulations. ? He said that ?farmers, ranchers, landowners and   owners have recently felt hopeless, subject to a   torrent of new regulations that only a lawyer can understand. ? ?They fear the E. P. A. and that just shouldn?t be the case,? he said. ?If confirmed, I will work tirelessly to ensure that the E. P. A. acts lawfully, sensibly and with those   Americans ever in mind. ? But several senators challenged him. Lead came up repeatedly in the hearing, and Mr. Pruitt has come under fire for his answers. In an one round of questioning, Senator Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, asked, ?Do you believe there is any safe level of lead that can be taken into the human body, particularly a young person? Mr. Pruitt responded: ?That?s something I have not reviewed nor know about. I would be very concerned about any level of lead going into the drinking water or obviously human consumption, but I?ve not looked at the scientific research on that. ? As the writer Susan Matthews at Slate noted, the E. P. A. says there is no safe level of lead in the bloodstream, though its regulations still allow extremely small amounts of lead in plumbing systems. Mr. Pruitt?s statement led to a strong reaction online: There was also a forceful response among the Democratic members of the Senate in the hearing room. Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois asked incredulously, ?You are seeking to be the E. P. A. administrator and you?ve not looked into the issue of lead in our drinking water supply?? She called that, in the aftermath of the water crisis in Flint, Mich. ?a serious oversight on your part. ? Mr. Pruitt responded that the E. P. A. had power to address problems with lead in water and that the agency should have done more in Flint. ?The E. P. A. has emergency order authority? to respond to incidents of contamination, he said, ?and I think the E. P. A. should step into these situations in a very meaningful way. ? Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, had a feisty exchange with Mr. Pruitt over climate change and ethics. Mr. Markey started out by revealing a bit of daylight between the positions of Mr. Trump and Mr. Pruitt on climate change. Mr. Markey noted that Mr. Trump has called climate change a hoax created by ?the Chinese. ?? Mr. Markey asked whether Mr. Pruitt agreed with the president elect on that point. ?I do not believe that climate change is a hoax,? Mr. Pruitt replied. ?O. K. that?s important for the president to hear,? Mr. Markey responded. Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina, the nominee for United States ambassador to the United Nations, was the subject of rather mild questioning, but that did not mean the hearing was  . ?I am concerned with your lack of foreign policy experience,? said Senator Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland and the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee. But he then praised Ms. Haley for leading the fight to take down a Confederate battle flag from the South Carolina statehouse property. For her part, Ms. Haley pivoted to an issue of central concern to Republicans, and many Democrats: the United Nations? relationship with Israel. ?Any honest assessment also finds an institution that is often at odds with U. S. interests,? Ms. Haley said, noting the body?s 20 resolutions against Israel, more than against Syria, Iran and North Korea. ?This cannot continue,? she said, also criticizing the United States? abstention from the latest such resolution against Israel. ?I will never abstain when the United Nations takes any action that comes in direct conflict with the interests and values of the United States,? she said. She also was asked whether she agreed with sanctions on Russia. ?I think that Russia has to have positive actions before we lift any sanctions on Russia. ? What about a Muslim registry? Nope, Ms. Haley said, not going to happen. Mr. Ross kicked off his confirmation hearing by taking a tough stance on China, describing the country as protectionist. ?They talk much more about free trade than they actually practice,? he said. Mr. Ross?s stance echoed Mr. Trump?s own   approach. The   rankled many by accepting a congratulatory phone call from the president of Taiwan, challenging the   One China principle and heightening tensions with the country before he even takes office. In an unexpected revelation, Mr. Ross admitted he had unknowingly employed an undocumented household worker, a fact he said he discovered while preparing for his Senate confirmation process. Mr. Ross said the employee had presented a Social Security card and a valid driver?s license, both bearing that individual?s name, when hired in 2009. But during a check over the past month, the employee had been unable to provide similar documentation. He fired the employee immediately, he said. ?We did the best that we thought we could do in order to verify the legality of the employment, and it turned out that was incorrect,? Mr. Ross said. During that roughly   period, Mr. Ross said he paid all applicable taxes without incident on that employee, using the Social Security number he had been given."
17643,Mark Landler,16/01/2017,2017,1,business,"WASHINGTON  ?   On Friday, Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia, declared that he did not view Donald J. Trump as a ?legitimate president. ? Mr. Lewis, an icon of the civil rights movement, said he planned to boycott the inauguration, the first he will skip in three decades. On Saturday, Mr. Trump hit back. ?Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results,? Mr. Trump said in a pair of early morning Twitter posts. ?All talk, talk, talk  ?   no action or results,? he added. ?Sad!? While some questioned Mr. Lewis?s assertion, many others expressed indignation about Mr. Trump?s outburst, pointing out the unseemliness of attacking a civil rights leader on the eve of Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Mr. Lewis was one of the original Freedom Riders, beaten by police officers while marching from Selma to Montgomery in Alabama. Others ridiculed Mr. Trump?s characterization of Mr. Lewis?s district, which is majority   and encompasses   of Atlanta, as ?horrible,? ?falling apart? and ?crime infested. ? In fact, Georgia?s Fifth Congressional District includes parts of wealthy areas like Buckhead the world?s busiest airport,   the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Georgia Institute of Technology. Some pointed out that fighting with Mr. Lewis distracted attention from a Senate investigation, announced the day before, that will look at possible contacts between Mr. Trump?s campaign team and Russia. In addition, Mr. Trump?s poll numbers have slipped into uncharted depths for an incoming president, with a Gallup poll released on Friday finding that about half of Americans disapprove of Mr. Trump?s transition effort. Mr. Trump?s feud with Mr. Lewis carried echoes of his attacks on Khizr and Ghazala Khan, the   parents of an American soldier killed in Iraq, after Mr. Khan spoke out against Mr. Trump at the Democratic National Convention. Those attacks were widely viewed to have backfired, and Mr. Trump later modulated his words about the Khans. Mr. Trump himself has experience questioning a president?s legitimacy. He was instrumental in sowing doubts about President Obama?s birthplace. Mr. Lewis, who is 76 and was first elected to Congress in 1987, is one of the few genuinely historic figures on Capitol Hill, revered by Democrats and Republicans alike. Allies of Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama and Mr. Trump?s nominee for attorney general, circulated pictures of him linking arms with Mr. Lewis at the 50th anniversary of the Selma march to fend off accusations that Mr. Sessions was a racist. Nevertheless, Mr. Lewis testified against Mr. Sessions, declaring, ?We need someone as attorney general who?s going to look out for all of us, and not just some of us. ? A few critics, including David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to Mr. Obama, said they disagreed with Mr. Lewis?s statement that Mr. Trump was not legitimate, which he made in an interview with Chuck Todd of NBC News and which will be broadcast on ?Meet the Press? on Sunday. Still, Mr. Axelrod said of Mr. Lewis: ?I honor the man he is. Honesty integrity courage  ?   these are qualities you can?t buy. ? In his interview with Mr. Todd, Mr. Lewis said he believed that the Russians had delivered the election to Mr. Trump. ?You know, I believe in forgiveness,? he said. ?I believe in trying to work with people. It will be hard. It?s going to be very difficult. I don?t see this   as a legitimate president. ? Mr. Lewis is one of a handful of Democratic members of Congress who have announced that they will boycott the inauguration on Friday. Others include Barbara Lee of California, Earl Blumenauer of Oregon, Katherine Clark of Massachusetts and Luis Guti?rrez of Illinois."

The   bullet tore through a civil rights worker?s shoulder, stopping within an inch of his spine. The shotgun blast shattered the car windows of four voting rights activists and gouged the wall of a nearby home. And a fire destroyed voter registration equipment and materials outside the city?s Voter Registration Headquarters, leaving the street strewn with rubble. It was 1963 in Greenwood, Miss. a major battleground in the fight for civil rights, and white officials were playing down and ignoring a series of attacks intended to discourage thousands of   from registering to vote. Claude Sitton, the renowned New York Times correspondent, shot photos and took meticulous notes, exposing the racial violence with his pen and with his lens. Mr. Sitton is best known for his words. But the typewritten letters that he sent, along with his film, to John Dugan, a Times photo editor, reveal that he was also determined to capture history with his camera. He carried a Leica, according to one of his sons, and wrote about light and shadows and underexposed frames. He lamented the gloom inside a crowded black church and the time constraints he faced as he scrambled to report the news and illustrate it at the same time. ?I didn?t have very much time,? Mr. Sitton wrote apologetically, ?and will try to give you a better selection the next time I offer something. ? Yet there is power in Mr. Sitton?s   letters and in the    images he captured on   film in March of 1963. Shown together here for the first time  ?   as part of a weekly series running throughout the month  ?   they offer a firsthand glimpse of life on the front lines of the civil rights movement. In one frame, Robert P. Moses, the field secretary of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, clipboard in hand, pointed to the holes left by the shotgun blast in the wall of a weathered home. In another, the charred detritus of the fire  ?   set by a person or persons unknown  ?   littered the street outside the old voting headquarters. Medgar Evers, the state field secretary of the N. A. A. C. P. addressed a packed voter registration rally at the local African Methodist Episcopal church in what may well be the only photograph taken of Evers by The Times. In another series of images, black women took their seats in a citizenship training school intended to train volunteers to help register black voters, and another woman stacked cans of food in the Sunday school room of a local church. The food was collected in Chicago for hungry black farm workers in Greenwood, who had been denied federal food assistance by white county officials in retaliation for their voter registration efforts.   accounted for 61 percent of the county?s population. Yet only 1. 9 percent of blacks of voting age were registered, compared with 95. 5 percent of whites. The Justice Department, contending that whites were disenfranchising blacks with discriminatory voting laws, filed suit. Justice Department officials also sought a federal court order to prevent the city and county from denying blacks the right to protest, after the police unleashed a German shepherd dog on peaceful marchers and jailed voting rights activists. It was the first time that federal officials had taken such a step, Mr. Sitton noted in his article about Greenwood, which was published in April of 1963. (Only three of the many photographs that he took during his time in Greenwood were published with this article.) But with every step forward, it seemed, there were several steps back. Two months later, on June 12, 1963, an assassin killed Evers in Jackson, Miss. That afternoon, hundreds of   took to the streets in protest. And Mr. Sitton was there with his pen, his notebook and his camera."

The playwright David Henry Hwang is making significant revisions to the script for the revival, incorporating recent discoveries about the relationship between Bernard Boursicot, who was an embassy worker, and Shi Pei Pu, a man whom Mr. Boursicot had believed for years to be a woman. The two were convicted of espionage in 1986. They were pardoned a year later. Mr. Owen, a British actor (?Closer?) will play the diplomat, named Rene Gallimard in the play.

17880,Peter Baker,24/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"WASHINGTON  ?   President Trump upended America?s traditional, bipartisan trade policy on Monday as he formally abandoned the ambitious,     Partnership brokered by his predecessor and declared an end to the era of multinational trade agreements that defined global economics for decades. With the stroke of a pen on his first full weekday in office, Mr. Trump signaled that he plans to follow through on promises to take a more aggressive stance against foreign competitors as part of his ?America First? approach. In doing so, he demonstrated that he would not follow old rules, effectively discarding longstanding Republican orthodoxy that expanding global trade was good for the world and America  ?   and that the United States should help write the rules of international commerce. Although the   Partnership had not been approved by Congress, Mr. Trump?s decision to withdraw not only doomed former President Barack Obama?s signature trade achievement, but also carried broad geopolitical implications in a   region. The deal, which was to link a dozen nations from Canada and Chile to Australia and Japan in a complex web of trade rules, was sold as a way to permanently tie the United States to East Asia and create an economic bulwark against a rising China. Instead, Mr. Trump said American workers would be protected against competition from   countries like Vietnam and Malaysia, also parties to the deal. But some in both parties worry that China will move to fill the economic vacuum as America looks inward, and will expand its sway over Asia and beyond. Monday was a busy day for the new president. In addition to abandoning the trade deal, he ordered a freeze on federal government hiring, except for the military and other security agencies. He reinstituted a ban on federal funding for overseas family planning groups that assist or counsel women seeking abortions. He met with congressional, labor and business leaders. And he promised to cut up to 75 percent of federal regulations. Mr. Trump?s decision to scrap the   Partnership, or T. P. P. reversed a   strategy adopted by presidents of both parties dating back to the Cold War, and aligned him more with the political left. When he told a meeting of union leaders at the White House on Monday that he had just terminated the pact, they broke into applause. ?We?re going to stop the ridiculous trade deals that have taken everybody out of our country and taken companies out of our country, and it?s going to be reversed,? Mr. Trump told them, saying that from now on, the United States would sign trade deals only with individual allies. ?I think you?re going to have a lot of companies come back to our country. ? Mr. Trump may also move quickly to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. He is scheduling meetings with the leaders of Canada and Mexico, the two main partners in that pact, which was negotiated by President George Bush and pushed through Congress by President Bill Clinton. While Nafta has been a major driver of American trade for nearly two decades, it has long been divisive, with critics blaming it for lost jobs and lower wages. But   advocates said that in canceling the Pacific pact, Mr. Trump lost an agreement that had already renegotiated Nafta under more modern rules governing intellectual property, internet access and agriculture, since both Mexico and Canada were signatories. He also undercut Mr. Obama?s   pivot to Asia and, critics said, essentially ceded the field to China, which was not part of the agreement. ?There?s no doubt that this action will be seen as a huge, huge win for China,? Michael B. Froman, the trade representative who negotiated the pact for Mr. Obama, said in an interview. ?For the Trump administration, after all this talk about being tough on China, for their first action to basically hand the keys to China and say we?re withdrawing from our leadership position in this region is geostrategically damaging. ? Some Republicans agreed, but only a few would publicly challenge the president. Senator John McCain of Arizona called the decision ?a serious mistake? that would hurt America. ?It will send a troubling signal of American disengagement in the   region at a time we can least afford it,? he said in a statement. The Obama administration negotiated the trade pact for nearly eight years. Speaker Paul D. Ryan and other congressional Republicans worked with Mr. Obama to pass legislation granting     authority to negotiate it over Democratic objections. But Mr. Obama never submitted the final agreement for approval amid vocal opposition. The agreement, the largest regional trade accord ever, brought together the United States and 11 other nations in a   zone for about 40 percent of the world?s economy. It was intended to lower tariffs while establishing rules for resolving trade disputes, setting patents and protecting intellectual property. Obama officials argued that it benefited the United States by opening markets while giving up very little in return. In particular, it finally brought the United States and Japan, the world?s largest and   economies, together in a   pact. Mr. Trump?s decision was crushing for Japan, where Prime Minister Shinzo Abe spent considerable political capital to get the agreement through Parliament, which ratified it Friday. Just hours before Mr. Trump dispensed with it, Mr. Abe told Parliament that Tokyo would lobby the new administration on the merits of the deal. Japan was the last to join the pact, which would give its manufacturers   access to export markets in the United States and other Asian countries, but would bring its automakers into competition with   countries like Mexico. Mr. Abe became a strong enthusiast after making politically painful concessions on agricultural imports that the United States had sought. China, by contrast, welcomed Mr. Trump?s move, although its leaders will probably relish the moment quietly. Given Mr. Trump?s harsh attacks on China and his appointment of a leading China critic, Peter Navarro, to the new post of trade council director, Beijing is bracing for a potentially combative relationship. Victor Shih, an expert on China?s political economy at the University of California, San Diego, said withdrawing from the T. P. P. would alter America?s image in the region. ?The U. S. will be seen as an unreliable partner both economically and perhaps even in the security arena,? he said. ?While some countries in Asia have no choice but to be close to the U. S. others may begin to look to China. ? China has already sought to capitalize by making a push to complete an alternative pact, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, which aims to unite 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations with Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and India. Australia?s trade minister, Steven Ciobo, said on Monday that other members of the trade pact were exploring whether to create a ?T. P. P. minus one,? without the United States. ?The T. P. P. offers very material benefits for all parties that signed up for the agreement,? he said in an interview. ?It would be a great shame to lose those benefits. Notwithstanding President Trump?s decision, there?s still a lot of merits to capturing those gains. ? If Mr. Trump scrambled coalitions overseas, he did so at home, too. Democrats and labor groups praised his move. James P. Hoffa, general president of the Teamsters union, said Mr. Trump had ?taken the first step toward fixing 30 years of bad trade policies. ? Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen?s Global Trade Watch, said it would ?bury the moldering corpse? of the Pacific deal, though she expressed concern about how Nafta would be renegotiated. Some people emerging from the union meeting with Mr. Trump, who won surprising victories in Midwestern labor strongholds, expressed enthusiasm for both his trade action and his promise to build new roads, bridges and other infrastructure. ?We just had probably the most incredible meeting of our careers,? Sean McGarvey, president of North America?s Building Trades Unions, said. ?We will work with him and his administration to help him implement his plans on infrastructure, trade and energy policy, so we really do put America back to work. ?"
17589,Neil Genzlinger,13/01/2017,2017,1,entertainment,"Each generation apparently must have its own Lemony Snicket adaptation, and today?s    have been given a marvelously tangy one, courtesy of Netflix, that turns the franchise into an   series that becomes available on Friday. Parents: Brace yourselves for a dark turn in your children?s senses of humor and a marked improvement in their vocabularies. The show is called, of course, ?A Series of Unfortunate Events,? and it?s based on the popular books, ostensibly written by Lemony Snicket but in fact written by an actual person, Daniel Handler. The tone of these gothic tales is twisted and gloomy, and in Patrick Warburton this version has found the perfect Lemony to narrate them. He warns glumly that viewers are about to embark on a ?descent into misery, tribulation and dire inconvenience,? and he is not wrong. The story follows three children, the Baudelaires, who, it seems, are orphaned by a fire within the first few minutes. Violet (Malina Weissman) the oldest, is a tinkerer, a sort of young MacGyver. Klaus (Louis Hynes) who is ?a little older than 12,? reads more than any    should. And a special casting prize should go to whoever found Presley Smith, a very expressive infant portraying Sunny, whose preverbal blatherings are not as meaningless as they sound (something we learn from subtitles). The child actors are all quite good, as they have to be  ?   this series is all about tone, and not every young performer could nail the one required here. Things really fall into place, though, when Neil Patrick Harris materializes. It might require a double take to recognize him, as he is rather heavily made up for the role of Count Olaf, the villain of the tale, who becomes the children?s first guardian through questionable means and does not exactly have their best interests at heart. What he does have is a lust for the money they have inherited. Olaf is the role played by Jim Carrey in the 2004 movie version, a portrayal that some critics found excessive and  . In her review of that film in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis wrote of the young actors who portrayed Violet and Klaus that it was ?a wonder they didn?t request oxygen masks after being forced into such close proximity with so much ham. ? Mr. Harris?s performance proves that there?s an art to over the top. His Olaf is just as   even   but somehow not irritating. He seems to be having a wonderful time being wicked, and he invites you, the viewer, to enjoy his enjoyment. The running gag of breaking from the action to explain what various $4 and $5 words mean works beautifully, and the cast surrounding the core players is well chosen (especially Joan Cusack as Justice Strauss, Olaf?s neighbor). The whole enterprise is wrapped in a   look and served with a respect for the ability of young minds to perceive offbeat, incongruous humor, the very quality that made the books so successful in the first place."
18229,Vanessa Friedman,3/02/2017,2017,2,entertainment,"Yet another seismic shift is taking place in French fashion. Riccardo Tisci, the creative director of Givenchy and the designer responsible for redefining the brand Audrey Hepburn built for the Kardashian era, said on Thursday that he was leaving the brand after 12 years. A successor has not been announced. Bernard Arnault, chief executive of LVMH Mo?t Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the French conglomerate that owns Givenchy, said in a statement, ?The chapter Riccardo Tisci has written with the House of Givenchy represents an incredible vision to sustain its continuous success, and I would like to warmly thank him for his core contribution. ? Designer moves have become so common of late they are starting to seem more   than critical. (A brief list of departures, since 2015, include Raf Simons from Dior, Hedi Slimane from Saint Laurent, Alber Elbaz from Lanvin, Alexander Wang from Balenciaga, Consuelo Castiglioni from Marni and, as of last Monday, Clare Waight Keller from Chlo?.) But Mr. Tisci?s amicable divorce from Givenchy, rumors of which WWD reported on last month, could have deeper repercussions. Mr. Tisci had, after all, not only transformed Givenchy into one of LVMH?s most successful brands, but was often held up as a model for the partnership between hot young designer and heritage house. That he was willing to end what appeared to be a happy marriage suggests that the old days of designers staying in place for decades (Karl Lagerfeld has been at Chanel since 1983) may be finally, officially, over. Linda Fargo, senior vice president for fashion and store presentation at Bergdorf Goodman, said, ?I guess destabilization is the new normal. ? When Mr. Tisci joined Givenchy in 2005 the brand was floundering after being led by a quick series of creative directors, including John Galliano, Alexander McQueen and Julien Macdonald. In an interview with The Financial Times in 2011, Marco Gobbetti, the former chief executive of Givenchy, said the brand was ?a mess, without an identity. ? And Mr. Tisci was a    upstart Italian with a gothic sensibility who had barely started his own line. It seemed a surprising match, but Mr. Tisci managed to combine his own   sensibility with a certain French classicism and a dose of emotion to give Givenchy a newfound relevance: He made crosses, skulls and the perfect white shirt make sense. Mr. Tisci was also an early adopter of social media, cognizant of the power that those platforms and influencers would have on fashion. He has 1. 8 million followers on Instagram, and many of his famous friends appear in his posts as often as they do in the front row of his shows. LVMH, which also has brands such as Louis Vuitton, C?line and Fendi in its portfolio, does not break down the performance of individual maisons in its financial results. But the number of employees at Givenchy has more than tripled since Mr. Tisci joined the house in 2005, and sales revenue is believed to have grown to around 500 million euros ($539 million) annually. There are now 72   stores worldwide (compared with seven in 2005) with a Rome flagship set to open this year, and plans for a London store are underway for next year. Last week, LVMH, the world?s biggest luxury group, posted record revenue and profits for 2016, beating expectations because of strong sales in the United States and Europe and a pickup in demand in Asia. ?Riccardo has accomplished everything a designer can do for a brand, clocking a very respectable tenure and creating a fully realized language for them,? Ms. Fargo said. So, why leave? Mr. Tisci said in his statement, ?I now wish to focus on my personal interests and passions. ? But rumors have suggested he may be headed to Versace. It would mean going home to Italy, and to a brand whose unabashed Italian sex and   aesthetic mirrors his own. And Mr. Tisci is close to Donatella Versace (he shocked fashion in 2015 when he featured Ms. Versace, at least nominally a rival designer, in a Givenchy ad campaign). Besides, the suggestion, briefly beloved of the industry, that a designer needs a timeout from the increasingly endless show seasons, which was posited when both Mr. Simons and Ms. Waight Keller left their posts, increasingly seems like smoke and mirrors. After Dior, Mr. Simons took an even bigger job at Calvin Klein, and Ms. Waight Keller is said to be moving to a different brand (Givenchy? ). Perhaps this is the answer. Once upon a time, a designer?s name was on the door, and his or her heart was in building a legacy. Now it is rare that any creatives start their own line. Rather, the biggest jobs involve putting their talents at the service of someone else?s already gilded name. That may be an interesting intellectual and creative challenge for a while, but once achieved, it no longer holds the same allure, and the search for the next test begins. ?This clearly shows that a lot of folks are about change and evolution, and both designers and brands want to be continually in motion,? said Marc Metrick, president of Saks Fifth Avenue. We tend to romanticize ?the designers? and to bestow upon them some sort of mystical, spiritual connection to the houses where they reign, maybe because what they make touches our bodies and can thus transform our lives, maybe because it involves the alchemy of invention or because designers these days have the golden glow of celebrity. But what Mr. Tisci?s move suggests  ?   what all of this may reveal  ?   is another, more parochial, truth: Being a designer is a job like any other. And people change jobs.   Pinault, the chief executive of Kering, suggested when Frida Giannini was ousted from Gucci in 2014 that 10 years was probably long enough for any designer to stay at a brand, and after that it was good to mix things up (10 years also being the number most often chosen as an ideal tenure for a chief executive). At the time, it seemed like a radical idea. It does not any more."
18203,Eric Schmitt,3/02/2017,2017,2,business,"WASHINGTON  ?   The White House on Thursday defended the planning and execution of a Special Operations raid in Yemen on Sunday  ?   the first approved by President Trump since taking office  ?   that left one American commando dead and three others injured, and most likely killed several civilians, including children. Sean M. Spicer, President Trump?s press secretary, offered an unusually detailed chronology of the mission involving members of the Navy?s SEAL Team 6 against the home of a senior Qaeda collaborator. He said it started with a plan submitted by the military?s Central Command in November under the Obama administration and ended with Mr. Trump receiving updates in the White House on Saturday night as the mission unfolded eight time zones away. ?This was a very, very    and executed effort,? Mr. Spicer said. Mr. Trump has justified the risky attack on the heavily guarded house, saying the commandos recovered valuable information, including laptops and cellphones, that could help thwart future terrorist attacks. Military officials said on Thursday that while that could prove to be true, analysts were only just beginning to delve into the materials. Almost everything on the mission that could go wrong did. A Yemeni tribal sheikh said the Qaeda fighters were somehow tipped off to the troops? stealthy advance toward the village  ?   perhaps by the whine of American drones that the tribal leader said were flying lower and louder than usual. The assault force, which also included elite troops from the United Arab Emirates, quickly found itself under intense fire from all sides  ?   even from female combatants who unexpectedly took up weapons from assigned fighting positions  ?   forcing the Americans to call in strikes from helicopter gunships and attack planes. A Pentagon spokesman, Capt. Jeff Davis, denied on Thursday that the mission had been compromised. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump flew to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to be present as the body of the American commando killed in the raid, Chief Petty Officer William Owens, was returned home. It was the first military death on the new commander in chief?s watch. Mr. Spicer insisted on Thursday that the commandos had accomplished their mission, even though ?it is tough to ever use the word ?success? when you know that somebody has lost their life. ? His explanation did not quell calls from human rights groups and at least one Democratic member of the House Armed Services Committee for an investigation into the mission and the allegations of civilian casualties. The Central Command said on Wednesday that civilian casualties were likely and that it was investigating. According to Al Qaeda?s branch in Yemen, the dead include the    daughter of Anwar   the   Qaeda leader who was killed in a targeted drone strike in 2011. Planning for the mission started months ago, Mr. Spicer said. On Nov. 7, the Central Command submitted its plan to the Pentagon for review. The Defense Department approved it on Dec. 19, and the plan was sent to Mr. Obama?s National Security Council staff. On Jan. 6, a meeting of senior Obama security aides, called the deputies committee, recommended that the plan go forward, Mr. Spicer said. Military officials have said that Mr. Obama did not act because the Pentagon wanted to launch the attack on a moonless night, and the next one after the meeting would come after Mr. Obama?s term had ended. On Jan. 24, shortly after taking office, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis read the plan and sent it back to the White House with his support. On Jan. 25, Mr. Trump was briefed by his national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, on the plan and on Mr. Mattis?s endorsement. Mr. Trump summoned Mr. Mattis to dinner at the White House that night, along with Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr. the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Mr. Flynn. Also attending were two of Mr. Trump?s closest advisers, Jared Kushner and Stephen K. Bannon, as well as Vice President Mike Pence and Mike Pompeo, the C. I. A. director. ?The operation was laid out in great extent,? Mr. Spicer said. ?The indication at that time was to go ahead. ? On Jan. 26, last Thursday, Mr. Trump formally signed the memo authorizing the action, Mr. Spicer said. Mr. Mattis and other aides updated the president on the raid throughout the night Saturday, Mr. Spicer said. Members of Mr. Obama?s national security team pushed back Thursday at Mr. Spicer?s description of how the former president had set the stage for the decision. They said the attack had not been approved by Mr. Obama, and that materials left for the Trump team emphasized considerable risks. ?Not what happened,? Colin Kahl, the national security adviser to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. wrote on Twitter after Mr. Spicer?s briefing. Mr. Kahl?s colleagues said that Lisa Monaco, Mr. Obama?s homeland security adviser, told the national security staff in early January that Mr. Obama was not prepared to approve the concept for the raid. Instead, they prepared a memorandum for Mr. Trump?s team that described a variety of options, and underscored the risks."
18139,Daniel Victor,1/02/2017,2017,2,politics,"President Trump on Tuesday night named Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, a federal appeals court judge in Denver, to replace Justice Antonin Scalia on the United States Supreme Court. But there?s a long way to go before the new nominee is confirmed. Judge Gorsuch will immediately face a public and private gantlet of scrutiny, and could end up at the center of fevered political maneuvering. Just 51 votes are needed to confirm him, but one big question looms: Will the Senate Democrats  filibuster the nomination? That would require 60 votes to overcome. Expect the task to drag on for months: Elena Kagan was confirmed 87 days after she was nominated, in 2010 Sonia Sotomayor?s confirmation in 2009 took 66 days, and Samuel Alito Jr. was confirmed 82 days after his nod, in 2006. Events would have to unfold very smoothly for the nominee to be confirmed by April 26, the date of the last scheduled arguments in the current court term, which typically ends in late June. The next term begins in October. Here?s what to expect in the nomination process. The nominee must fill out an elaborate questionnaire, which the Senate will examine. He will be asked to list every client he has ever represented, sources of income, speaking fees, travel destinations, media interviews, writings  ?   everything short of where he went to summer camp. The questionnaire often runs hundreds of pages long. The F. B. I. will immediately begin a background check, and the staff members of senators on the Judiciary Committee will start their own investigations. As others pore over documents, the nominee will be calling and meeting with as many senators as possible. The   meetings typically take 15 minutes to an hour, said Stephen Wermiel, a constitutional law professor at American University. The senators are typically looking to learn about how the nominee thinks and what makes the    tick, while the nominee is trying to learn what concerns the senators might have, Mr. Wermiel said. There will most likely be political jostling over how the confirmation hearing is conducted. Democrats and Republicans will haggle over issues such as when it will occur, how many rounds of questioning will unfold, how long the rounds will last and how many outside witnesses will be allowed. Republicans will likely try to minimize the length of the hearings, Mr. Wermiel said. The nominee will probably undergo mock questioning from advisers in what is known politely as a ?murder board. ? It?s similar to the practice sessions presidential candidates go through with their staff before squaring off in a televised debate advisers try to anticipate the questions that senators will ask. ?Ideally, their goal would be that a nominee goes in there facing no question that he had not already heard in one of those sessions,? Mr. Wermiel said. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. once called the hearings a ?Kabuki dance. ? Justice Kagan called them a ?vapid and hollow charade. ? Nonetheless, the televised hearings will be conducted by the 20 members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is made up of 11 Republicans, including Ted Cruz, Orrin Hatch and Lindsey Graham and nine Democrats, including Dianne Feinstein, Amy Klobuchar and Al Franken. Its chairman is Chuck Grassley, a Republican. There?s an art to the questioning, since nominees must be careful not to take positions on issues that might come before the court. For example, if a nominee directly expressed a preference to overturn Roe v. Wade, the ruling that legalized abortion across the nation, the judge may have to be recused from a future case. So committee members typically ask more roundabout questions, hoping to read the tea leaves about how the nominee?s judicial philosophies would apply to   issues. ?It?s this sort of odd dance in which the Senators are trying to elicit some sense of how the nominee thinks about important constitutional questions, but they can?t really ask the things that they want to ask,? Mr. Wermiel said. Recently, the hearings have lasted for three or four days. Expect the senators to question the nominee for a few days, plus an additional day for outside witnesses. At least a week after the hearings, the committee will vote on sending the nomination to the full Senate. A simple majority is needed, but there?s a twist: By tradition, Supreme Court nominations are sent to the Senate even if the nominee is rejected by the committee. Then it?ll be in the hands of all 100 senators, where Republicans hold a   advantage over Democrats (two independents caucus with the Democrats). Both Democrats and Republicans will have difficult decisions to make with vast political consequences. If the Democrats filibuster the nomination, Republicans would need 60 votes to end the filibuster, requiring some Democrats to join the Republicans. That is, unless Republicans use the   nuclear option, a rare maneuver to end the filibuster. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, has not ruled out the possibility, but is considered to be a strong believer in the traditions of the Senate, including the right of the minority party to filibuster. In 2013, Senator Harry Reid, a Democrat and the majority leader at the time, used the tactic to push through the Obama administration?s judicial and executive nominees. Furious Republicans vowed that Democrats would regret it once control of the Senate flipped. Mr. McConnell was among those who condemned the tactic at the time. But he said in November that any Republican retaliation by using the nuclear option themselves could backfire. ?I don?t think we should act as if we?re going to be in the majority forever,? he said."
17466,Campbell Robertson and Mitch Smith,8/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"COVINGTON, La.  ?   ?Sour grapes,? explained Bob Marino, 79, weighing in on the recent spycraft bombshell from the corner table of a local McDonald?s. ?Sour grapes,? agreed Roger Noel, 65, sitting next to him. ?Bunch of crybabies,? Reed Guidry, 64, offered from across the table. The subject of conversation was the report released by United States intelligence chiefs on Friday informing   Donald J. Trump of their unanimous conclusion that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia ordered an extensive, but covert, cyberoperation to help Mr. Trump win the election. The Russians had hacked and leaked emails, unleashed ?trolls? on social media and used their ?  propaganda machine? to spread stories harmful to Hillary Clinton. In Washington, the report was viewed as extraordinary, both for its timing, raising sharp questions about the  ?s legitimacy on the verge of his taking office, and for its assertions, describing the operation as Russia?s boldest effort yet to meddle with American elections, to spread discontent and to ?undermine the U. S.  democratic order. ? But interviews with Trump supporters here in Louisiana, a state the   won by 20 points, and in Indiana, a state he won by nearly the same margin, found opinions about the report that ranged from general indifference to outright derision. ?From the parts of the report I?ve seen,? said Rob Maness, a retired Air Force colonel who twice ran for Senate here as Tea Party favorite, ?it seems silly. ? There are genuine concerns about Russia?s cyberoperations, he said, but the notion that they changed the outcome of the election was absurd. (The report made no determination on how they affected the election.) Of the comments he had seen from fellow Trump supporters on Facebook and in emails, he added, ?90 percent of them are like, ?What?s the big deal? ?? The Russians may have very well gotten involved, several people said. They added that kind of interference should be combated. But many assumed that foreign actors had long tried to play favorites in American elections, and that the United States had done the same in other countries? elections. Even if the Russians did do it  ?   which some were more willing to concede than others  ?   what difference did it make? People did not need the Russians to make up their minds about Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Trump?s election opponent. Blaming her loss on the Russians was, as one Trump supporter here said, ?just being sore losers. ? ?I don?t think the Russians posed as big a problem to the Clintons as the Clintons posed to themselves,? said Paul Emenes, 49, while he sold ribs, shoulders and chops at a frigid outdoor farmers? market in Covington. Russian hacking was concerning, sure, Mr. Emenes said. He added that, as long as Mr. Trump was not involved himself, ?it doesn?t change the way I view him. ? Tina Gunaldo, 44, taking blankets off the citrus trees in her Mandeville, La. front yard after the previous night?s frost, had a similar attitude. ?Trump is Trump,? she said. ?Do I think he?s going to become more of a friend to Russia because of this? No I don?t. I think  ?   I hope  ?   his focus will be on making America great again. ? Ms. Gunaldo would not reveal whom she voted for, but she did say Mr. Trump?s slogan resonated with her. It apparently resonated quite widely in this parish, which he won by more than 50 points. But it was a quiet support, she said. She knew of only one yard in the whole subdivision with a sign. That yard belonged to Thurston Yates Sr. ?I don?t believe it,? Mr. Yates, 78, said flatly of the intelligence report. He was standing in the yard under his ?Make America Great Again? flag, which he bought at a gun show several months ago. ?Why would Putin even want Trump?? Mr. Yates, who is retired from a career in pharmaceutical sales, was not concerned about what Mr. Trump might do in office, but said he was deeply alarmed about what President Obama might do before he leaves office. It was Mr. Obama who was too soft on Russia, who let Mr. Putin get away with things, Mr. Yates continued. Mr. Trump would be much tougher. But Mr. Yates then added: ?Why is everybody so afraid of Russia? I?m not against Putin. ? This last sentiment was not uncommon. Even among those who were troubled by the hacks, few felt that Russia was a serious threat. The country was ?a basket case,? and not the powerful foe it once was, said Mr. Marino, from his seat at McDonald?s. Others said that North Korea, the Islamic State and China were the real threats. Russia could even be a potential ally in some fights, suggested Valarie Kubacki, 54, a real estate broker in Valparaiso, Ind. Ms. Kubacki said she perceived Russia as ?somewhere in the middle? between friend and enemy, but agreed with Mr. Trump that the United States could work with them to defeat the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. ?We may have to line up with people who may not be our ?friend? to make that happen,? she said. That those on the right seemed to be warming to Russia was not seen as a particularly unusual development, though some joked about the incongruity of the left putting such faith in the Central Intelligence Agency. As they watched their son skate with his Boy Scout group at the public ice rink in downtown Valparaiso, Monty and Mary Willis, both registered Republicans, considered the ramifications of the intelligence report. ?The idea of a fair election? had been placed in doubt, Ms. Willis said. ?We were concerned about money being involved in the election. Now you?re talking about espionage. ? The Willises, who both work in real estate, might be Republicans, but they were not Trump voters. In fact, they had last voted for a Republican presidential candidate in 2008, when Senator John McCain of Arizona ran. The party seemed to have changed in recent years, they said. And the incoming administration had them deeply worried. ?Our president being in cahoots with the Russian government?? Mr. Willis said. ?Yes, I?m very concerned about that. ? In Louisiana, David Gubert, 56,   Eagle 20 cigarettes in the cab of his pickup, with stacks of firewood for sale behind him in the bed. Like the Willises, he ruminated on what it would mean if the Russians had gotten involved, and possibly even swung the election. But Mr. Gubert came to a different conclusion. ?If that?s what it took,? he said, ?I?m glad they did it. ?"
18062,Peter Baker,30/01/2017,2017,1,crime,"WASHINGTON  ?   Travelers were stranded around the world, protests escalated in the United States and anxiety rose within President Trump?s party on Sunday as his order closing the nation to refugees and people from certain predominantly Muslim countries provoked a crisis just days into his administration. The White House pulled back on part of Mr. Trump?s temporary ban on visitors from seven countries by saying that it would not apply to those with green cards granting them permanent residence in the United States. By the end of the day, the Department of Homeland Security formally issued an order declaring such legal residents exempt from the order. But the recalibration did little to reassure critics at home or abroad who saw the president?s order as a retreat from traditional American values. European leaders denounced the order, and some Republican lawmakers called on Mr. Trump to back down. As of Sunday evening, officials said no one was being held at American airports, although lawyers said they believed that dozens were still being detained. More than any of the myriad moves Mr. Trump has made in his frenetic opening days in office, the immigration order has quickly come to define his emerging presidency as one driven by a desire for decisive action even at the expense of deliberate process or coalition building. It has thrust the    administration into its first constitutional conflict, as multiple courts have intervened to block aspects of the order, and into its broadest diplomatic incident, with overseas allies objecting. The White House was left to defend what seemed to many government veterans like a slapdash process. Aides to Mr. Trump insisted they had consulted for weeks with relevant officials, but the head of the customs and border service in the Obama administration, who resigned on inauguration day, said the incoming president?s team never talked with him about it. White House officials blamed what they portrayed as a hyperventilating news media for the confusion and said the order had been successfully carried out. Only about 109 travelers were detained in the first 24 hours, out of the 325, 000 who typically enter the United States in a day, they said. As of Sunday evening, the Department of Homeland Security said 392 green card holders had been granted waivers to enter. That did not count many visitors who remained overseas now unable to travel. Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, said Mr. Trump simply did what he had promised on the campaign trail and would not gamble with American lives. ?We?re not willing to be wrong on this subject,? he said on ?Face the Nation? on CBS. ?President Trump is not willing to take chances on this subject. ? The order bars entry to refugees from anywhere in the world for 120 days and from Syria indefinitely. It blocks any visitors for 90 days from seven designated countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The Department of Homeland Security initially said the order would bar green card holders from those seven countries from returning to the United States. With thousands of protesters chanting outside his White House windows and thronging the streets of Washington and other cities, Mr. Trump late on Sunday defended his order. ?To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting,? he said in a written statement. ?This is not about religion  ?   this is about terror and keeping our country safe. ? He noted that the seven countries were identified by former President Barack Obama?s administration as sources of terrorism and that his order did not affect citizens from dozens of other predominantly Muslim countries. ?We will again be issuing visas to all countries once we are sure we have reviewed and implemented the most secure policies over the next 90 days,? he said. Mr. Trump expressed sympathy for victims of the   civil war in Syria. ?I have tremendous feeling for the people involved in this horrific humanitarian crisis in Syria,? he said. ?My first priority will always be to protect and serve our country, but as president, I will find ways to help all those who are suffering. ? While Mr. Trump denied that his action focused on religion, the first iteration of his plan during his presidential campaign was framed as a temporary ban on all Muslim visitors. As late as Sunday morning, he made clear that his concern was for Christian refugees, and part of his order gives preferential treatment to Christians who try to enter the United States from   nations. In a Twitter post on Sunday morning, Mr. Trump deplored the killing of Christians in the Middle East without noting the killings of Muslims, who have been killed in vastly greater numbers in Iraq, Syria and elsewhere. ?Christians in the Middle East have been executed in large numbers,? he wrote. ?We cannot allow this horror to continue!? His order, however, resulted in a second day of uncertainty at American airports. The American Civil Liberties Union said it was investigating reports that officials were not complying with court orders in New York, Boston, Seattle, Los Angeles and Chicago. New York?s attorney general sent a letter to federal authorities demanding a list of all individuals detained at Kennedy International Airport. The Department of Homeland Security said on Sunday evening that it was ?in compliance with judicial orders. ? Still, at Dulles International Airport outside Washington, even the arrival of four Democratic members of Congress did not prompt customs officers to acknowledge whether they were holding anyone or provide lawyers access to anyone detained. The lawmakers arrived after 3 p. m. and were rebuffed by police officers when they tried to enter the Customs and Border Protection offices at the airport. Representative Gerry Connolly, Democrat of Virginia, said he was told to call the main office of the agency in Washington. His staff got a legislative liaison from the customs service on the phone, and ?they said we?ll put you in touch with the deputy commissioner,? Mr. Connolly said. ?I said that?s not acceptable,? he continued. ?We want to talk to the person in charge of operations at Dulles Airport. That?s where the problem is, and that?s where the federal judicial ruling is applicable. ? The clash over the order provoked emotional responses. At a news conference, Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leader from New York, choked up as he vowed to ?claw, scrap and fight with every fiber of my being until these orders are overturned. ? The mayors of New York, Chicago and Boston spoke out, as well. In Dallas, Mayor Mike Rawlings personally offered regrets to four released detainees at   Worth Airport. ?We have wished them welcome, and we have apologized from the depths of our heart,? he said. Chelsea Clinton joined a protest in New York. The order roiled relations with America?s traditional allies in Europe and the Middle East. The spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said she ?is convinced that the resolute fight against terrorism does not justify blanket suspicion on grounds of origin or belief. ? Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, who met with Mr. Trump in Washington on Friday and has sought to forge a friendship with him, initially declined to comment on the policy on Saturday when pressed by reporters during a stop in Turkey. But under pressure from opposition politicians, her spokesman later said the British government did ?not agree with this kind of approach. ? The matter was especially sensitive in Muslim countries, and Mr. Trump spoke by telephone on Sunday with King Salman of Saudi Arabia and Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi. White House statements on the calls said they discussed the fight against terrorism but did not say whether they discussed the immigration order, which did not include their countries. In Washington, protesters gathered by the thousands outside Mr. Trump?s front lawn to denounce his order and show solidarity with Muslim Americans. ?Shame,? they chanted, hoisting homemade signs toward the executive mansion, where Mr. Trump was scheduled to host a private screening of the movie ?Finding Dory. ? ?No hate, no fear,? they added later. ?Refugees are welcome here. ? Security fencing and reviewing stands still in place from the inauguration prevented the crowd from getting more than a couple hundred yards away from the building, but did not stop crowds from swelling through the afternoon, when protesters departed to march to Capitol Hill. Some Republicans grew increasingly alarmed by the backlash to the order. ?This executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country,? Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said in a statement. ?That is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security. ? Some conservative donors also criticized the decision. Officials with the political network overseen by Charles G. and David H. Koch, the billionaire conservative activists, released a statement on Sunday criticizing Mr. Trump?s handling of the issue. ?We believe it is possible to keep Americans safe without excluding people who wish to come here to contribute and pursue a better life for their families,? said Brian Hooks, a chairman of the Kochs? donor network. ?The travel ban is the wrong approach and will likely be counterproductive. ? Senator Bob Corker, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said the order was ?poorly implemented? and urged the president to ?make appropriate revisions. ? Other Republicans were more circumspect. Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, said the issue would be decided by the courts. Mr. Trump fired back at Mr. McCain and Mr. Graham on Twitter. ?They are sadly weak on immigration,? he wrote. ?Senators should focus their energies on ISIS, illegal immigration and border security instead of always looking to start World War III. ?"
18219,Daniel Victor,3/02/2017,2017,2,law,"A grand jury indicted Ronald Gasser Jr. on Thursday in the fatal  shooting of the former N. F. L. player Joe McKnight, handing down a   murder charge. The charge is more severe than the one that Mr. Gasser had initially faced in December, when critics complained that racial bias may have affected the investigation. If convicted, Mr. Gasser, 54, would face life in prison with no parole. The death of Mr. McKnight, 28, a star running back at the University of Southern California who later played for the Jets and Kansas City Chiefs in the N. F. L. spurred several days of protests. Supporters and Mr. McKnight?s former teammates were outraged after the police initially freed Mr. Gasser. Though the authorities said Mr. Gasser had admitted to the shooting on Dec. 1, he was not arrested and charged until four days later. Mr. Gasser was initially charged with manslaughter over what the authorities described as a ?road rage? confrontation in Terrytown, La. about five miles southeast of New Orleans. ?Subsequent to that arrest, the Jefferson Parish Sheriff?s Office and the Jefferson Parish District Attorney?s Office continued working together in a collaborative effort to develop additional evidence regarding the case,? the district attorney?s office said in a statement Thursday. ?Today?s indictment comes as a result of that joint effort. ? Mr. Gasser?s bond was also increased to $750, 000. The delayed arrest and lesser initial charge had angered critics, who said that Mr. Gasser, the owner of a telecommunications firm and a real estate business, may have been afforded more leeway because he is white, or that the authorities were less invested in swift justice for a black man?s death. In a fiery response after the initial arrest, Sheriff Newell Normand of Jefferson Parish defended the pace of the investigation, saying the authorities needed time to build a better case in a state that has strong Stand Your Ground   laws. Investigators conducted more than 160 interviews and spoke to Mr. Gasser for more than 12 hours, Sheriff Normand said at a news conference in December. ?Justice has no time period,? he said. ?Justice is not a sprint. It is a marathon. These investigations are marathons. ? The confrontation began around 2:45 p. m. after both men were driving erratically, cutting each other off and zipping in front of each other, Sheriff Normand said. Mr. Gasser became irate and engaged in a ?verbal altercation? with Mr. McKnight, the sheriff said. When they stopped next to each other at a red light, Mr. McKnight got out of his car and approached the window of Mr. Gasser?s car, the sheriff said. Mr. Gasser then pulled out a handgun from between his seat and the console and shot Mr. McKnight three times, according to the sheriff."
17430,Simon Romero,16/01/2017,2017,1,crime,"RIO DE JANEIRO  ?   Some of the inmates were beheaded. Others had their hearts torn from their bodies. Gang leaders used the blood of their victims to write a nightmarish message of retribution: ?Blood is paid for with blood. ? The harrowing scenes on Friday from the latest prison riot in Brazil, in which 31 inmates were killed in the northern state of Roraima in the Amazon River Basin, pushed the death toll to 93 in six days of mayhem in penitentiaries around the country. The bloodshed has shocked the country and is emerging as the most pressing crisis facing President Michel Temer, whose beleaguered government was already grappling with graft scandals, a weak economy and simmering anger over austerity measures. ?The bloodshed is revealing a war between drug gangs, a failed prison system and a weak government,? said Rafael Alcadipani, a scholar who specializes in public security policies at Funda??o Getlio Vargas, a leading Brazilian university. ?And now the horror is spreading. ? Prison violence that has spilled out into neighboring communities has been a perennial problem in Brazil. In 2006, street fighting between the police and First Capital Command, a   gang, left almost 200 people dead in S?o Paulo, causing chaos in the city of 20 million people. The killings in Roraima came just days after 56 men were killed in a massacre at a prison in the city of Manaus. In two different riots at prisons this week in the states of Amazonas and Para­ba, six men were also killed. The violence at the Monte Cristo Agricultural Penitentiary in Boa Vista, the capital of Roraima, adds to fears about an intensifying war between drug gangs for control of the cocaine trade in the Amazon region in Brazil. The latest episode is thought to involve fighting between First Capital Command, commonly known by its Portuguese initials, P. C. C. which has roots in the prisons of S?o Paulo in southeastern Brazil, and supporters of Red Command, a drug trafficking organization that has long held sway in Rio de Janeiro. The authorities, however, tried to play down the possibility that warring gangs were to blame. The gangs, which operate inside prisons as well as on the streets of many Brazilian cities, are battling for supremacy over the trade in cocaine smuggled into Brazil across the porous Amazonian frontier from countries like Bolivia, Colombia and Peru. Family of the North, an increasingly influential gang in the Amazon that has allied itself with Red Command, was responsible for the attack at the prison in Manaus, massacring dozens of rivals from the P. C. C. gang. The attack had been planned for months, according to text messages intercepted by intelligence agents. Mr. Temer, the president, has been chided for what some have called a   response to the crisis. He said nothing for two days about the killings in Manaus, before calling them a ?dreadful accident? and seeking to deflect blame from public agencies because a private contractor runs the prison there. Just months after emerging victorious in the battle to impeach his predecessor, Dilma Rousseff, Mr. Temer is grappling with calls from some of his own allies to resign. In an effort to defend himself, he sent a message Thursday on Twitter listing synonyms for the word ?accident?  ?   tragedy, loss, disaster, disgrace and misfortune. Although the Manaus riot has fueled a debate over whether management of some prisons should be handed to private companies, the violence in Roraima casts scrutiny directly on state officials. The Boa Vista prison, which is run by the state, has a long history of deadly riots and inmate escapes. The prison was built for 700 inmates but currently holds about 1, 400. Carlos Paix?o de Oliveira, a prosecutor in Roraima, publicly criticized the management of the facility in October, when inmates from the P. C. C. gang killed at least 10 rivals from Red Command. Mr. Oliveira suggested at the time that the prison should be demolished and replaced. ?If they want, the inmates will carry out a new slaughter in there, because no one has control of that prison,? he said. Despite the writing in blood on Friday proclaiming the supremacy of the P. C. C. the authorities contended that the latest killings did not involve   between gangs but a power struggle within the P. C. C. itself, or an effort to project power by the gang. ?We?ve been on guard about something like this for some time, transferring prisoners from Red Command to other units,? said Uziel Castro, the top security official in Roraima. ?We think this had to do with an internal battle. ? Either way, the scenes from the Roraima penitentiary offered an unsettling reminder of how the bloodshed in the country?s prisons is a problem that has been building for decades, revealing a system hobbled by corruption, overcrowding and mismanagement. Human rights groups compare the current string of uprisings to the Carandiru prison massacre in 1992 in S?o Paulo, when the police stormed the facility and killed 111 inmates. An appeals court recently voided the convictions of 73 police officers for their participation in the killings. The problems in Brazil?s prisons that led to earlier episodes of carnage have intensified with the growing drug trade, security experts say. Brazil?s prison population has swelled this century as the authorities lock up more people on minor drug offenses. Brazil now has a prison population exceeding half a million, with about 40 percent of detainees awaiting trial. Drug gangs that originated in prisons are expanding their sway and battling one another for territorial control of the trade. ?This war between the criminal factions is worsening,? said Antonio Clÿudio Mariz de Oliveira, a former security official in S?o Paulo. ?The problem is largely a result of the lack of attention towards the prison system, both by the government and the public. ? ?People only react when there?s an episode like this,? said Mr. Mariz de Oliveira. ?Then they forget about it until the next one. ? Indeed, some elected officials have expressed the hardened views held by   voters. Jos? Melo, the governor of Amazonas State, said ?there were no saints? among the dozens of inmates killed in the state?s prisons this week, calling the victims murderers, rapists or gang members. At the same time, officials in Mr. Temer?s administration have tried to play down the prison crisis. ?The situation is not out of control,? said Justice Minister Alexandre de Moraes."
18159,Melena Ryzik,3/02/2017,2017,2,entertainment,"It?s almost a coronation: Every year, the Sundance Film Festival anoints a darling or two  ?   indie   who are poised to break out, usually with their first feature. (Geremy Jasper was one at the festival that just ended in Park City, Utah.) These lucky few tend to go on to   or critical success, maybe even the Oscars. Think Damien Chazelle, whose ?Whiplash? was the toast of the 2014 season his ?La La Land? is now the    . But what about the festival filmmakers whose works are lauded and distributed, but whose career paths are less charmed? After they?ve packed up their snow gear, there are tantalizing moments and deep frustrations. Many go on what?s known as the ?water bottle tour,? meetings with development executives and agents in Los Angeles (where you?re more likely to leave with a bottle of Evian than a production deal). Most don?t have new scripts ready, a huge impediment, said the producer Anne Carey. Then they struggle against the industry?s narrow expectations. ?Any person coming out of Sundance is in a box, particularly if you only have one film under your name,? said the filmmaker Justin Simien. ?And if you happen to be in the black box or the gay box or the woman box, I think you?re in a smaller box. ? Meanwhile, the clock is ticking: ?You have a whole year, and then there?s a whole new batch of kids at Sundance, and then it?s their year,? said the director Kat Candler. ?Your spotlight has shifted. ? For three filmmakers  ?   Mr. Simien, 33, from Los Angeles Ms. Candler, 42, who lives in Austin, Tex. and Sara Colangelo, 37, based in New York  ?   who made their feature debuts in 2014, alongside Mr. Chazelle, what happened next felt like one step forward, two back. Their paths hold lessons for other artists and offer a glimpse into how Hollywood careers are really made. 2014 Two years before, Justin Simien quit his day job to make his debut feature, ?Dear White People. ? He had worked in movie marketing, so he had some insider savvy. What he didn?t know was how his film, a satire of race relations set on a college campus, would be received by the mostly white audiences at Sundance. ?I was kind of terrified, to be honest,? he said. ?Dear White People? struck a chord, earning a festival award for breakthrough talent. A distribution deal soon followed. ?I went into it just hoping that when I came out, I could at least pay my rent,? Mr. Simien said. ?That didn?t happen. ? But in Los Angeles afterward, he was in demand, attending dozens of development meetings for months. He understood the process: ?Part of being a development person is checking off the list? that you?ve met with Sundance alumni, he said. Nonetheless, it seemed like he had arrived. Even if the offers were not as big as those some of his white counterparts were getting  ?   ?Nobody was talking about ?Jurassic World,?? he said, the film Colin Trevorrow landed after his Sundance debut  ?   he didn?t feel pigeonholed. Several projects floated up, like a dark comedy with Anthony Mackie attached. Yet Mr. Simien was still strapped for cash. Driving to those Beverly Hills meetings, ?I was afraid to pull up to the valet, because my hubcaps were falling off,? he said. In the spring, he sold a book version of ?Dear White People? that kept him afloat financially. The film opened in the fall, to critical acclaim. 2015 As Mr. Simien toured with his film, he found a second career as a speaker, especially at colleges. ?Any school that was dealing with a race issue would book the film and then book me,? he said. He made the movie to spark discussion, so these encounters were gratifying and meaningful. He jotted down stories he heard from the students, too. When a studio approached him about making a TV version of ?Dear White People,? his notes  ?   fresh ideas  ?   were immediately useful. 2016 In May, Netflix announced the series. In June, Mr. Simien sat in a production space and marveled at his fortune. ?I?m in an office! There?s a lamp from HomeGoods! It?s ? he said. He presided over a diverse writers? room of seven people, discussing civil rights, ?blacktivism? and cultural identity. With the veteran showrunner Yvette Lee Bowser, he learned to make a TV series. 2017 ?That was probably the hardest thing I ever did,? Mr. Simien said in January after finishing the show?s first season. Production had wrapped on Election Day the series? themes were landing in a much more charged cultural landscape than where they were conceived. ?This show is 100 percent part of the resistance,? he said. Mr. Simien is pleased with it but itching to get to other projects. ?Creatively, I just need to prove to myself and to others in the industry, I?m not a   pony,? he said. Hiring for his series, he had noted that white male colleagues had been given more career chances. ?The opportunities that I have tend to be ? he said, adding, ?You just gotta keep grinding  ?   which has worked out so far. ?  2014 The   Sara Colangelo arrived at Sundance that January with an ambitious debut, ?Little Accidents. ? Set and shot in a West Virginia   town, with a sprawling story line, it was created after Ms. Colangelo won a coveted spot in the Sundance screenwriting and directing labs three years earlier, and secured a budget of $1. 2 million, all major for a   indie filmmaker. The cast  ?   including Elizabeth Banks, Josh Lucas and Chlo? Sevigny  ?   was enviable, too. But even as she set out to unveil it, Ms. Colangelo said, she knew that her film was not exactly what she wanted it to be. ?There were moments in the editing room where I was like, I?m enormously proud, but these things might not be working,? she said. Was the film too sad? How would the marketplace react? ?I was aware of what the challenges were. ? The film came with    expectations. Critics at the festival praised the acting, though, and the  . Ms. Colangelo made the Los Angeles rounds that fall, and was sent a few scripts, but no jobs materialized. She made ends meet doing corporate videos. Financially, she said, ?there were nine months or so where it was like, it?s going to be tough. ? 2015 ?Little Accidents? made it to theaters a full year after Sundance. Reviews were largely welcoming, but it barely eked out $10, 000  ?   total  ?   at the box office. Still, Ms. Colangelo earned a nomination for best first screenplay at that year?s Indie Spirit Awards, and that led to a few    jobs, polishing other people?s work. In the meantime, she watched friends and Sundance alumni  ?   mostly men  ?   advance. Doubts crept in: Could she have done more on ?Little Accidents?? Her male counterparts were often allowed reshoots. Somehow, for them, ?the money was found. ? She asked herself, ?What kind of leader do you have to be to get those things? Is it charisma? Is it truly gender?? She was buoyed when Israeli producers asked her to adapt an acclaimed,   foreign drama. (They declined to reveal it.) Ms. Colangelo worked on the script for months and finally signed a deal at the end of the year. 2016 As the Israeli film?s location and financiers bounced from Canada to New York, and casting decisions loomed, Ms. Colangelo hung on to direct. She vowed to be more flexible on production details and bolder in her focus on story. 2017 Her   was erased, replaced with excitement, and pride: She plans to begin shooting the new film this summer, shortly after the birth of her first child. ?There?s this feeling that the industry sometimes gives you, that you have this window of opportunity after Sundance and if you don?t perform perfectly in that moment or have a perfect script, then the window shuts,? she said. ?And I think that?s a dangerous way to think about it. ? Momentum, she discovered, can rebound. ?And it?s O. K. to retrieve it and find it later. ? 2014 A   filmmaker with several shorts to her credit, Kat Candler landed at Sundance with the family drama ?Hellion. ? ?I was definitely hoping to get representation,? she said, a distribution deal and attention for other projects. She knew that breakout success was rare and that her route would be tough, especially without superlative reviews. A month later, she did her water bottle week in Los Angeles. ?It felt like ?The Amazing Race,?? she said, eight meetings a day. Little came of them. ?Hellion,? starring Aaron Paul of ?Breaking Bad,? opened in theaters five months later, and Ms. Candler hit the road to promote it. Live Q. and A. s, Skype sessions  ?   ?Anytime anybody asked, it was a yes,? she said. ?It was exhausting, after a while. I wish someone had warned me. ? Her promotion helped, but not much ?Hellion? just did not have the marketing dollars. In retrospect, she said, her efforts distracted her from ?putting all the pieces for another project together. ? 2015 A year after Sundance, Ms. Candler was growing anxious. ?I felt like, oh, what am I doing?? she said. But she was halfway into a   mentorship program, sponsored by the Sundance women?s filmmaking initiative. ?The life coach was pretty transformative,? she said. She shelved her jealousy about others? deals. ?I can go write for four hours and feel a sense of accomplishment,? she said. A push to break into TV directing was fruitless, though. No one wanted to an untested TV director, even if she had already conquered the big screen. (Male directors, research shows, face a lower bar for hiring.) ?Sometimes you just wonder, how much harder do I have to work to prove myself?? Ms. Candler said. Her life coach offered a mantra: You belong in the room. So at every meeting, she said, ?I tell myself, ?You?ve earned your space. ?? In the summer, she shot a campaign for Canon. Besides money from teaching a college class, it was her first real paycheck in years. Still, she worried about car insurance payments and other bills. 2016 Back in Los Angeles, Ms. Candler had meetings about a   feature she was writing. It could go indie or mainstream, depending on the stars and how much control Ms. Candler ceded. ?Do I really want to go out for a project that doesn?t have great humanity? No,? she said. A turning point came in the spring, when she shot two episodes of ?Queen Sugar,? the series created by Ava DuVernay that employs only female directors. No pitch meetings were necessary they knew each other through the festival circuit. The paucity of female directors has been a hot topic in Hollywood, but Ms. Candler was over it. ?Just hire,? she said. ?It really isn?t that hard. ? 2017 ?Queen Sugar? was renewed, and Ms. DuVernay asked Ms. Candler to return, now as the producing director. Ms. Candler went on to shoot episodes of other series. She has work lined up through 2018. She felt confident before ?Queen Sugar,? she said. ?I just don?t think that people had confidence in us. Ava legitimized all of us. ? After 17 years in the field, she said, she was at last making a living as a filmmaker."
18205,"Lawrence K. Altman, M.d.",6/02/2017,2017,2,business,"WASHINGTON  ?   President Trump takes medication for three ailments, including a   drug to promote hair growth, Mr. Trump?s longtime physician, Dr. Harold N. Bornstein, said in a series of recent interviews. The other drugs are antibiotics to control rosacea, a common skin problem, and a statin for elevated blood cholesterol and lipids. Dr. Bornstein, who spoke by telephone in four interviews over the past month, also said that Mr. Trump takes a daily baby aspirin to reduce the risk of a heart attack. Over all, he pronounced Mr. Trump healthy and his medical care ?as exactly up to date. ? Dr. Bornstein granted the interviews after The New York Times asked him to discuss his role in Mr. Trump?s care and to clarify and expand on earlier statements he made about his patient?s health during the presidential campaign. In recent decades, The Times has interviewed presidents, presidential candidates and their doctors about their health. At 70, Mr. Trump is the oldest person to become president. White House officials declined to comment on Wednesday night on the information provided by Dr. Bornstein, and would not say whether he was still Mr. Trump?s physician. The disclosure that Mr. Trump uses a   drug to maintain growth of his scalp hair, which has not been publicly known, appears to solve a riddle of why Mr. Trump has a very low level of prostate specific antigen, or PSA, a marker for prostate cancer. Mr. Trump takes a small dose of the drug, finasteride, which lowers PSA levels. Finasteride is marketed as Propecia to treat   baldness. Dr. Bornstein said he also took finasteride and credited it for helping maintain his own   hair and Mr. Trump?s hair. ?He has all his hair,? Dr. Bornstein said. ?I have all my hair. ? Dr. Bornstein, 69, has a private practice on the Upper East Side of New York, was educated at Tufts University for college and medical school, did his fellowship in gastroenterology at Yale, and was Mr. Trump?s personal physician since 1980. He said that he had had no contact with Mr. Trump since he became president, and that no one from Mr. Trump?s White House staff had asked for copies of the medical records that he has kept for the last 36 years, or called to discuss them. Dr. Bornstein said that Mr. Trump had gone to his East Side office for annual checkups, colonoscopies, and other routine tests every year since 1980. Before that, Mr. Trump was a patient of Dr. Bornstein?s father, Dr. Jacob Bornstein. At times in the interviews, Dr. Bornstein was moody, ranging from saying that Mr. Trump?s health ?is none of your business? to later volunteering facts. He also meandered, referring to his longtime study of Italian and stories about medical schools floating cadavers to an island off the waters of New York. He said he liked the attention he got from friends now that he was publicly known as Mr. Trump?s doctor but disliked ?the fun made of me? by the news media and strangers who have thrown objects at his office window and who have yelled at him on Park Avenue. Dr. Bornstein?s first brush with the public was in December 2015, when he released a hyperbolic   letter about Mr. Trump?s health. ?If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency,? Dr. Bornstein wrote. He offered scant medical evidence for his prediction beyond saying Mr. Trump had no significant illness and nothing that required treatment outside of his office. Eight months later, Dr. Bornstein stirred controversy by saying he wrote the letter in five minutes while a limousine sent by Mr. Trump waited outside. A second letter in September 2016 was more sober, although it omitted a number of details that would be part of a customary summary of a patient?s health. The letter did say that Mr. Trump is    weighs 236 pounds, has a normal blood pressure of   and takes a drug called rosuvastatin (marketed as Crestor) to lower cholesterol and other lipids. Dr. Bornstein did not say how high the lipids were before the statin therapy, but he reported that the levels were in the normal range in recent tests: cholesterol, 169 HDL cholesterol, 63 LDL cholesterol, 94 triglycerides, 61. In both letters, Dr. Bornstein wrote that Mr. Trump?s PSA level was 0. 15. The low number led urologists not connected with Mr. Trump to say that he must have been treated for an enlarged prostate or prostate cancer. But Dr. Bornstein said in the interviews that Mr. Trump had had neither ailment and that his PSA level is low because of Propecia. In the interviews, Dr. Bornstein said he refilled Mr. Trump?s prescriptions for a   tetracycline, a common antibiotic, to control rosacea. The skin ailment can cause easy blushing or flushing with visible blood vessels. It also can spread over the face, and sometimes the chest and back. In different forms it can resemble acne and cause bumps. Dr. Bornstein also addressed questions about Mr. Trump?s recent description of himself as a ?germophobe. ?? Dr. Bornstein said he had never discussed that phenomenon with Mr. Trump, but ?we are very careful to keep the examining rooms spotlessly clean, which we do anyway. ?? He added, ?He always stands there and changes the paper on the table himself? after an examination. ?Other than that, nothing. ? Dr. Bornstein said that he was sure that Mr. Trump was up to date on an H. I. V. test, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that all adults get at least once. He said if he became the White House doctor he doubted that he would include in Mr. Trump?s annual checkup any psychometric tests as a base line for potential dementia. Mr. Trump?s father, Fred, suffered from Alzheimer?s disease in his eighties and a number of experts have urged that older political leaders undergo such tests. Dr. Bornstein also said he had cared for Mr. Trump?s first and third wives, and occasionally for the second. ?I am probably the only person in the world who has every phone number for him and all the wives,? Dr. Bornstein said. About a month ago, Dr. Bornstein said he told Mr. Trump?s secretary, Rhona Graff, ?You know, I should be the White House physician. ? Past presidents like Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush brought their own doctors to the White House, but others have used a White House physician. Dr. Bornstein was invited to Mr. Trump?s inaugural, although he said it was not as pleasant an experience as he expected. He had to walk a long way to a spot where he thought there would be a chair  ?   he said he has a painful back ailment and nerve damage to a leg  ?   but when he got there, there was no chair. He stood behind a tree and ?never heard anyone speak because I was so uncomfortable from my back and being cold. ? He felt, he said, ?absolutely miserable. ? It seemed to take forever to leave because of the heavy security, he said. The situation was the same at an inaugural ball where there were no tables and chairs. So, he said, unable to chat comfortably with others, he and his wife, Melissa, returned to their hotel early."
17941,Neil Irwin,31/03/2017,2017,3,politics,"We?re resurfacing this article in light of President Trump?s recent comments on Nafta. After calling it the ?worst trade deal,? he seems to be softening his stance.  It was a deal that created a deeply intertwined economy stretching from the Arctic to Central America and a generation of mostly warm relations between the United States and its two neighbors. It has also contributed to the loss of manufacturing jobs in the United States and added to   discontent in the communities that lost them. That, in turn, helped propel a sharp critic of the deal to the White House. So with Donald J. Trump in charge, what happens now to the North American Free Trade Agreement? It?s one thing to assail it as the ?worst trade deal ever? as the president did during the campaign. It?s quite another to come up with an arrangement that is more advantageous to American workers and businesses. ?Nafta is logically the first thing for us to deal with,? said Wilbur Ross, the president?s nominee to be commerce secretary, in his confirmation hearing. It will be, he said, a ?very, very early topic in the administration. ? So what might that actually mean? What can the president actually do, what benefits might be attained for the United States and what could go wrong? Trade experts say there really is room to make major change in the    agreement. A renegotiation could well lead to a better deal for all three countries. But it will require the United States to make concessions that the Trump administration may be wary of offering. If not approached carefully, revamping an agreement that has created the economic underpinning of major industries would risk American jobs as well as higher prices for consumers. And the closer the Trump administration gets to blowing up the deal, the larger those risks loom. Before diving into what could go wrong  ?   and right  ?   as President Trump looks to rework Nafta, it?s worth starting with the basics. What is Nafta? On Oct. 7, 1992, President George H. W. Bush stood in San Antonio flanked by the president of Mexico and the prime minister of Canada. ?This meeting marks a turning point in the history of our three countries,? he said. ?We are creating the largest, richest and most productive market in the entire world. ? Mr. Bush?s successor, Bill Clinton, was the one to push the North American Free Trade Agreement through a divided Congress. By 1994, the three countries were entwined in a trade deal that, in its 22 chapters covering 309 pages, lashed their economies together. It eliminated most tariffs on goods traded between the nations, and set in place processes to get rid of regulatory and other barriers. The idea was that over time a company in Ohio could do business with a firm in Ontario as easily as it did with one in Indiana. What have been its results? As the election showed, whether Nafta was a good thing for voters in the United States or a bad one continues to be argued. But there are some things most people who study these things can agree upon. The North American economy really does work as an integrated whole. United States exports to Mexico, for example, are now 3. 5 times their 1993 level when adjusted for inflation. They have risen more than twice as fast as the overall economy. Trade between the United States and Canada has been pretty well balanced over time, but the United States has had about a $60 billion per year trade deficit with Mexico, importing more than it exports. In the auto industry, for example, supply chains crisscross North American borders, with work of different complexity done in different countries. Your Ford made in Michigan might contain a dashboard made in Juarez and a transmission made in Windsor, Ontario. This complex supply chain has helped make the U. S. auto industry competitive with manufacturers in Asia and Europe, which also contain both   and   countries with different specialties. The impact on jobs and incomes in the United States is less clear. Economists broadly supportive of free trade deals argue that Nafta essentially encouraged a shift of jobs in the United States toward   more productive work, raising wages and having negligible impact on the total number of jobs. Those more skeptical of the deal view it as having created   competition across the border in Mexico that accelerated the loss of manufacturing jobs. (See a more detailed explanation of the competing views here and here.) One way to reconcile those two views: Nafta may have increased overall G. D. P. and average incomes in the United States  ?   but at the same time contributed to the decline in   U. S. manufacturing jobs that tended to be concentrated in certain cities and among certain groups of people, mostly   men. Can President Trump kill the deal? In theory, yes. But it would be a mess, particularly if he tried to do it right off the bat. Article 2205 of  Nafta says that a country can withdraw from the agreement six months after giving notice. But if President Trump did that, it would unleash disarray in major industries ruin the ability to have   negotiations with Canada and Mexico and most likely cause a legal showdown with Congress (which passed Nafta all those years ago and wouldn?t want it abrogated without a say). That doesn?t sound like what the Trump administration has cooked up. It?s more likely to reopen the deal. ?I?m optimistic that we can renegotiate the deal that?s both advantageous to us and advantageous to Mexico, that?s a   for both countries,? said Steve Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary nominee, in his confirmation hearing. Will Canada and Mexico come to the table for a renegotiation? Sure looks that way. The White House has announced plans to meet separately with the leaders of both countries, and all signals are that they?re up for new talks. In the case of Mexico, President Enrique Pe?a Nieto has said he wants talks to cover a wider gamut than trade alone  ?   implicitly threatening to become less cooperative on fighting drug trafficking and other frontiers if the Trump administration is excessively punitive in trade talks. And, of course, Mr. Trump?s announcement today that he will build a wall on the border  ?   and that Mexico will eventually pay for it  ?   could cause Mexico to rethink its outlook on trade negotiations altogether. So what is the United States going to ask for? We don?t know for sure, but some hints have emerged. One strong possibility would be to focus on ?rules of origin? governing what counts as an automobile or other finished good produced within the free trade area. For example, a steering wheel might be assembled in Mexico but include parts made in China the rules of origin state how many of those parts can come from China while still counting as a Mexican steering wheel and thus enjoy the benefits of the free trade zone. If the required share of North American parts were increased  ?   from its current 62. 5 percent for many auto parts to 75 percent, for example  ?   it would give an advantage to manufacturers in the United States and reduce competition with the   countries of Asia. Another example of a possible United States priority: asking Canada and Mexico to be more liberal in allowing goods to be shipped into their countries with no taxes and little paperwork. (To be precise, asking them to raise the value of what would count as a ?de minimus? shipment exempt from the usual customs process). That would be good news for American companies looking to sell into those countries. The United States has long complained that the tribunals that settle trade disputes among the three countries are stacked against U. S. interests, and it could seek changes. Those sure seem like perfectly normal things for trade deals to focus on. They are. But there was one more goal for the United States that Trump argued for during the campaign, and it would be a bigger source of friction if his negotiators chose to pursue it. Mr. Trump characterized the   tax that both Mexico and Canada have as unfair to U. S. companies. The tax is 16 percent in Mexico when a Mexican firm exports goods to the United States, it receives a rebate for the tax it paid, and when a U. S. firm exports to Mexico, a comparable adjustment is added. Mr. Ross, the Commerce secretary nominee, and Peter Navarro, a Trump White House trade adviser, argued in a white paper during the campaign that this amounts to an unfair export subsidy that penalizes the United States. Canada and Mexico aren?t likely to see it that way, and will resist if the United States seeks a change to the rules so that a VAT adjustment is no longer added to U. S. exports into their countries. In their view  ?   and that of mainstream economists  ?   their approach to taxing is the only way to avoid unfairly penalizing their domestic companies. The VAT is similar to a sales tax, and to the Mexican government, the Trump position will sound like the equivalent of Massachusetts demanding that it be able to sell its goods in Connecticut without a sales tax slapped on them. So if that issue ends up at the center of the negotiation, things could get rocky. But a deal should get done, right? Maybe. But keep in mind: This won?t be a   street. Both Canada and Mexico expect concessions from the United States in return for concessions they make. And some of the things that the Mexican government most covets will rankle many Trump supporters. For example, Mexico wants better access to a program, widely enjoyed at the Canadian border, in which shippers that pass a security review are allowed to cross the border with a less intensive customs process (this is the international trade equivalent of the ?T. S. A. PreCheck? security line at the airport). Mexico also seeks more favorable treatment for Mexican citizens with advanced skills seeking visas to work temporarily in the United States. Needless to say, making it easier for Mexican trucks and Mexican workers to get into the United States isn?t exactly what Trump campaigned on. But that?s the kind of concession that may be needed to get a trade deal. Is there a chance Nafta completely blows up? There is  ?   though not necessarily in catastrophic fashion. Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, lays out a possibility in which the Trump administration does eventually withdraw from Nafta, but in a context in which it has worked out separate deals with Mexico and Canada that maintain most of the trade arrangements codified in Nafta. President Trump and his advisers have often spoken of a preference for bilateral deals instead of big multicountry trade deals. It is potentially a pathway for Trump to be able to proclaim that he ended a trade deal he assailed on the campaign trail, without wrecking the economy. Even that wouldn?t necessarily be painless, however. ?It would be like ? Mr. Hufbauer said. ?There will be firms and communities in the U. S. that will be adversely affected, that will close down if you disrupt these supply chains. That won?t make for good newspaper coverage, and presumably the Trump team will want to avoid that. ? Just how urgent is renegotiating Nafta? Campaign promises aside, even some people who have been opposed to Nafta and other trade deals don?t view this as a   priority. U. S. trade with Canada is reasonably well balanced, and the trade deficit with Mexico is smaller than that with some giant Asian economies. Robert E. Scott, the director of trade and manufacturing policy at the liberal Economic Policy Institute, sees more to be gained by rethinking the trade relationship between the United States and China, Japan, South Korea and even Germany. ?Those are accountable for 80 percent of   job losses over the last 20 years,? he said. ?To me, Nafta is not a top priority. ? ?There are much bigger fish to fry,? he added."
18326,Glenn Thrush and Maggie Haberman,7/02/2017,2017,2,politics,"WASHINGTON  ?   President Trump loves to set the day?s narrative at dawn, but the deeper story of his White House is best told at night. Aides confer in the dark because they cannot figure out how to operate the light switches in the cabinet room. Visitors conclude their meetings and then wander around, testing doorknobs until finding one that leads to an exit. In a darkened, mostly empty West Wing, Mr. Trump?s provocative chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, finishes another   day planning new lines of attack. Usually around 6:30 p. m. or sometimes later, Mr. Trump retires upstairs to the residence to recharge, vent and intermittently use Twitter. With his wife, Melania, and young son, Barron, staying in New York, he is almost always by himself, sometimes in the protective presence of his imposing longtime aide and former security chief, Keith Schiller. When Mr. Trump is not watching television in his bathrobe or on his phone reaching out to old campaign hands and advisers, he will sometimes set off to explore the unfamiliar surroundings of his new home. During his first two dizzying weeks in office, Mr. Trump, an outsider president working with a surprisingly small crew of no more than a   empowered aides with virtually no familiarity with the workings of the White House or federal government, sent shock waves at home and overseas with a succession of executive orders designed to fulfill campaign promises and taunt foreign leaders. ?We are moving big and we are moving fast,? Mr. Bannon said, when asked about the upheaval of the first two weeks. ?We didn?t come here to do small things. ? But one thing has become apparent to both his allies and his opponents: When it comes to governing, speed does not always guarantee success. The bungled rollout of his executive order barring immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries, a flurry of other miscues and embarrassments, and an approval rating lower than that of any comparable   president in the history of polling have Mr. Trump and his top staff rethinking an improvisational approach to governing that mirrors his chaotic presidential campaign, administration officials and Trump insiders said. This account of the early days of the Trump White House is based on interviews with dozens of government officials, congressional aides, former staff members and other observers of the new administration, many of whom requested anonymity. At the center of the story, according to these sources, is a president determined to go big but increasingly frustrated by the efforts of his small team to contain the backlash. ?What are we going to do about this?? Mr. Trump pointedly asked an aide last week, a period of turmoil briefly interrupted by the successful rollout of his Supreme Court selection, Judge Neil M. Gorsuch. Chris Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media and an old friend of the president?s, said: ?I think, in his mind, the success of this is going to be the poll numbers. If they continue to be weak or go lower, then somebody?s going to have to bear some responsibility for that. ? ?I personally think that they?re missing the big picture here,? Mr. Ruddy said of Mr. Trump?s staff. ?Now he?s so caught up, the administration is so caught up in turmoil, perceived chaos, that the Democrats smell blood, the protesters, the media smell blood. ? One former staff member likened the aggressive approach of the first two weeks to   but said the president?s team had stormed the beaches without any plan for a longer war. Clashes among staff are common in the opening days of every administration, but they have seldom been so public and so pronounced this early. ?This is a president who came to Washington vowing to shake up the establishment, and this is what it looks like. It?s going to be a little sloppy, there are going to be conflicts,? said Ari Fleischer, President George W. Bush?s first press secretary. All this is happening as Mr. Trump, a man of flexible ideology but fixed habits, adjusts to a new job, life and city. Cloistered in the White House, he now has little access to his fans and supporters  ?   an important source of feedback and validation  ?   and feels increasingly pinched by the pressures of the job and the constant presence of protests, one of the reasons he was forced to scrap a planned trip to Milwaukee last week. For a sense of what is happening outside, he watches cable, both at night and during the day  ?   too much in the eyes of some aides  ?   often offering a bitter    of critics like CNN?s Don Lemon. Until the past few days, Mr. Trump was telling his friends and advisers that he believed the opening stages of his presidency were going well. ?Did you hear that, this guy thinks it?s been terrible!? Mr. Trump said mockingly to other aides when one dissenting view was voiced last week during a West Wing meeting. But his opinion has begun to change with a relentless parade of bad headlines. Mr. Trump got away from the White House this weekend for the first time since his inauguration, spending it in Palm Beach, Fla. at his private club,    posting Twitter messages angrily  ?   and in personal terms  ?   about the federal judge who put a nationwide halt on the travel ban. Mr. Bannon and Reince Priebus, the two clashing power centers, traveled with him. By then, the president, for whom chains of command and policy minutiae rarely meant much, was demanding that Mr. Priebus begin to put in effect a much more conventional White House protocol that had been taken for granted in previous administrations: From now on, Mr. Trump would be looped in on the drafting of executive orders much earlier in the process. Another change will be a new set of checks on the previously unfettered power enjoyed by Mr. Bannon and the White House policy director, Stephen Miller, who oversees the implementation of the orders and who received the brunt of the internal and public criticism for the rollout of the travel ban. Mr. Priebus has told Mr. Trump and Mr. Bannon that the administration needs to rethink its policy and communications operation in the wake of embarrassing revelations that key details of the orders were withheld from agencies, White House staff and Republican congressional leaders like Speaker Paul D. Ryan. Mr. Priebus has also created a   checklist for the release of any new initiatives that includes signoff from the communications department and the White House staff secretary, Robert Porter, according to several aides familiar with the process. Mr. Priebus bristles at the perception that he occupies a diminished perch in the West Wing pecking order compared with previous chiefs. But for the moment, Mr. Bannon remains the president?s dominant adviser, despite Mr. Trump?s anger that he was not fully briefed on details of the executive order he signed giving his chief strategist a seat on the National Security Council, a greater source of frustration to the president than the fallout from the travel ban. It is partly because he is seen as having a clear vision on policy. But it is also because others who had been expected to fill major roles have been less confident in asserting their power. Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump?s    occupies a central role in the administration and has been present at most major decisions and photo ops, but he is a father of young children who has taken to life in Washington, and, along with his wife, Ivanka Trump, has already been spotted at events around town. Mr. Bannon has rushed into the vacuum, telling allies that he and Mr. Miller have a brief window in which to push through their vision of Mr. Trump?s economic nationalism. Mr. Bannon, whose website, Breitbart, was a magnet for white nationalists and xenophobic speech, has also tried to reassure official Washington. He has been careful to build bridges with the Republican establishment, especially Mr. Ryan  ?   whom he once described as ?the enemy? and vowed to force out. He now talks regularly with Mr. Ryan to coordinate strategy or plot their planned overhaul of the tax code. Before he was ousted in November as transition chief, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, the Trump adviser with the most government experience, helped prepare a detailed staffing and implementation plan in line with the kickoff strategies of previous Republican presidents. It was discarded  ?   a senior Trump aide made a show of tossing it into a garbage can  ?   for a strategy that prioritized the daily release of dramatic executive orders to put opponents on the defensive. Mr. Christie, who agrees in principle with the broad strokes of Mr. Trump?s immigration policy, says the president has been let down by his staff. ?The president deserves better than the rollout he got on the immigration executive order,? Mr. Christie said. ?The fact is that he?s put forward a policy that, in my opinion, is significantly more effective than what he had proposed during the campaign, yet because of the botched implementation, they allowed his opponents to attack him by calling it a Muslim ban. ? In the past few days, Mr. Trump?s team has stressed its cohesion and the challenges of   an administration that few outside its group ever thought would exist. ?This team spent months in the foxhole together during the campaign,? said Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary. ?We moved into the White House as a unified team committed to enacting the president?s agenda. ? As part of Mr. Trump?s Oval Office renovation, he ordered that four hardback chairs be placed in a semicircle around his Resolute Desk now heaped, in Trump Tower fashion, with memos and newspapers. They are an emblem of Mr. Trump?s    management style, but also a reminder that in the White House, the seats always outlast the people seated in them. But finding enough skilled players to fill key slots has not been easy: Mr. Spicer is serving double duty as communications director, a key planning position, in addition to engaging in    combat with the news media. Mr. Trump, several aides said, is used to quarterbacking his own media strategy, and did not see the value of hiring an outsider. An early plan was to give the communications job to Kellyanne Conway, his former campaign manager and top TV surrogate, but the demands of the job would have conflicted with Ms. Conway?s other duties as a   adviser to Mr. Trump with Oval Office   privileges, according to one aide. Mr. Trump remains intensely focused on his brand, but the demands of the job mean he spends less time monitoring the news media  ?   although he recently upgraded the   TV in his private dining room so he can watch the news while eating lunch. He often has to wait until the end of the workday before grinding through news clips with Mr. Spicer, marking the ones he does not like with a big arrow in black Sharpie  ?   though he almost always makes time to monitor Mr. Spicer?s performance at the daily briefings, summoning him to offer praise or criticism, a West Wing aide said. Visitors to the Oval Office say Mr. Trump is obsessed with the d?cor  ?   it is both a totem of a victory that validates him as a serious person and an   backdrop  ?   so he has told his staff to schedule as many televised events in the room as possible. To pass the time between meetings, Mr. Trump gives quick tours to visitors, highlighting little tweaks he has made after initially expecting he would have to pay for them himself. Flanking his desk are portraits of Presidents Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson. He will linger on the opulence of the newly hung golden drapes, which he told a recent visitor were once used by Franklin D. Roosevelt but in fact were patterned for Bill Clinton. For a man who sometimes has trouble concentrating on policy memos, Mr. Trump was delighted to page through a book that offered him 17 window covering options. Ultimately, this is very much the White House that Mr. Trump wanted to build. But while the world reckons with the effect he is having on the presidency, he is adjusting to the effect of the presidency on him. He is now a public employee. And the only boss Mr. Trump ever had in his life was his father, a   developer the president still treats with deep reverence. With most of his belongings in New York, the only family picture on the shelf behind Mr. Trump?s desk is a small    photograph of that boss, Frederick Christ Trump."
17473,Daniel Victor,9/01/2017,2017,1,entertainment,"Let?s just be very clear about this: There is no movie called ?Hidden Fences. ? But you would be forgiven for thinking otherwise after watching the Golden Globes, after the nonexistent movie was mentioned twice. The first time was definitely a mistake. The second time is not so clear. First, NBC?s Jenna Bush Hager, taking her first turn at Golden Globes reporting, presumably meant to ask Pharrell Williams about his best original score nomination for ?Hidden Figures,? a movie about three black women who would play crucial roles in the American space program. Surely she didn?t mean to ask him about ?Fences,? a similarly renowned film starring Viola Davis and Denzel Washington. Mr. Williams had no involvement in that. But: Mr. Williams?s   reaction, in which he appeared to be doing his best to hold back whatever he badly wished to say, was impressive in its restraint. Unsurprisingly, the immediate reaction on Twitter was less restrained. ?So Jenna Bush is just merging all of the black movies tonight at the #GoldenGlobes, huh?? one user asked. ?Pharrell?s face just held hundreds of years of whitewashing resolve,? another said. Others had fun in similarly inventing new movie titles. That seemed to be the end of things, but for some reason, Michael Keaton also referred to ?Hidden Fences? when listing the nominees for best supporting actress in a motion picture. Since the camera was focused on the actresses, it?s unclear if Mr. Keaton said it with a wink and a nod."
18037,Eli Rosenberg and Liam Stack,29/01/2017,2017,1,business,"Social media shook with emotion. Headlines shouted the news. Legal scholars debated the order?s scope. But the most immediate effect of President Trump?s executive order barring refugees from entering the United States and halting entry from seven predominantly Muslim countries could be quantified on a human scale: refugees and other immigrants from those seven countries, some on their way to the United States on Friday when Mr. Trump signed the order, who were no longer able to enter the United States. Here are some of their stories. Hearing of Mr. Trump?s plan to slam the door on Muslim immigrants this week, Mr. Shareef hurried his wife and three children onto a plane in the Iraqi city of Erbil in the early hours of Saturday. They had been cleared to resettle in Nashville  ?   a new life that Mr. Shareef considered a great opportunity. After the American invasion of Iraq in 2003, Mr. Shareef worked as a translator with American officials, and he received death threats. But after the Shareefs arrived in Cairo on Saturday, a   official spoke to Mr. Shareef. ?He said they had just received an email from the U. S. Embassy in Baghdad,? Mr. Shareef said. ?It said we could not get on the flight. ? Speaking by phone from an airport lounge, Mr. Shareef said he had sold the family home and car. His wife had given up her job. His two daughters, 10 and 17, had quit school. He had spent $5, 000 on flights. ?I thought in America there are institutions, democracy,? he said. ?This looks like a decision from a dictator. I don?t understand. ? ?Donald Trump ruined my life,? he said. Ms. Omer, 39, is a green card holder, has lived in the United States since 1993, and graduated from Harvard University. On Friday night Ms. Omer was detained at Kennedy International Airport as she returned from Sudan, where she is a citizen, after a research trip for her anthropology Ph. D. at Stanford University. Ms. Omer said customs officials were apologetic and appeared confused about what they were supposed to do with the detained travelers. ?I have to do this,? one told her. For five hours they asked about her travels, her academic research and her views on Sudanese politics, which they admitted to knowing little about. At one point, she said, they aggressively patted her down and handcuffed her. They removed the restraints when she began to cry, but the detainees brought in for questioning after her arrived in handcuffs, she said. ?For the brief moment I was handcuffed, I couldn?t control myself and I just started crying,? Ms. Omer said. ?It was humiliating. I thought I was going to be returned to Sudan. ? After Ms. Omer was released she said she felt like one of the lucky ones. ?There are a lot of people being treated much worse or are being sent back,? she said. ?If they get sent back to Iraq or Syria it is a    situation. ? Hazhir Rahmandad, a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology?s Sloan School of Management, said his parents who hold green cards and split their time between the United States and Iran, were due back in Massachusetts on Tuesday to celebrate the birthday of Mr. Rahmandad?s twin children. Now they will not travel. Professor Rahmandad set up a Google form for people from countries affected by the immigration order to report and share their experiences attempting to travel to the U. S. ?I was so concerned,? he said. By Saturday evening, his spreadsheet had over 200 entries, most of them concerning people from Iran. Mr. Abdi, 30, a Ph. D. student in anthropology at Yale with permanent residency in the United States, said he left the United States on Jan. 22 for Afghanistan, where he planned to do field research for much of the next year. He had participated in the women?s march in Washington the day before. Now, he said he was in legal limbo as he awaited a visa from the consulate of Afghanistan, unable to return to the United States even with a green card and fearful of returning to Iran because of his activism about human rights issues there. Speaking by phone from Dubai, Mr. Abdi said his current visa limits his stay in the United Arab Emirates to about a month. The possibility that green card holders and refugees could be barred from the United States did not occur to him when he left, he said. ?We didn?t believe it really, that it was going to be implemented,? he said. ?Maybe we were taking the Trump administration less seriously than it is. ? Nada, a Yazidi woman from Iraq, was on her way to be reunited with her husband, Khalas, who lives in Washington. The two of them, their last names not released, were granted special immigrant visas to the United States as part of a program created to help thousands of Iraqis with ties to the United States, according to The New Yorker. Khalas, a former interpreter for the United States Army, was granted his visa in April. Nada?s visa was approved about a week ago, and her passport on Thursday. She was turned away, however, when she arrived at the gate for her flight in Dubai, wrote Kirk W. Johnson, the founder and executive director of the List Project to Resettle Iraqi Allies. ?The flight crew sent her back,? Khalas texted Mr. Johnson, ?saying they got orders that no Iraqis with American visas should be boarded. ? Ms. Assali, 25, a   medical student from Allentown, Pa. said six of her Syrian relatives had arrived in Philadelphia on a flight from Doha, Qatar, on Saturday morning, only to be detained and put on a flight back less than three hours later. The group had obtained   immigrant visas. Ms. Assali said in a telephone interview that her six relatives  ?   two uncles, two aunts and two teenage cousins, whom she did not name out of fear of endangering them or their case  ?   are Christians who live in Damascus. Her father was on his way to pick up the relatives from the airport when he got a call from a customs official, she said, who said his family would not be leaving the airport. ?They told him they?re not coming out, and to just go back. ? Ms. Assali said. ?And that it?s confidential and he can?t tell them why. They said it was an issue with their paperwork. ? Mr. Darweesh, a husband and father of three who worked for the United States military in Iraq for about a decade, was detained after arriving at Kennedy Airport on Friday night. He was granted a special immigrant visa on Jan. 20. When he filed for it, he said he had been directly targeted because of his work for the United States as an interpreter, engineer and contractor. Mr. Darweesh was released on Saturday after lawyers filed a writ of habeas corpus in federal court seeking freedom for him, as well as for another Iraqi detained at the airport. Speaking to reporters and some protesters who gathered outside Kennedy Airport, Mr. Darweesh called the United States the greatest nation in the world. He said he was thankful for the people who had worked on his behalf. ?This is the humanity, this is the soul of America,? he said. ?This is what pushed me to move, leave my country and come here. ? Ms. Tayari, a resident of the United Kingdom who holds an Iranian passport, was unable to get back to Glasgow, where she works as a veterinarian, from Costa Rica, where she was vacationing, because her flight traveled through New York, according to The Guardian. Ms. Tayari grew up in Italy and told the newspaper that she had never experienced anything like it. She said it might cost her a month?s salary to book a new flight home. ?I am destroyed,? she said. ?I did not know that I could cry for so long. It feels like the beginning of the end. How this is possible? I am really afraid about what is going on. ? The family members have been living in a refugee camp in Turkey, and were scheduled to fly to the United States on Monday, according to US Together, a refugee resettlement agency quoted in The Plain Dealer of Cleveland. The agency had found an apartment for them to rent with another family of Syrian refugees in Cleveland. Those plans have been canceled after Mr. Trump?s order. ?It was going to be really perfect,? Danielle Drake, a community relations manager for US Together, told the newspaper. ?I can?t even imagine how the family feels right now. ? Mr. Saravi, a young scientist in Iran, had been scheduled to travel to Boston, where he had been awarded a fellowship at Harvard to study cardiovascular medicine, according to Thomas Michel, the professor who was to supervise his research. Then the visas for Mr. Saravi and his wife were suspended, Professor Michel said. ?This outstanding young scientist has enormous potential to make contributions that will improve our understanding of heart disease, and he has already been thoroughly vetted,? Professor Michel wrote to The New York Times. ?This country and this city have a long history of providing research training to the best young scientists in the world, many of whom have stayed in the U. S. A. and made tremendous contributions in biomedicine and other disciplines. ? Mr. Alshawi, who worked for a United States contractor in Iraq, was detained after he landed at Kennedy Airport on Friday. He had flown from Stockholm to New York, en route to Texas to see his wife and son. ?He gave his package and his passport to an airport officer, and they didn?t talk to him, they just put him in a room,? his wife, who asked to be referred to only by her first initial, D, told The New York Times. ?He told me that they forced him to get back to Iraq. He asked for his lawyer and to apply for an asylum case. And they told him: ?You can?t do that. You need to go back to your country. ??"
17872,Hari Kumar and Geeta Anand,23/01/2017,2017,1,crime,"NEW DELHI  ?   At least 36 passengers were killed in a train derailment in southern India on Saturday night, the latest disaster on India?s old and overburdened railway system. Government and medical authorities said that at least 40 additional passengers were injured, several critically, and admitted to hospitals. Rescue workers struggled into the early morning to pull the injured passengers and dead bodies from the engine and nine coaches, the authorities said. The accident took place in the Vizianagaram district of Andhra Pradesh state in southern India, when the engine and coaches of the Hirakhand Express from Jagdalpur to Bhubaneshwar derailed at 11:15 p. m. according to a statement issued by Indian Railways, the   firm that runs India?s trains. The authorities said the cause was not clear, and Indian Railways announced an investigation. India?s railways, which transport 23 million people a day over more than 70, 000 miles of track, have been neglected for years. In 2014, there were more than 27, 000   deaths in India. In 2012, a committee appointed to review the safety of the rail network cited ?a grim picture of inadequate performance largely due to poor infrastructure and resources. ? It recommended many urgent measures, including upgrading tracks, repairing bridges, eliminating level crossings and replacing old coaches with safer ones that would better protect passengers in case of an accident. These remedies came with a hefty price tag: The committee said it would cost some $14 billion over five years to put the railways on safer footing. Still, it advised that the work should proceed ?in a   manner with required resources mobilized. ? This was never done. Enku Swamy, the district fire officer for Vizianagaram, said in a telephone interview that rescue agencies took about 40 minutes to reach the accident site, in a remote area close to the border of Odisha state. ?Some people died because of a stampede inside the derailed coaches,? Mr. Swamy said. Madan Mohal Nial, 21, a passenger, said in an interview from his hospital bed that he was making the journey to take an exam for a government job when the derailment happened. ?We heard a loud noise suddenly, and the train coaches turned upside down,? he said. ?Many passengers fell down on me. My left hand got trapped in the window rods and got injured. ? Despite the injury to his arm, he searched the coach twice for his luggage because it contained his educational certificates, he said. He said he was not able to find his luggage and finally had to leave to be hospitalized.   injured passengers were admitted to the nearby Government Area Hospital in Parvatipuram. ?Most of the injured suffered abdominal and chest crush injuries, and multiple bone fractures on upper and lower limbs,? Dr. G. Nagabhusana Rao, medical superintendent of the hospital, said in a telephone interview. Indian Railways announced compensation of 200, 000 rupees, about $2, 937, to the families of the dead, and 50, 000 rupees, or about $734, to injured passengers. Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his grief on Twitter, calling the accident a tragedy. Passenger safety, or the lack of it, has come under scrutiny in India in recent months. In November, more than 140 passengers died in the derailment of passenger coaches near the city of Kanpur. In the weeks after that accident, two more people died in another derailment of passenger coaches in the same stretch of track."
18452,Randall Smith,11/02/2017,2017,2,business,"Maurice R. Greenberg, the former chief executive of American International Group, reached an unexpected settlement ending a tumultuous,   battle over civil accounting fraud charges first brought in 2005 by New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer. Mr. Greenberg, 91, and his   Howard Smith, A. I. G. ?s former chief financial officer, reached the agreement with the current New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, who announced it on Friday. In the settlement, the two men acknowledged that they had participated in and approved two transactions that inaccurately portrayed A. I. G. ?s financial results over four years. They agreed to give up more than $9. 9 million that they received as performance bonuses from 2001 through 2004, with Mr. Greenberg paying most of that amount. But it is a fraction of the more than $50 million the state had sought. The former executives also released statements acknowledging their roles in the transactions, but not admitting to fraud. After negotiations spanning about two months, the settlement was a quiet conclusion to a case that began during an era when Mr. Spitzer extracted large fines after accusing Wall Street research analysts of publishing biased research, mutual fund managers of shady trading and insurance brokers of rigging bids and receiving kickbacks. The Enron and WorldCom accounting frauds had shaken corporate boards. But Mr. Greenberg was determined to fight his case, and both sides dug in for a long battle. Neither Mr. Greenberg nor Mr. Spitzer have the same jobs they had in 2005, having receded from those prominent roles. The trial began in September before New York State Supreme Court Justice Charles E. Ramos after 11 years of delays and legal maneuvering, much of it as Mr. Greenberg appealed rulings by the judge. After his testimony and   in the trial, Mr. Greenberg and the lawyers arguing for the state began mediation in December. The trial had been set to resume last month, but was postponed pending the talks. The former executives were accused of overseeing two sham reinsurance deals aimed at duping A. I. G. investors. One deal turned auto warranty insurance losses into investment losses the other inflated A. I. G. reserves by $500 million. The charges led to Mr. Greenberg?s ouster in 2005 as chief of A. I. G. which he had built into a global insurance leader. In a statement on Friday, Mr. Schneiderman said, ?Today?s agreement settles the indisputable fact that Mr. Greenberg has denied for 12 years: that Mr. Greenberg orchestrated two transactions that fundamentally misrepresented A. I. G. ?s finances. ? In his statement, Mr. Greenberg said he ?initiated, participated in and approved these two transactions? as a result, A. I. G. ?s public filings ?inaccurately portrayed the accounting, and thus the financial condition and performance for A. I. G. ?s loss reserves and underwriting income. ? In an interview, David Boies, Mr. Greenberg?s lawyer, called the agreement a ?nuisance settlement,? noting that Mr. Greenberg had avoided two penalties sought by the state that would have barred him from working in the securities industry or as an officer of a public company. The settlement?s outline was framed by the mediator, Kenneth R. Feinberg. The transactions were featured when A. I. G. settled accounting fraud charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2006. One, a reinsurance deal between A. I. G. and General Reinsurance Corporation, a company owned by Berkshire Hathaway, prompted federal criminal charges in Connecticut against several former executives of the companies two former Gen Re executives pleaded guilty. A 2008 jury verdict against five others was overturned on appeal. What began as a   battle was nasty from the start. Before he brought the charges in May 2005, Mr. Spitzer had forced the ouster of Mr. Greenberg?s son Jeffrey as chief executive of the insurance brokerage Marsh  McLennan after charging it with   and receiving kickbacks. And Mr. Greenberg complained that Mr. Spitzer was treating minor infractions, like ?foot faults? in tennis, as capital crimes. Mr. Spitzer shot back, ?too many foot faults, and you can lose the match. ? Early in the trial, Mr. Greenberg admitted to a sometimes active role in formulating the transactions at issue but insisted he had intended for them to comply with accounting rules. He said he had left most details to subordinates. On the stand, he lunged and parried with state trial lawyer David E. Nachman, avoiding simple answers so often that the judge chided him. ?If we don?t want this trial to last a year, you?re going to have to give direct answers,? Judge Ramos said. In his opening statement, Mr. Boies said, ?this case is devoid of any admissible evidence that ties Mr. Greenberg to anything that was improper about these two transactions. ? Saule Omarova, who specializes in the regulation of financial institutions as a professor at Cornell Law School, said the case was about the legacies of Mr. Greenberg as A. I. G. ?s longtime leader and Mr. Spitzer as a onetime prominent Wall Street regulator. Stepping back, she said, the case is a prominent example of regulators? efforts to untangle the blame for ?  activities at large financial conglomerates? that later loomed large in the financial crisis of 2008. Three years after the charges led to Mr. Greenberg?s ouster, A. I. G. nearly collapsed and needed an $185 billion federal rescue. Mr. Spitzer resigned as New York governor in 2008 in a prostitution scandal. The state and the two defendants had reached an agreement to settle the case just before A. I. G. ?s  . However, a steep drop in A. I. G. ?s stock price at that time reduced the value of a planned charitable donation of A. I. G. shares that would have been part of the settlement, and the agreement was called off. Before the trial, Judge Ramos ruled in favor of the state on one of the charges, but that was overturned on appeal, and the defense unsuccessfully sought to remove him from the case. In the Gen Re deal struck in 2000, the company was supposedly paying $10 million to get reinsurance from A. I. G. according to testimony by Christian M. Milton, a former A. I. G. executive. But A. I. G. arranged to repay the $10 million to Gen Re with a $5 million deal fee, he testified. The state charged that the ?secret? fee repayment was a sign the reinsurance was bogus, intended mainly to allow A. I. G. to increase reserves by $500 million. But Mr. Greenberg, who initiated the deal by phoning the Gen Re chief executive, testified that he was not aware of the repayment plan. In a 2008 deposition admitted into evidence early in the trial, Alice Schroeder, a former Morgan Stanley insurance analyst, said that if she had known about the Gen Re transaction and its impact in raising A. I. G. ?s   reserve levels, she ?almost certainly? would not have upgraded the stock in early 2001. She also described Mr. Greenberg as ?a very   manager. ? One cloud over the state?s case was whether a deposition of Richard Napier, a former Gen Re executive, could come into evidence. Mr. Napier was an important prosecution witness in the Connecticut trial who in 2005 pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit securities fraud in the A. I. G. deal. While the defense objected to parts of Mr. Napier?s deposition as inadmissible ?hearsay,? New York State lawyers argued that a ?  exception? to hearsay rules should apply. Judge Ramos received briefs on the issue but had not ruled before the mediation effort began."
17423,Mitch Smith and Richard P?rez-Pe?a,7/01/2017,2017,1,crime,"CHICAGO  ?   The appalling video seized the nation?s attention this week: A group of young people kidnapped, bound, beat, slashed, gagged, humiliated and threatened to kill a teenager with mental disabilities over nearly three days, and laughed about it as they carried out their acts. But by far, the most unusual thing about the episode, advocates for people with disabilities have said, was not the abuse itself, but the fact that it was recorded. Violence against people with disabilities is far more common than most people realize, advocates have said, and frequently goes undetected or is not taken seriously. The victim in the attack here, an    white man, suffered from schizophrenia and attention deficit disorder, prosecutors said in court papers filed on Friday. The four accused attackers, ranging in age from 18 to 24, are black. The four appeared on Friday in Cook County Circuit Court and Judge Maria Kuriakos Ciesil ordered them held without bail. The defendants are accused of multiple felonies, including hate crimes. Prosecutors said the victim, who was found by the police on Tuesday, was targeted based on his race and his disability. During a Facebook video made by one of the defendants, another can be heard denouncing white people, and, at one point, a man is heard saying he does not care if the victim is schizophrenic. ?I?m wondering as I?m hearing this, ?Where was the sense of decency?? ? Judge Kuriakos Ciesil asked. In explaining her denial of bail, she added, ?How do you put someone out there who has allegedly committed such horrible offenses against a person?? People with disabilities are more than twice as likely to be the victims of violent crimes as those without disabilities, according to a Justice Department report based on Census Bureau surveys. And people with mental disabilities are the most likely to be victimized. But some advocates claim the disparity is actually much greater, saying crimes against those with disabilities are less likely to be pursued by law enforcement. They believe people with disabilities may be unable to take part in a survey or go to the police, or may have trouble being understood. As a result, their complaints often are not taken seriously. ?There are probably thousands of other cases just like this one in Chicago, and in some cases worse, that will never see the impact of the justice system because folks don?t know about it,? said Rebecca Cokley, the executive director of the National Council on Disability, a federal agency. ?In a lot of cases with people with disabilities, the perpetrators are family members or caretakers, so what happens when the person who would have to take you to the police station is your abuser?? Advocates have said the underlying problem is a pervasive attitude, conscious or not, that people with disabilities are not fully human. They pointed to a recent case in Idaho, where a white high school football player was charged with shoving a coat hanger into the rectum of another teenager, who was black and had mental disabilities, after having harassed the student and directed racial slurs at him for months. Though the accused student was 18 at the time of the assault, he was sentenced to probation rather than prison. ?We have, unfortunately, devalued disabled people forever, which means we devalue their suffering,? said Curt Decker, executive director of the National Disability Rights Network, a nonprofit advocacy group. ?What we experience all the time is that police, prosecutors, judges say, ?Oh, this case is hard, it?s not worth our trouble. This person is hard to understand, or they?re not credible, or they won?t stand up to  . ?? Mr. Decker said that when Congress spent years drafting, debating, and finally voting on hate crimes legislation, which passed in 2009, it was a struggle to ensure that it punished crimes singling out people with disabilities, as well as bias based on categories like race or sex.   of the 50 states have hate crimes laws, according to the   League, but 17 of them do not specify people with disabilities as a protected group. Vilissa Thompson, an organizer of the Harriet Tubman Collective, a coalition of advocates for disabled black people, said, ?People are ignorant about the extent of violence against disabled people, but what?s worse is that there?s this kind of misplaced sympathy for the perpetrator, especially when it?s a parent or caregiver. ?"
17422,Gretchen Reynolds,10/01/2017,2017,1,lifestyle,"Is your workout getting you nowhere? Research and lived experience indicate that many people who begin a new exercise program see little if any improvement in their health and fitness even after weeks of studiously sticking with their new routine. Among fitness scientists, these people are known as ?nonresponders. ? Their bodies simply don?t respond to the exercise they are doing. And once discouraged, they often return to being nonexercisers. But an inspiring and timely new study suggests that nonresponders to one form of exercise can probably switch to another exercise regimen to which their body will respond. And a simple test you can do at home will help you determine how well your workout is working for you. One of the first major studies to report the phenomenon of nonresponders appeared in 2001, when researchers parsed data from dozens of previously published studies of running, cycling and other endurance exercise. The studies showed that, on aggregate, endurance training increased people?s endurance. But when the researchers examined individual outcomes, the variations were staggering. Some people had improved their endurance by as much as 100 percent, while others had actually become less fit, even though they were following the same workout routine. Age, sex and ethnicity had not mattered, the researchers noted. Young people and old had been outliers, as had women and men, black volunteers and white. Interestingly, nonresponse to endurance training ran in families, the researchers discovered, suggesting that genetics probably plays a significant role in how people?s bodies react to exercise. Since then, other researchers have found that people can have extremely erratic reactions to weight training regimens, with some packing on power and mass and others losing both. And a study published last year concentrating on brief bouts of intense interval training concluded that some people barely gained endurance with this type of workout, while others flourished, greatly augmenting their fitness. These studies, however, were not generally designed to tell us whether someone who failed to benefit from one form of exercise might do well with another. So for the new experiment, which was published in December in the journal PLOS One, researchers from Queen?s University in Kingston, Ontario, and the University of Ottawa decided to focus intently on whether a nonresponder to one form of exercise could benefit by switching to another. They began by gathering 21 healthy men and women and determining their VO2 max, a measure of how much oxygen the lungs can deliver to the muscles heart rates and other physiological parameters related to aerobic fitness. Then they had each volunteer complete two very different types of workouts. Each training regimen lasted three weeks, and the researchers waited several months before starting the next regimen, so that volunteers could return to their baseline fitness. One   routine involved typical endurance training: riding a stationary bicycle four times a week for 30 minutes at a moderately strenuous pace. The second type of exercise revolved around   intervals. Each volunteer completed eight   intervals of very hard pedaling on a stationary bicycle, with 10 seconds of rest after each bout. The intervals were brutal but brief. At the end of each   session, the researchers again checked each volunteer?s VO2 max and other fitness measures. As a group, they had gained admirable amounts of fitness from both workouts and to about the same extent. But individually, the responses varied considerably. About a third of the people had failed to show much if any improvement in one of the measures of fitness after three weeks of endurance training. Similarly, about a third had not improved their fitness much with interval training. And after each type of workout, some participants were found to be in worse shape. A majority of the participants, in other words, had failed to respond as expected after one of the workouts. But, importantly, no one had failed to respond at all. Every man and woman had measurably improved his or her fitness in some way after one of the sessions, if not the other. Those who had shown little response to endurance training generally showed a robust improvement after the interval sessions, and vice versa. These data suggest that ?there is no     approach to exercise,? says Brendon Gurd, an associate professor of kinesiology at Queen?s University who oversaw the study. ?But it does seem as if there is some size that fits everyone. ? The question is how to determine which form of exercise best fits you. The answer, Dr. Gurd says, is simple trial and error. Before beginning a new exercise routine, he says, measure your fitness. You can do this by briskly walking up several flights of stairs or quickly stepping onto and off a box three or four times. Then check your pulse. This is your baseline number. Now start working out. Walk. Jog. Attend interval training or spin classes. After about a month, Dr. Gurd says, repeat the stair or step test. Your pulse rate should be slower now. Your workout sessions should also be feeling easier. If not, you may be a nonresponder to your current exercise routine. In that case, switch things up, Dr. Gurd recommends. If you have primarily been walking, maybe try sprinting up a few flights of stairs and walking back down, which is a simple form of interval training. Or if you have been exercising with intervals and feeling no fitter, perhaps jog for a month or two. The message he hopes people will glean from his and other studies of exercise nonresponders ?is not that you shouldn?t bother exercising because exercise might not help you,? Dr. Gurd says. ?It does help everyone, once you find your own best exercise. ?"
18074,David E. Sanger,30/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"WASHINGTON  ?   The Trump administration defended on Sunday a reorganization of the National Security Council that elevates the president?s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon  ?   a political adviser with no direct national security role  ?   to full membership and downgrades the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The alteration was contained in a memorandum issued late Saturday defining the organization of the National Security Council and the Homeland Security Council, the top   bodies inside the White House on everything from diplomacy to counterterrorism to crisis management to nuclear and cyberpolicy. Mr. Trump?s document drew from organizational precedents in the Obama and George W. Bush administrations. But the ascension of Mr. Bannon, who until last year was the head of Breitbart News, and the diminishment of the president?s top intelligence and military advisers took Democrats and Republicans by surprise. The new memo said that the intelligence director and the Joint Chiefs chairman would attend the ?principals meetings?  ?   the meeting of   officials  ?   only when ?issues pertaining to their responsibilities and expertise are to be discussed. ? Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said Sunday that Mr. Bannon?s past service as a Navy officer merited his attendance at all meetings, as part of a ?streamlining? of  . He did not explain the downgrading of the   general who heads the Joint Chiefs, Joseph F. Dunford Jr. who rose through the Marine Corps and served in Iraq and Afghanistan. ?Well, he is a former naval officer,? Mr. Spicer said of Mr. Bannon on ABC?s ?This Week. ? ?He?s got a tremendous understanding of the world and the geopolitical landscape that we have now. ? He added, ?Having the chief strategist for the president in those meetings, who has a significant military background, to help make, guide what the president?s final analysis is going to be, is crucial. ? When pressed on General Dunford?s role, Mr. Spicer said, ?The president gets plenty of information from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ? Current and former military officials said they suspected that the decision, in part, was prompted by the national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, who retired as a   general after he was dismissed during the Obama administration as the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. It was the previous director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper, who delivered the news to Mr. Flynn that he was being removed from his post. Throughout the transition, Mr. Flynn was reportedly hesitant to place many people around the National Security Council table who had outranked him in the military. Nonetheless, there are two in the cabinet: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who retired as a   general, and the secretary of homeland security, John F. Kelly, a retired   Marine Corps general who served for 45 years, ending his military career as the commander of United States Southern Command. Both men remain principals on the council. The C. I. A. director, Mike Pompeo, is not mentioned at all in the reorganization order. A week ago, Mr. Trump went to C. I. A. headquarters to assure officers there that he had their backs and valued their contributions. But Mr. Pompeo?s predecessor, John O. Brennan, was also not a formal member of the council, though he often attended meetings to provide intelligence assessments. Susan E. Rice, Mr. Flynn?s predecessor as national security adviser, denounced the downgrading of the intelligence director and the Joint Chiefs chairman. ?This is stone cold crazy,? she wrote on Twitter. ?Who needs military advice or intell to make policy on ISIL, Syria, Afghanistan, DPRK,? she said, using abbreviations for the Islamic State and North Korea. Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, also appearing on ABC, questioned the wisdom of the move. John Bellinger, who was the counsel to the National Security Council during Mr. Bush?s administration, noted in a commentary on the Lawfare blog that Mr. Bannon?s role was highly unusual, because ?the N. S. C. function usually does not include participants from the political side of the White House. ? He noted that Karl Rove, Mr. Bush?s top political strategist, did not attend council meetings. But in the early days of the Obama administration, David Axelrod, also a top political strategist, did attend many meetings resetting policy on Afghanistan and Pakistan  ?   as a guest and an observer, but not as a full member of the council."
17817,Jon Caramanica,20/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"In an interview with CNN on Wednesday night, Thomas Barrack Jr. who heads the Presidential Inaugural Committee, was asked whether Kanye West, who vocally supported Donald J. Trump?s candidacy last year, and who visited him in Trump Tower in December following his victory, would be performing at any of the inaugural events. ?We haven?t asked him,? Mr. Barrack replied. Rather than stop there, he continued: ?It?s not the venue. The venue we have for entertainment is filled out. It?s perfect. It?s going to be typically and traditionally American. ? Following a political season in which quarrels over inclusion and exclusion in the United States  ?   in senses literal, metaphorical and philosophical  ?   were central and heated, the ?Make America Great Again! Welcome Celebration? was an opportunity to make a loud case. The stage was a potent one: the National Mall in Washington, just beneath the Lincoln Memorial. The concert was broadcast live on CNN and online. What was presented as ?typically and traditionally American,? however, veered between jingoism and vaudevillian fluff and largely ignored the contribution of   to popular music (which is to say, almost all of popular music). Instead it focused heavily on country and rock by white Southerners, including the country superstar Toby Keith, who has been the nation?s loudest musical cheerleader for a decade and a half the Mississippi   band 3 Doors Down, which was a favorite in the    2000s and the Frontmen of Country, an amalgam of   singers made famous in other bands. It was a spotty lineup, though not a wholly ineffective one. 3 Doors Down?s songs remain sturdy, and the frontman Brad Arnold?s voice was strong, though denuded of its sleazy edges. And Mr. Keith, the headliner, in a heavy overcoat and a scruffy beard, delivered potent patriotism via strong narratives. Mr. Keith isn?t as uncomplicated a choice as he might appear from a distance. In the past, he?s been a registered Democrat, and here, he thanked President Obama for his service before offering a salute to Mr. Trump. Mr. Keith?s career soared after   when his music took an aggressive turn. At this show, he played the pugnacious and proud ?Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue (The Angry American),? and also ?American Soldier,? a meditative embrace of patriotic dedication. He also played ?Beer for My Horses,? with its    endorsement of   vigilante justice: ?Take all the rope in Texas, find a tall oak   up all them bad boys, hang them high in the   all the people to see. ? Mr. Keith?s songs about America are very conscious of place, and at this show, that proved an effective strategy. The Frontmen of Country leaned heavily on songs that mentioned bucolic Southern settings: ?God Blessed Texas,? ?Amy?s Back in Austin,? ?Walking in Memphis. ? And Lee Greenwood joined them for ?God Bless the U. S. A. ,? a dour march of national pride. In total, the concert?s message was that America is a defined geographical and ideological space, with borders worth defending, even at the price of excluding those who could make the place immeasurably more fun. This concert ended up being as notable for who did not show up as for who did. The only featured nonwhite performers were Sam Moore (of the 1960s soul duo Sam  Dave) who sang a restrained ?America the Beautiful? backed by an   choir, and DJ Ravidrums, who delivered his dim, caffeinated percussive interstitials from inside a spherical   drum kit. But both of those acts got just a couple of minutes. The United States Army Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps got much more time for their    songs. When Mr. Trump first appeared onstage at the show, accompanied by his wife, Melania, it was to the Rolling Stones?s ?Heart of Stone,? a song about a man who can?t be swayed. At the end of the concert, Mr. Trump addressed the crowd briefly, thanked the performers, and suggested that hosting this event in front of the Lincoln Memorial might have been an unprecedented choice. That was not true. In 2009, Mr. Obama held a   concert here, ?We Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial. ? It included athletes, actors and musicians from across genres  ?   Mary J. Blige singing Bill Withers?s ?Lean on Me,? Pete Seeger and Bruce Springsteen singing ?This Land Is Your Land,? a song of acceptance and respect for the nation. It was a show of cosmopolitanism and inclusion that portrayed America not as a fixed idea, but as an   sum."
18005,Keith Bradsher,28/01/2017,2017,1,law,"Enjoy the guacamole as you watch the Super Bowl on Feb. 5. Some of the ingredients might be a little more expensive next year. House Republicans and President Trump have been talking about imposing a 20 percent tax on imported goods, with a White House spokesman suggesting on Thursday that such a tax might start with goods from Mexico. With the tax, the price for some heavily imported items could go up. But other foods produced mainly in the United States might become slightly cheaper. While many details remain unclear, here are a few indications of how the tax might work and how it would affect prices in the fruit and vegetable aisle at the supermarket. A third of all avocados eaten by Americans are grown in the United States and the rest are imported. More than nine of every 10 imported avocados come from Mexico, while most of the rest come from Chile, Peru and the Dominican Republic. The average retail price of an avocado varies considerably. Prices can creep up toward $1. 50 for the Super Bowl and Fourth of July, the two biggest spikes in demand. The retail price falls toward $1 apiece around Christmas, as demand falters but the trees, grown in mild, subtropical climates, keep producing. Organically grown avocados have been commanding a premium of about 30 percent lately, a premium that has widened over the last few years. The tax would not end up being 20 percent of a $1 to $1. 50 avocado, which would be 20 to 30 cents. That is because the import tax would only be on what is known a the dutiable value  ?   the wholesale price of the avocado assessed when it crosses the border. That does not include the cost of trucking it from the border to a grocery store in the United States, the store?s rent, the store?s bills for   and other utilities, or the wages for the store?s staff. None of these costs would be subject to the tax, but can help determine the retail price of the avocado. For the first 11 months of last year, the average wholesale price of avocados crossing the border was 50 cents apiece. So a 20 percent tax on that wholesale price at the border would only add a dime to the cost of each avocado. It takes four or five years for a newly planted avocado tree to bear fruit. If an import tax were to be imposed on foreign avocados, American farmers could not increase production quickly. That means many Americans might have to pay for taxed avocados imported from Mexico and elsewhere for a few years, or potentially do without. That is right  ?   a good guacamole needs onions, lime juice and a few other ingredients as well. Just look at onions. Seven out of eight onions eaten by Americans are grown in the United States. They also tend to be grown by companies  ?   even the   onion farmers tend to incorporate their farms  ?   so they owe corporate tax. That is notable because various plans being circulated call for a border tax to be used to help reduce the corporate profits tax. Right now, the corporate profits tax is 35 percent. Multinationals like Apple actually pay a lot less, in part because much of their profits are held offshore. That is harder for an onion farmer to do, although there are tax breaks for farmers. With those qualifiers, the introduction of a border tax is expected to produce enough revenue to offset the losses from lowering the tax on corporate profits to 25 percent, 20 percent or even 15 percent, depending on the proposal. That would ultimately help cut the tax bill for onion farmers. The whole idea behind the House Republicans? plan is that companies producing in the United States should pay lower taxes, so those companies can hire more workers. The tax burden would be shifted toward importers, but also toward people who buy imported goods. Companies tend to pass on the cost of taxes to consumers, while pocketing any tax savings, when there are only a few businesses in the industry and limited competition. The opposite can also be true: companies in highly competitive industries tend to pay extra taxes out of their own profits, because raising prices might result in lower market share. In those cases, they tend to pass on tax savings to consumers. Onion farmers might also use their tax savings to hire more workers and export more. The United States imports a few more onions than it exports, but most onion farmers simply grow for the domestic market. A corporate tax cut linked to a border tax might prompt them to expand globally, which is the whole idea behind a border tax. That is tough to predict, and also depends on inflation and other factors, not just the border tax. The odds are that a border tax would drive up the cost of guacamole, because avocados, not onions, account for most of the cost of making it, and most avocados are imported. But the details of the tax, and how markets respond to it, will also make a big difference."
18358,Max Fisher and Kitty Bennett,14/02/2017,2017,2,crime,"The White House has issued a list of 78 terrorist attacks, saying most were underreported. The Trump administration, under fire for immigration restrictions and other policies it says are designed to curb terrorism, has portrayed the news media and other institutions as playing down the threat. But the list, which was released on Monday night and details episodes from September 2014 to December 2016, includes dozens of attacks that were covered heavily in the news media, including by The New York Times. (Examples are included in the list below.) Just as striking was what the list excluded: attacks targeting Muslims, who make up the overwhelming majority of victims of Islamist terrorism. The list does not mention, for instance, two suicide bombings in Beirut, Lebanon, that killed dozens in November 2015, or the wave of Boko Haram attacks across northern Nigeria, which have been among the world?s deadliest terrorist assaults. Though there have been many attacks in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, the list mentions only one: a June 2016 bombing that killed Nepali and Indian security contractors. The list describes the target as ?a bus carrying Canadian Embassy guards,? which is correct but in keeping with the document?s emphasis on Western targets  ?   a focus that is sometimes misleadingly narrow. Prominent attacks carried out by   are also conspicuously omitted. In June 2015, Dylann S. Roof opened fire in a predominantly black church in Charleston, S. C. killing nine. That November, three people were shot to death at a Planned Parenthood office in Colorado Springs. Robert L. Dear Jr. describing himself as a ?warrior for the babies,? acknowledged that he had carried out the attack, but he was later declared mentally unfit to stand trial. And in at least one of the attacks on the list, terrorism has been ruled out. A knife attack that killed two British backpackers at a hostel in Queensland, Australia, was found to be a common crime, not one related to terrorism, the Queensland police have said.   violence has been rising in the United States, according to a recent report by the New America Foundation, and has in some years claimed more lives than Islamist attacks in the country. The White House?s list, by focusing on a significant but narrow slice of terrorism, feeds into perceptions that the administration is seeking to target Muslims with other policies, particularly its immigration restrictions against predominantly Muslim countries. Here is the list from the White House, along with our references to news coverage. Some names from the list have been edited to correct spelling.

17787,Sopan Deb and Katie Rogers,20/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"WASHINGTON  ?   No Beyonc?. No Jon Bon Jovi. No U2. But no matter: For many of the thousands gathering at the Lincoln Memorial on Thursday afternoon for the preinaugural concert, the artists in the lineup were secondary to the chance to celebrate the coming presidency of Donald J. Trump. The day?s programming was heavy on country music, ?God Bless America,? and a hefty number of bagpipes. Two friends, Kim Shourds and Susan Perkins Lovelady, drove in from Norfolk, Va. to attend the evening?s concerts. They danced and sang along to ?God Blessed Texas,? but as they took a break, they said the volatile political climate wasn?t far from their minds. ?This is a celebration of America,? Ms. Perkins Lovelady, 53, said. ?After all of the negativity of the past year, all of the positivity is a good thing. It?s a heartsore country. ? Kenny and Katherine Dunham decided to make the   drive from Kinston, N. C. after hearing that Representative John Lewis of Georgia would boycott Mr. Trump?s inauguration. The Dunhams were not fazed by the lack of   entertainers. ?I think if they don?t want to perform, they shouldn?t perform,? Mr. Dunham, 60, said. ?But at the same time, my understanding is they weren?t asked to. Toby Keith is going to perform. Lee Greenwood is going to perform. ? Some of the loudest cheers of the evening were for Jon Voight, the only   Hollywood actor to lend his name to the event, as he spoke to the crowd about the ?barrage of propaganda? that Mr. Trump had faced in his race to the presidency. ?He certainly didn?t need this job,? Mr. Voight said of Mr. Trump. ?And yes, God answered all of our prayers. ? Mr. Voight then introduced Sam Moore, one half of the duo Sam  Dave, who performed a soulful rendition of ?America the Beautiful. ? Mr. Trump made his first appearance about an hour into the show  ?   called the ?Make America Great Again! Welcome Celebration?  ?   when he walked down the steps of the Lincoln Memorial with his wife, Melania. He turned and saluted Lincoln?s statue, then descended the steps with a small wave and gave his supporters a thumbs up. Mr. Trump and his family watched the performance of the Frontmen of Country, a group featuring three lead singers: Richie McDonald of Lonestar, Larry Stewart of Restless Heart, and Tim Rushlow, formerly of Little Texas. They played a medley that included a cover of Marc Cohn?s ?Walking In Memphis? and Lonestar?s hit ?I?m Already There. ? Mr. Greenwood then joined for a performance of ?God Bless the U. S. A. ?  ?   Mr. Trump?s   song during the campaign. The   could be seen mouthing the words of the song on the side of the stage, to the delight of the crowd. After the performance, Mr. Trump pumped his fist, and embraced the musicians as they walked off stage. The audience was subdued for 3 Doors Down, an alternative rock band that hasn?t made the Billboard Top 10 chart since 2003, and the Piano Guys, a group featuring a cellist and pianist that is known for its eclectic covers of pop songs. However, it was Mr. Keith, the country star and the night?s biggest draw, who brought the National Mall roaring back to life. There has never been a president crossing over so directly from the   world as Mr. Trump, who remains an executive producer of ?The Celebrity Apprentice? and has cultivated big names in Hollywood for decades (even making a ?Home Alone 2? cameo). Yet those big names are shunning his inauguration, including Thursday?s event, unlike the Lincoln Memorial concert in 2009 for President Obama that featured Beyonc? and other stars. The artists who are showing up are reflective of the   of the United States that buoyed Mr. Trump to victory in November, while belying the opulence he is known for. Standing by the memorial?s reflecting pool a few hours before the show, John Stephan, a    retired banker, said he left California on Tuesday to be part of the festivities and snagged a ticket to the concert at the last minute. As for the various entertainers who had snubbed the concert  ?   or even said yes and then backpedaled  ?   Mr. Stephan was dismissive. ?I think it?s sad when anybody says, you know, ?My opinion of a person?s more important than let?s just get the country going,?? he said. Lines to get into the show began forming in the morning. About 5, 000 tickets were available, and the crowd steadily filled the empty spots near the memorial and on the mall by the start of the show. Along the streets leading to the memorial, people pulled wagons full of homemade Trump merchandise, including Make America Great Again hats and Trump scarves. Rick Storm traveled in from Philadelphia with a backpack full of $10   to sell. By 1 p. m. he had sold only one  . ?I just started,? Mr. Storm said. Sitting on the ground near the reflecting pool, Tom Boatman and his wife, Kathy, were resting and waiting for headliners to start. They had driven from Cookeville, Tenn. to attend the inauguration. The couple said they were both looking forward to the concerts, but the big priority for them was to see Mr. Trump take office. ?It?ll be over this time tomorrow,? Mr. Boatman, who works as a plant operations manager, said of Mr. Obama?s administration. ?I didn?t vote for him, but I had hope. ? Mr. Trump?s campaign, as some of his supporters see it, was never about fitting in with the Hollywood crowd. Thursday?s lineup suited them just fine. Truth be told, they didn?t want Beyonc? anyway. They wanted Mr. Trump, who was expected to speak at the concert. ?That?ll be the highlight,? Mr. Stephan said. At the closing of the show, Mr. Trump gave the crowd what it wanted. ?You?re not forgotten anymore,? he said as part of his brief remarks. With that, a massive fireworks display started over the Lincoln Memorial, including one firework that formed the letters ?U. S. A. ?"
18039,"Rod Nordland, Joe Cochrane and Patrick Kingsley",10/03/2017,2017,3,politics,"BEIRUT, Lebanon  ?   Sardar Hussain refused to believe it. He had been orphaned in Afghanistan by a Taliban bomb at age 13. After waiting in limbo for two years, he said he was only days away from getting on a plane to the United States when he heard that President Trump would be barring entry to refugees. Mustafa did believe it. He teared up, saying his life was over at age 28. An Iraqi refugee in Lebanon, he thought he was so close to getting to the United States that he had gone out and bought a new shirt for his trip. When she read on Facebook about the temporary ban, Alwia Abdullah, 43, who fled from Darfur in Sudan to Jordan with her husband and six children, got a sudden, stabbing pain in her gut, and couldn?t sleep. ?We left because we were discriminated against in Darfur,? she said. ?So to be discriminated against by a U. S. president, by a nation we see our future in, is so disheartening. How do you live with that?? They were among an estimated 110, 000 people in line to be processed for resettlement in the United States during this fiscal year. In fact, they thought they had already made it through the rigorous vetting procedure and, after years of waiting, were on the verge of having their hopes realized. Now, all are suddenly, indefinitely waiting again, barred from entry to the United States for at least four months, according to an executive order signed by Mr. Trump on Friday, with no assurances of what could happen to them next. The order, Mr. Trump said, is a way to ?keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America. ? ?We don?t want them here,? he said at the Pentagon. ?We want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas. ? The executive order calls for the United States? annual refugee quota to be cut to a maximum of 50, 000, compared with 85, 000 allowed in during the fiscal year ending in September 2016. Even last year?s figure was dwarfed by the historically high number of displaced people in the world, 65 million, or by the more than 1. 5 million migrants and refugees arriving in European countries since 2014. Mr. Trump?s order also suspends the entry of all Syrian refugees indefinitely, calling their arrival ?detrimental to the interests of the United States. ? Beyond that, it suspends visas to people from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen for 90 days. Asked about Mr. Trump?s refugee ban, St?phane Dujarric, the United Nations spokesman, said he hoped ?it?s a temporary one. ? He noted that more people were displaced around the world than ever before. ?The U. S. resettlement program is one of the most important resettlement programs the U. N. works with,? he said. Mr. Trump?s action was the latest closed door in a world that has become increasingly unwelcome to refugees, amid rising concerns and hostility in many resettlement countries in Europe, and in countries of first refuge like Turkey and Lebanon. For those refugees, in particular, who thought that their asylum process was over and that they would be accepted in the United States, the dismay was overwhelming this past week. Faten Diab, 34, a former charity worker from Syria, said she had been told that she and her family would be among a relatively small number of Syrians allowed into the United States. Last year, only 10, 000 had been granted that privilege, compared with 40, 000 in Canada. Ms. Diab and her husband said she fled to Turkey and applied for asylum in the United States in summer 2015, along with close friends who applied at the same time. They said the friends had received a final decision just over a week ago and had flown to America. The Diabs had reason to hope that their own number would come up any day. Now, that may never happen. Reached by telephone in their tiny apartment in Turkey, Ms. Diab sounded distraught, as the couple?s    daughter could be heard playing in the background. ?We are so, so, so sad,? Ms. Diab said, complaining that Mr. Trump?s claim that terrorists were slipping in as refugees was overblown. ?The process of resettlement is long and difficult. You can say he is wrong. Because he didn?t live the application steps in all its difficulties. ? Strictly speaking, America does not actually owe anything to the Diabs from Syria or the Abdullahs from Darfur they are just reacting to its historical promise to take the world?s ?huddled masses yearning to breathe free. ? But in other countries, like Iraq, citizens who worked for the American military, government and companies were promised preferential treatment for resettlement. Many thought that the risks they took on behalf of the United States would be repaid one day with a safe haven when they needed it. Now Iraqis are also on Mr. Trump?s proscribed list. Laith   37, was one of many who could not believe it. A former interpreter for the United States military, he was wounded twice in battle, in the leg and stomach, and now lives in fear of retaliation from   militants in his Baghdad community. He was not ashamed to beg. ?Please Mr. President, you are the president of one of the biggest states in the world,? he said. ?Don?t be hasty in taking this decision. Be fair with us. ? Mustafa, the    Iraqi, is a Shiite Muslim who worked on construction crews on American bases, mostly on fortifications. As he put it: ?I made homes for them that kept them safe. I felt I was doing something good for humanity. ? But   militias in his neighborhood discovered what his job had been and accused him of treason. ?I was beaten and shot and knifed and eventually came to Lebanon two years ago,? he said, during an interview arranged in Beirut by the International Refugee Assistance Project, a New   legal aid group. After years of interviews and investigation, Mustafa said he was finally told to take his medical examination and now only needed to be given the date for his flight, to California. To get ready, Mustafa splurged at a   Beirut store to buy the clothes he would wear into his new life: dark green pants, a vest, a checked shirt in four colors. ?I would wear the best clothes I have, and I wouldn?t take anything else with me, not even my memories,? he said. Mustafa still has some hope that somehow exceptions will be made, which is why  ?   like most of the refugees interviewed for this article  ?   he did not want his full name published. ?If I do get rejected,? he said, ?I?d regret ever having shaken hands with an American. ? He struggled not to weep. Sardar Hussain, 16, an ethnic Hazara boy from central Afghanistan, was rocked by disbelief. He said that when he was 13, his father, mother and younger sister were killed when a bomb blew up a taxi that was taking his mother to a hospital. After paying a smuggling network $7, 000 to get him to Australia, he was marooned en route, on the Indonesian island of Java, when Australia cracked down on boats bringing refugees there. For seven weeks, he slept on the sidewalk behind the United Nations offices in Jakarta, Indonesia. Now, after more than two years, he said, his flight to America was scheduled for Monday. ?We were given a commitment to go there,? he said, speaking softly in English at a coffee house in Jakarta, just after completing his final medical exam. Firas   23, a Syrian refugee in Turkey, went out with friends on Wednesday night to drink away his disappointment. He was a university student and opposition activist in Syria before fleeing his hometown, Raqqa, now the Islamic State?s de facto capital. He was still looking for answers. ?Is Trump trying to fight the terrorists by giving up on the victims of the very same terrorists?? he asked. ?ISIS wants to destroy our lives, and now Trump declined to give us one. ? Sara, 31, a former television presenter who fled to Indonesia from Afghanistan after death threats  ?   the Taliban and other cultural conservatives despise seeing Afghan women in public at all, let alone on television  ?   was trying to arrive at answers of her own. ?You just wait,? she said. ?You see how the years pass. You get older, you cannot make any plans. You watch your dreams die with every second you spend waiting. ? After three years and four months, she thought that the waiting was finally over, and that she would soon have a date when she was allowed to fly. Now her life has been suspended for at least four more months, with no guarantee that she will still be included in the Trump administration?s   refugee quota once the visa moratorium is lifted. ?The bitter truth,? she said, ?is that your whole life is dependent on a single decision of someone who doesn?t have even the slightest idea what it?s like to live as a refugee. ?"
17609,Mujib Mashal,14/01/2017,2017,1,crime,"KABUL, Afghanistan  ?   A United States military investigation into claims of civilian casualties during a joint operation by Afghan and American forces found that 33 civilians were killed and 27 others were wounded during a firefight and airstrikes in Kunduz Province last year, American military officials said on Thursday. In early November, Afghan Special Forces, accompanied by American military advisers, came under intense fire during an operation to arrest Taliban commanders in Boz Qandahari, a village in Kunduz, the United States military command in Afghanistan said in a statement. They called in American airstrikes, which resulted in some of the civilian casualties. Two American soldiers and three Afghan commandos were killed, and four American soldiers and 11 commandos were wounded, the statement said. ?Regardless of the circumstances, I deeply regret the loss of innocent lives,? said Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr. the commander of United States forces in Afghanistan. ?On this occasion, the Taliban chose to hide amongst civilians and then attacked Afghan and U. S. forces. ? ?I wish to assure President Ghani and the people of Afghanistan that we will take all possible measures to protect Afghan civilians,? he added, referring to Ashraf Ghani. After the battle in Kunduz, a New York Times reporter counted 22 bodies being brought into the city on the way to the hospital there. Among them were 14 children, four women, two older men and two men of fighting age. They were accompanied by a large group of protesters from Boz Qandahari, the village that was hit. Residents of Boz Qandahari, however, said that the investigation had underestimated the number of civilians killed and that the claim of Taliban firing at the forces from their homes was not true. ?My father was a shopkeeper  ?   he had a grocery shop close to our house. My brother and I were farmers. We had never had a weapon. I and no one in my family knows how to use a weapon,? said Mohammed Reza, 29, who lost seven family members in the bombing and was stuck in the rubble of their house for hours. ?I lost my father, my brother, my brother?s wife, my son and three of my nephews who were between 1 and 7 years old. ? Dad Mohammed, 45, said he was aware of at least 37 killed among his own relatives. ?There were no Taliban among us, there was no Taliban in our house. Except for one former Talib, who was disabled and had lost a leg and he was our cousin,? he said. ?He was killed along with his father, his wife and five children. His brother was also killed. ? Mr. Mohammed said the Taliban stronghold in the area was obvious, but it was far from the areas that had been bombed. ?This was an act of oppression,? he said. ?We are also humans. It should be investigated by an international court, and we need to be compensated for our loss. ? Kunduz is also where a United States military gunship mistakenly targeted a hospital run by Doctors Without Borders in October 2015, killing at least 42 people and destroying much of the hospital."
18296,Peter Baker,6/02/2017,2017,2,business,"WASHINGTON  ?   President Trump is barreling into a confrontation with the courts barely two weeks after taking office, foreshadowing years of legal battles as an administration determined to disrupt the existing order presses the boundaries of executive power. Lawyers for the administration were ordered to submit a brief on Monday defending Mr. Trump?s order temporarily banning refugees from around the world and all visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States. An appeals court in California refused on Sunday to reinstate the ban after a lower court blocked it. As people from the countries targeted by Mr. Trump struggled to make their way to the United States while they could, the president for the second day in a row expressed rage at the judge in the case, this time accusing him of endangering national security. Vice President Mike Pence defended the president?s tone, but lawyers and lawmakers of both parties said Mr. Trump?s comments reflected a lack of respect for the constitutional system of checks and balances. Late in the day, Mr. Trump took to Twitter to   blame the judge and the judiciary for what the president suggested would be a future terrorist attack. ?Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril,? Mr. Trump wrote, a day after referring to the ?  judge? in the case. ?If something happens blame him and court system. ? Even before the latest post, Republicans joined Democrats in chiding him. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said it was ?best not to single out judges. ? ?We all get disappointed from time to time,? he said on CNN?s ?State of the Union. ? ?I think it is best to avoid criticizing judges individually. ? The White House offered no evidence for Mr. Trump?s suggestion that potential terrorists would now pour over the border because of the judge?s order. Since Sept. 11, 2001, no American has been killed in a terrorist attack on American soil by anyone who immigrated from any of the seven countries named in Mr. Trump?s order. The impassioned debate over the immigration order brought to the fore issues at the heart of the Trump presidency. A businessman with no experience in public office, Mr. Trump has shown in his administration?s opening days that he favors an   approach with little regard for the two other branches of government. While Congress, controlled by Republicans, has deferred, the judiciary may emerge as the major obstacle for Mr. Trump. Democrats and some Republicans said Mr. Trump?s attack on the courts would color the battle over the nomination of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court as well as the president?s relationship with Congress. Other presidents have clashed with the judiciary. The Supreme Court invalidated parts of Franklin D. Roosevelt?s New Deal, forced Richard M. Nixon to turn over Watergate tapes and rejected Bill Clinton?s bid to delay a sexual harassment lawsuit. The last two presidents battled with courts repeatedly over the limits of their power. The judiciary ruled that George W. Bush overstepped his bounds in denying due process to terrorism suspects and that Barack Obama assumed power he did not have to allow millions of unauthorized immigrants to stay in the country. Charles Fried, solicitor general under Ronald Reagan, said the ruling by a Federal District Court in Washington State blocking Mr. Trump?s order resembled a ruling by a Texas district court stopping Mr. Obama from proceeding with his own immigration order. But rarely, if ever, has a president this early in his tenure, and with such personal invective, battled the courts. Mr. Trump, Mr. Fried said, is turning everything into ?a soap opera? with overheated attacks on the judge. ?There are no lines for him,? said Mr. Fried, who teaches at Harvard Law School and voted against Mr. Trump. ?There is no notion of, this is inappropriate, this is indecent, this is unpresidential. ? Other Republicans brushed off the attacks, noting that judges have lifetime tenure that protects them from criticism. But even some Republicans said Mr. Trump?s order raised valid legal questions for the courts. ?If I were in the White House, I?d feel better about my position if the ban or moratorium or whatever you call it were based on an actual attack or threat,? former Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales, who served under Mr. Bush, said in an interview. Still, he said, when it comes to noncitizens overseas, ?the executive has enjoyed great deference from the courts. ? Judge James Robart, a Federal District Court judge in Seattle appointed by Mr. Bush, on Friday issued a nationwide suspension of Mr. Trump?s order while its legality was debated. The administration quickly asked the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to overrule the judge, but it refused early Sunday and instead ordered the government to file a brief on Monday. The quick briefing schedule indicated that the appeals court could issue a ruling on the merits of the president?s order within days. In the meantime, refugees vetted by the government can proceed to the United States, as can any travelers with approved visas from the seven targeted nations: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Still, widespread confusion and anger were reported at overseas airports on Sunday. Unsure which orders to follow, airlines stopped even some of the people named in the lawsuits who were technically cleared to come to the country, according to a government official. The assertion of broad latitude by the president in areas of national security resembles the struggles of the Bush years, when in the months after the Sept. 11 attacks the administration claimed sometimes sweeping power in the name of fighting terrorism. Jack Goldsmith, who as head of the Justice Department?s Office of Legal Counsel under Mr. Bush argued that some of the initial orders went too far and forced them to be rolled back, said on Sunday that there were similarities. ?But Bush?s legal directives were not as sloppy as Trump?s,? he said. ?And Trump?s serial attacks on judges and the judiciary take us into new territory. The sloppiness and aggressiveness of the directives, combined with the attacks on judges, put extra pressure on judges to rule against Trump. ? This was not the first time Mr. Trump has castigated a judge who ruled against him. As a candidate last year, Mr. Trump asserted that Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel, who was presiding over a fraud lawsuit by former students of Trump University, had a conflict of interest because his family was of Mexican heritage and he therefore would be biased because of Mr. Trump?s promise to build a border wall. Such comments from a sitting president, however, were unusual and triggered consternation in the legal community. Bartholomew J. Dalton, the president of the American College of Trial Lawyers, called Mr. Trump?s ?insulting language? inappropriate. ?It is wrong for the chief executive of the executive branch to demean a member of the judiciary with such language,? Mr. Dalton said in a statement. ?This undermines judicial independence, which is the backbone to our constitutional democracy. ? Senators of both parties appearing on Sunday talk shows concurred. ?I?ll be honest, I don?t understand language like that,? Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, said on ?This Week? on ABC. ?We don?t have   judges. We don?t have   senators. We don?t have   presidents. We have people from three different branches of government who take an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution. ? ?The president is not a dictator,? Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the Judiciary Committee?s top Democrat, said on ?Fox News Sunday. ? ?The framers of our Constitution wanted a strong Congress for the very reason that most of these kinds of things should be done within the scope of lawmaking. This is done within the scope of executive power. ? It fell to Mr. Pence to defend Mr. Trump. ?Well, look, the president of the United States has every right to criticize the other two branches of government. And we have a long tradition of that in this country,? he said on ?Meet the Press? on NBC. ?The judge?s actions in this case,? he added, ?making decisions about American foreign policy and national security, it?s just very frustrating to the president, to our whole administration, to millions of Americans who want to see judges that will uphold the law and recognize the authority the president of the United States has under the Constitution to manage who comes into this country. ?"
17836,"Michael S. Schmidt, Eric Lipton and Charlie Savage",23/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"WASHINGTON  ?   Hours after President Trump took his oath on Friday, the Justice Department issued an opinion saying that his appointment of his    Jared Kushner, as a senior White House adviser would be lawful despite a federal antinepotism law. In a   opinion signed on Friday, a longtime career lawyer in the Justice Department?s Office of Legal Counsel said that the president?s special hiring authority exempted White House positions from a 1967 law barring the president from employing relatives at a federal agency. Some legal experts had raised concerns that Mr. Kushner?s appointment violated that law, which Congress enacted several years after President John F. Kennedy had appointed his brother Robert as attorney general. But the new Justice Department opinion, signed by Daniel L. Koffsky, a deputy assistant attorney general in the legal counsel office, said Mr. Trump had the power to appoint Mr. Kushner anyway because of a subsequent 1978 law that gives the president the authority to appoint White House staff members without regard to other laws restricting employment and compensation of federal employees. Mr. Koffsky?s opinion acknowledged that in several cases since 1978, the Office of Legal Counsel had determined that the antinepotism statute prevented presidents from appointing relatives to positions. ?Although our conclusion today departs from some of that prior work, we think that this departure is fully justified,? he wrote. The revised position came after an effort by Jamie S. Gorelick, Mr. Kushner?s lawyer and a deputy attorney general during the Clinton administration who is now a lawyer at the firm WilmerHale, to clear away obstacles to Mr. Kushner?s appointment. The opinion paves the way for Mr. Kushner, 35, to join Mr. Trump in the West Wing. Among the new president?s closest advisers during the campaign, Mr. Kushner married Mr. Trump?s daughter Ivanka in 2009. He has run his family?s vast real estate company and has owned a newspaper, The New York Observer. Mr. Trump announced on Jan. 9 that he would appoint Mr. Kushner, who will not accept a salary. His purview is expected to include the Middle East and Israel, government partnerships with the private sector and matters involving free trade. ?If you can?t produce peace in the Middle East, nobody can,? Mr. Trump said to Mr. Kushner at an event on Thursday. The appointment of Mr. Kushner will be a dramatic change. In 1977, for example, the Justice Department barred President Jimmy Carter from appointing his son to an unpaid White House role, citing the antinepotism law. Even after Congress enacted the 1978 law, the Justice Department continued to block proposed appointments of presidential relatives. Mr. Koffsky?s opinion, which he worked on in the final days of the Obama administration, acknowledged a 1983 case in which the office barred President Ronald Reagan from appointing a relative to an advisory committee, and a 2009 case in which it blocked President Barack Obama from appointing his    and a half sister to advisory committees. But, Mr. Koffsky maintained, those opinions failed to adequately address the impact of the special hiring authority that Congress gave the president for his personal staff as part of the 1978 law. He also wrote that it was unlikely that Congress could bar a president from obtaining informal, ad hoc policy advice from a relative, and a major consequence of allowing Mr. Kushner?s appointment to a formal role is that he will be subject to the usual ethics rules for White House employees, like    laws. Mr. Kushner intends to sell some assets to his brother and to put others into a trust overseen by his mother, said Ms. Gorelick, who has worked on the plan. Ms. Gorelick said she had been consulting with federal ethics officials to try to address any    issues associated with Mr. Kushner?s appointment. He will also be required to file a financial disclosure report that details his assets and income, and to divest some holdings that could create a conflict of interest. When Mr. Trump announced Mr. Kushner?s appointment, Ms. Gorelick told reporters that while there were arguments on both sides of the legal question, she believed the ?better argument? was that it would be lawful. She also disclosed then that the Trump transition team would seek an Office of Legal Counsel opinion. In an email on Saturday, Ms. Gorelick said that ?we believed that we had the better argument on this,? adding that ?the Office of Legal Counsel of the Justice Department  ?   in an opinion by a highly regarded career deputy assistant attorney general  ?   adopted a position consistent with our own. ? Richard W. Painter, who served as a White House lawyer in the George W. Bush administration, said that while he had some doubts about the new opinion, ?it is a reasonable interpretation? of the law. ?But what is important now,? he added, ?is that Mr. Kushner complies with the    and disclosure provisions, and I wish his    the president, would do the same. ?"
17695,Abby Goodnough,17/01/2017,2017,1,science,"ROSWELL, Ga.  ?   It was 1 in the morning, and the orthopedic surgeon on call was preparing to operate on a woman whose foot had been shattered in a car wreck, after hours of tending to other patients. The woman?s husband, Jeff Anderson, asked him, ?Are you too tired to do this?? ?He looked me straight in the eye  ?   very quiet guy  ?   and said, ?I was born to do this,?? Mr. Anderson recalled. The surgeon that night more than 20 years ago was Representative Tom Price of Georgia,   Donald J. Trump?s nominee for secretary of health and human services, the cabinet official who will lead the new administration?s efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. Since then, the assuredness that defined Mr. Price as a surgeon has carried into his political career. He has always listened politely to other viewpoints but never swerved from his policy mission to protect his former profession from what he views as   government intrusion. Many who knew Mr. Price as a doctor here in Atlanta?s affluent northern suburbs praise his commitment to his patients. But his legislative record shows that over eight years in the Georgia Senate and 12 years in Congress, he has advocated at least as much for physician groups and health care companies  ?   seeking to limit damages in malpractice cases, for instance, and voting against legislation that would have required the government to negotiate lower drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries. Mr. Price has routinely argued that patients are the driving force behind his efforts. Still, his positions have often coincided with the financial interests of groups whose donations have helped advance his political career. Doctors themselves are sharply divided over his nomination, and some are particularly galled by Mr. Price?s enmity for the Affordable Care Act and opposition to abortion rights. Some of his positions even clash with those of Mr. Trump, who wants to pressure pharmaceutical companies on drug prices, for example, and has pledged to largely leave Medicare alone. If confirmed, Mr. Price, 62, will soon have far more power to influence the nation?s vast health care system than he ever did as a lawmaker. One of his first tasks would be to help Mr. Trump and Republicans in Congress determine how to eviscerate and replace the health law, a goal he has held since the law?s passage in 2010. But as leader of the agency that oversees Medicare, Medicaid, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Mr. Price would also hold considerable regulatory power, with the ability to influence everything from how applications to market new drugs are reviewed to how doctors are compensated for treating elderly and poor patients. As Mr. Price prepares for two confirmation hearings  ?   the first of which is scheduled for Wednesday  ?   his past efforts on behalf of   companies, which have donated generously to his campaigns, are under scrutiny. So, too, is Mr. Price?s history of trading in biomedical, pharmaceutical and health insurance stocks while serving on the health subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee. Democrats have called for investigations into whether he traded stock based on information he gleaned as a congressman. Last year, Mr. Price bought stock in a company that makes orthopedic implants shortly before introducing legislation that could have protected the company, Zimmer Biomet, from financial losses due to a new federal regulation. The regulation sought to rein in spending on joint replacements for Medicare patients Mr. Price?s legislation would have delayed its implementation. After he introduced it, Zimmer?s political action committee contributed to his   campaign the string of events was first reported Monday by CNN. Phillip J. Blando, a spokesman for the Trump transition team, said Mr. Price ?had no knowledge or input into the purchase? of the Zimmer stock, which he said was made by a broker. Asked why Mr. Price had not directed his broker to avoid buying   stocks while he wrote and voted on health legislation, Mr. Blando said, ?We know that other members of Congress, including Democrats, have holdings in health care stocks and vote on   legislation. ? In a letter to an ethics lawyer at the Department of Health and Human Services last week Mr. Price said he would divest himself of holdings in 43   and other stocks to avoid conflicts of interest. Noting that the Office of Government Ethics had completed an ?exhaustive review? of Mr. Price?s financial holdings, Mr. Blando said last week that Mr. Price ?takes his obligation to uphold the public trust very seriously. ? Although not among the billionaires whom Mr. Trump has tapped for his cabinet, Mr. Price has profited from medicine, both as a doctor and as an active investor in health   companies including Aetna,   Squibb and Zimmer Biomet, which makes artificial joints and other medical devices. He has an estimated net worth of $13. 6 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, with assets that include real estate. He has also been an effective  : Even in his first run for office in 1996, his war chest of $173, 000, much of which came from doctors and medical companies, led his poorly financed Democratic opponent to call him ?Dr. Dollar. ? A brisk,   workaholic who relishes the granular details of legislative proposals and process, Mr. Price expressed concern last year about Mr. Trump?s grasp of the issues. Taking questions from a student group at Emory University, he said he had voted for Marco Rubio in the Republican primary and called Mr. Trump an ?empty policy vessel? who was ?dangerous for politics and the economy,? according to the student newspaper. Mr. Price, who declined to be interviewed, was engaged in a number of pitched partisan battles even before coming to Washington in 2005. In the Georgia Legislature, he voted against a new state flag that minimized the Confederate battle cross and supported a constitutional amendment banning   marriage. In Congress, he has taken stances seen as antithetical to public health, opposing regulating tobacco as a drug and favoring legislation that would make it easier to sell bullets that can pierce armor. He has also written a fairly detailed plan for replacing the Affordable Care Act. It would repeal the law?s expansion of Medicaid and provide tax credits to help with the cost of coverage based on age instead of income, with older people getting higher credits. Mr. Price grew up in Dearborn, Mich. the son and grandson of doctors who heavily influenced his career choice. He has publicly recalled making house calls with his grandfather, who practiced medicine into his 90s. After medical school at the University of Michigan, he moved to Georgia, completing his residency at Emory and setting up practice in Roswell, a relatively affluent, conservative suburb of Atlanta. In the 1990s, his practice, Compass Orthopedics, was among seven in the Atlanta area that merged into a large group that became known as Resurgens Orthopaedics. It became the largest orthopedic practice in Georgia, and now has 100 doctors and 1, 000 employees spread over 21 locations. Dr. Steven B. Wertheim, another founding partner of Resurgens, said one goal of the consolidation was to gain bargaining power with insurance companies and to provide M. R. I. s, physical therapy and even certain outpatient operations   rather than referring patients to other providers or operating at hospitals. More leverage with insurers often allows doctors to extract higher rates. ?His overall gist was, ?Look, if all we did was practice good medicine, we?d be broke by tomorrow,?? Dr. Wertheim said of Mr. Price. ?He understood the need to run a business. ? As a physician, Mr. Price was constantly frustrated by having to seek insurance companies? approval for his patients to get an expensive diagnostic test or physical therapy  ?   a common complaint among specialists. Similarly, he resented when federal health regulators intervened in something he and his partners thought they were already doing well, like using electronic medical records. ?Those are the things that drove him crazy,? Dr. Wertheim said. His resentment of government intervention in medicine drove Mr. Price to become involved in the Medical Association of Georgia early in his career, and his work there led him to run for office in 1995, when the House seat in his district opened up. But by 2002, as his legislative duties increased, he traded his suburban practice for a job at Grady Memorial Hospital, a vast, chaotic, aging complex, just a few blocks from the State Capitol. For the next two years, Mr. Price was the medical director of Grady?s orthopedic clinic, seeing a vastly different population than the   privately insured patients he was used to. Most of Grady?s patients are poor and black, and many lack any form of insurance. Long waits for care are the norm, and trauma, including gunshot wounds, is a big part of the caseload. ?He called me and asked if there was a position,? said Dr. James R. Roberson, the chairman of the orthopedics department at Emory University School of Medicine, whose residents train at Grady. ?He needed some flexibility  ?   that was most of his impetus to want to return to Grady, because he was really very interested in pursuing a political career. ? Dr. Roberson said that Mr. Price played a ?unique role? at the clinic, training residents and overseeing patient care but also seeking to address inefficiencies  ?   long wait times, for example  ?   and representing the clinic at hospital administrative meetings. Although he saw patients, he did not perform surgery or need to be on call at night  ?   an unusual arrangement, Dr. Roberson said. In the Legislature, Mr. Price spent his first six years in the powerless minority, although he quickly rose to the position of minority whip. His fortunes changed in 2003, after Sonny Perdue became the first Republican governor since Reconstruction and persuaded enough Democrats to switch parties to put the Senate into Republican hands. As the majority leader, Mr. Price?s intimate knowledge of procedural rules and maneuvers, gleaned from assiduous research, helped advance his party?s agenda. In the state Legislature, he was the leader who delivered bad news, the   tactician to some of his   colleagues? more backslapping style. His sense of humor, when he used it, was dry. Colleagues often wondered if he slept. ?He?s a machine,? said Russell K. Paul, a Republican who served in the State Senate with Mr. Price. During his two years in the majority, Mr. Price?s top priority was curbing the rising cost of medical malpractice insurance, which he said was forcing hospitals and nursing homes to close and forcing doctors to limit which procedures they performed. ?He was very bright, articulate, and smart enough to be able to see the different sides,? said Tom Bordeaux, a former Democratic state lawmaker and trial lawyer who negotiated with Mr. Price over a package of bills Mr. Price introduced to limit doctors? liability in malpractice cases. ?But he was just totally unwilling. He was very gracious and he was completely inflexible. ? Ultimately, Mr. Price failed to persuade even his Republican colleagues to accept a provision that would have capped    damages for malpractice victims at $250, 000. Mr. Paul, now the mayor of Sandy Springs, Ga. said Mr. Price had become more partisan during his last few years in the Legislature, when the Republicans saw an opportunity to tip the balance of power in their favor for the first time since Reconstruction. ?There was not a lot of bipartisan collegiality when it came to trying to control the government in Georgia,? Mr. Paul said, ?and that environment was the crucible that began to turn Tom into a hardened political warrior. ? In Congress, Mr. Price has made frequent speeches to health industry and physician groups, and has occasionally introduced legislation on their behalf. Last year, for example, he sponsored a bill fighting new lower Medicare payment rates for ?durable medical equipment? like wheelchairs and canes. A few months later, he spoke at a conference for companies that supply such equipment, which held a $     on his behalf that same day. Mr. Price has also supported proposals to overhaul Medicare  ?   potentially putting him at odds with his new boss, Mr. Trump, who has pledged not to ?touch? the program. Speaking to a student group at the University of Michigan in 2015, Mr. Price expressed concern that Mr. Trump would not listen to others, including Congress, if elected. ?When I hear Trump saying things like, ?I?ll just do XYZ,? without seemingly any regard for the legislative branch,? Mr. Price told the group, ?it gives me some thought. ?"
18408,Ruth La Ferla,8/02/2017,2017,2,entertainment,"Was it just a year ago that Katie Holmes, Jennifer Hudson and Lucy Liu snatched up most of the light and much of the air at Zac Posen?s fall show? A scant six months later, Mr. Posen was host to a somewhat less lustrous contingent, one that included Malin Akerman, Kelly Bensimon and Olivia Culpo. (Who?) Last February, Claire Danes, Laura Linney and Amy Schumer lent their aggregate star power to Narciso Rodriguez?s show. By September, the designer?s paparazzi bait was confined to a lineup highlighted by Jessica Alba and Jessica Seinfeld. So it went. And now, on the eve of another round of New York shows, it seems safe to predict a similar thinning of celebrity ranks, as top film and music personalities disappear from their gilded   perches, their dwindling presence matched only, some say, by their diminishing impact. ?You can still expect to see certain celebrities in the front row,? said Tommy Hilfiger, who began trumpeting his alignment with entertainment world players as far back as the 1980s. But these days, Mr. Hilfiger suggested, designers and major Seventh Avenue brands need to rethink their marketing strategies. In itself, he said, ?a star?s presence does nothing to move the needle. ? That realization, somewhat slow to dawn in fashion circles, accounts in part for a perceptible drop in celebrity attendance. ?In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the shows were really ? said Billy Farrell, who heads BFA, an events photography agency. ?As a house photographer, I used to get a long list of faces. Now at any given show, one or a maximum of five celebrities are guaranteed to go backstage or sit in the front row wearing the designer clothes. ? That paucity of   personalities is ascribed to a string of factors: celebrity overexposure, a generalized fashion fatigue and, chief among them, shrinking fashion budgets. ?People don?t have as much money as they used to, and they?re scared,? said Kelly Cutrone, a fashion publicist. Aware that the payoff may be negligible, many designers are reluctant to part with the thousands, or tens of thousands, of dollars in an effort to ensure the presence of, say, a Jessica Chastain, a Julianne Moore or, for that matter, a Lady Gaga, pop culture luminaries who, once they arrive, may or may not deign to speak to the press. For designers, the topic is a touchy one. Among those who declined to comment were Georgina Chapman and Keren Craig of Marchesa, Carolina Herrera, Marc Jacobs, Mr. Rodriguez, Jeremy Scott, Diane von Furstenberg, Alexander Wang and Vera Wang. But publicists and others strategizing behind the scenes were more voluble, citing, among other causes, a certain jadedness among consumers. ?People can tell it?s a paid front row,? Ms. Cutrone said. ?Does anyone really believe that Drew Barrymore and Diane Kruger are going to Seven jeans because they like Seven jeans?? More troubling, still, is the widening view that fashion itself is losing much of its vaunted cachet. ?The shows are not cool anymore,? said Teri Agins, the author of the 2014 book ?Hijacking the Runway: How Celebrities Are Stealing the Spotlight From Fashion Designers,? which chronicles the evolution of the celebrity front row. European houses may still attract stars of a certain caliber, Ms. Agins noted, some drawn by Europe?s cachet, others compelled by   cosmetic and marketing contracts. But in New York, she said, ?the novelty is gone. ? Oversaturation has played a role. In recent years, invitations were issued, vetted and approved by teams of publicists, Hollywood agents,   stylists and, as often as not, the stars themselves, many of whom are snapped each season hopscotching from show to show, their influence diluted by their ubiquity. ?We sort of cooked our golden goose,? said James LaForce, a veteran fashion publicist. ?At the end of the day, all their pictures seemed to run together. ? ?We?re at the end of that cycle now,? he added. ?It feels   something from another era. ? By most accounts, that era dawned in the early to   when the shows, once scattered in showrooms, galleries and ballrooms all over town, were brought together under the tents at Bryant Park. At the time designer front rows were judiciously seeded with ?friends of the house,? among them society figures, and the occasional television personality, Broadway ing?nue or authentic megastar. ?They were people we dressed, people I often had dinner with, people whose children we knew and sometimes dressed,? the designer Dennis Basso said. At Mr. Basso?s fashion extravaganzas over the years, Diane Sawyer might have been seen rubbing shoulders with Ivana Trump, Martha Stewart spied sitting flank to flank alongside Mary J. Blige. ?The celebrity front row was a form of preshow entertainment,? Mr. Basso recalled. It generated the kind of frisson that a parade of clothes might not in itself provide. In that seemingly innocent era, shows were   trade events, largely the province of store buyers, journalists and a smattering of   ladies who lunched. That picture altered in the   when Uma Thurman wore a   Prada dress to the Oscars. ?It was a sort of milestone,? said Simon Doonan, the creative ambassador for Barneys New York, ?a sign that it was groovy for a designer to dress a celebrity. ? So groovy, in fact, that before long the celebrity front row went from a mildly provocative attraction to fashion?s main event, transforming, as Ms. Agins writes, ?what was once a clubby ritual for fashion insiders into a multiplatform extravaganza showcased in print, on TV and everywhere on the internet. ? In those heady days, she observed, the front row itself became part of the content of fashion show. Today, some argue, that content is debased. ?What constitutes a celebrity now has changed,? said Fern Mallis, a fashion consultant and the former executive director of the Council of Fashion Designers of America. ?It?s no longer necessarily that   Hollywood diva. ? The diva, it seems, has ceded her power to models and social media megastars like Gigi Hadid, Kylie Jenner and Irina Shayk, pop idols who bring to the table a large internet following but lack the gravitas of Ms. Chastain and her rarefied peers. ?The rise of celebrity bloggers, reality stars and others who are famous simply for being famous turns a lot of people off,? said Leslie Sloane, a prominent Hollywood publicist. ?Those girls may be lovely, but they?re not fashion. ? Just as   is the tendency of those who do turn up to stay mum. Lady Gaga appeared last season at the show of Brandon Maxwell, her    posing gamely for photographers but turning away reporters. Also taking no interviews were Ms. Holmes at Zac Posen, and Zo? Kravitz and Ms. Jenner at Alexander Wang, whose show in September was one of the few that attracted marquee names like Madonna and her daughter Lourdes. That kind of drawing power does not come cheap. Hard figures are elusive, but insiders estimate that fees for attendance can range from $25, 000 to more than $100, 000. In the   practice known industrywide as    an   attraction like Angelina Jolie could command close to $1 million, Mr. Hilfiger said. Such sums, which vary according to a celebrity?s clout, are expected to cover the cost of   airfare and hotel accommodations, as well as wardrobe, hair, makeup and other amenities. They are   numbers, for sure. But just two or three years ago, they were routinely factored into many designers? marketing budgets. In distributing funds, Mr. LaForce said, ?we would game the situation. ? It was a little like a commodities market, sums parceled out ?based on who was available and who would take what,? he said, adding, ?Still, in the end we would say it was absolutely worth it. ? For some designers, it still is. ?To have celebrities appear in our clothes adds a sense of heightened reality,? said Michael Kors, whose celebrity turnout last season included Emily Blunt Cynthia Erivo, the   winning Broadway star and Sienna Miller. ?You see the clothes on the runway, then you see our clothes from the last show on the celebrities in the front row, and you get it. The message has come full circle. ? No one would argue that the fame game is entirely played out. But for some designers, attention has shifted from actors and musicians to other kinds of pop stars. ?A handful of supermodels out there have enormous social media followings, Gigi Hadid being the leader,? Mr. Hilfiger said. ?She?s the girl next door with an exotic twist. ? (Ms. Hadid?s mother is Dutch her father is Palestinian.) Mr. Hilfiger was prompt to exploit Ms. Hadid?s growing global appeal, enlisting her to walk his runway, appear in his advertising campaigns and design a capsule collection of her own. The success of those moves was measurable, he said, in 2. 2 million social media impressions, a 900 percent increase in total   over the previous year, and tens of millions in sales of the Hadid line. Plenty of people were impressed, among them designers of an altogether different ilk. ?We understand the power involved in that alignment we won?t pretend that we don?t,? said Ryan Lobo, who, with Ramon Martin, designs Tome, a collection aimed largely at a haute bohemian clientele. Mr. Lobo and Mr. Martin, however, prefer a nuanced approach that takes celebrity marketing back to its roots. At their shows they tend to seat loyalists, prominent clients like the artists Shirin Neshat and Kara Walker, alongside such    personalities as Sandra Bernhard. ?We aim to make the mix intriguing,? Mr. Lobo said, ?like a dinner party with people who don?t normally have access to each other. ? Picking up the analogy, Mr. Martin added: ?These people are our personal icons, and there will be others. You know we?re always going to add a chair to the end of the table. ?"
18435,Ben Hubbard,9/02/2017,2017,2,business,"BEIRUT, Lebanon  ?   To the overnight editor at the Arab affairs website, it looked like big news: Kuwait, apparently following the lead of President Trump, had issued a visa ban on citizens from five other predominantly Muslim countries. The editor wrote an article, and the news rocketed through cyberspace. One link caught the eye of Mr. Trump himself, who shared it on his official Facebook page with a word of praise for the reported policy: ?Smart!? But there was a problem: The Kuwait ban was from 2011, long before Mr. Trump announced a similar measure in the United States, said James Brownsell, the managing editor of The New Arab, the site that produced that article on Feb. 1. His writer did not notice that the news was years old. Many sites that often support Mr. Trump and also published the report, including Infowars. com and Russia?s Sputnik news agency, have since clarified that it was outdated and unrelated to Mr. Trump?s order. But by Tuesday night, his uncorrected posting had racked up more than 251, 000 reactions, 68, 000 shares and 15, 000 comments, many by fans who see Kuwait?s supposed decision to follow Mr. Trump as a vindication of the president?s policy. ?So you mean to tell me Muslims are banning Muslims from certain countries?? a user wrote under the name Christina Villar. ?Then we have some Americans thinking our president is heartless. No, he is smart!? The White House did not respond on Tuesday night to a request for comment on Mr. Trump?s remarks. The internet has long been home to countless sites of dubious credibility, and the Arab world is full of news sites bankrolled by private parties to promote their interests. Historically, their audiences have been limited. But in this case, false information, based on a mistake from a   news source, was trumpeted to a vast audience by an American president who is prone to exaggeration and falsehoods, whose immigration policy is under fire, and whose administration has promoted the term ?alternative facts. ? That exposure has shocked, and pleased, some who published the false information. ?It has been quite staggering,? said Dina Dabbous, the   editor in chief of Albawaba, the   website whose link Mr. Trump shared. ?We were quite satisfied, smugly, with that particular piece. ? But the site has since corrected the article on its website. The spreading of articles about the old Kuwait visa ban began last week, after Mr. Trump signed an executive order blocking citizens from seven   countries from entering the United States. As chaos spread at airports and opponents mounted legal challenges to the order, an editor working the night shift at The New Arab, a news site based in London, came across a report that Kuwait had announced a visa ban of its own on citizens from five   states. Keenly aware of the ?justifiable international public interest,? the editor quickly wrote and published an article about the Kuwaiti ban without realizing that it was based on ?a decision made in 2011,? according to a statement posted on the site on Tuesday after The New York Times inquired about the article?s origin. By the time the error was spotted and the article updated, the first, erroneous version had already spread. ?Mistakes happen and unfortunately we found ourselves in a situation where a serious mistake like this (for which the member of staff has been disciplined) went viral,? the site?s statement said. The New Arab called its mistake ?a solitary aberration from our usually excellent coverage. ? Because of a syndication agreement, the erroneous article appeared on Albawaba on the same day it was published by The New Arab. On Albawaba, the headline read, ?Kuwait issues its own   visa ban for five   countries. ? That article caught international attention, and a number of sites that often defend Mr. Trump?s policies ran their own versions of it. Breitbart News, whose former chairman, Stephen K. Bannon, is now Mr. Trump?s chief strategist, said concerns about ?radical Islamic terrorism? had prompted Kuwait to impose the ban. Infowars. com published a version that said Kuwait was worried about ?possible migration of radical Islamic terrorists. ? Sputnik, a Russian   news agency that often  spreads disinformation, said Kuwait had ?ripped a page from the playbook of U. S. President Donald Trump? with its own visa ban. But indications soon surfaced that the article was wrong. Pakistan?s ambassador to Kuwait denied that a visa ban had been placed on Pakistanis. And on Feb. 3, Kuwait said in a statement on its state news service, KUNA, that it ?categorically denied? that it had stopped issuing visas for some nationalities. By the time some of the sites that had published the erroneous information issued clarifications, noting the Kuwaiti denial, the articles on The New Arab and Albawaba topped the ?most popular? lists on their sites, even though the articles were six days old. Mr. Brownsell, of The New Arab, said his site?s article had generated more traffic than most of its articles, although he declined to give numbers. ?It is safe to say more than usual,? he said. Albawaba issued a statement, also after an inquiry from The Times, saying its article had highlighted how hard it is for people from Syria and other countries to obtain visas to Kuwait, even if there is no official blanket ban. ?President Trump, you?re not wrong here!? the statement from Albawaba said. ?Our only fault was to call it a visa ban when it should behoove us to call it extreme vetting, or maybe even a ban with few exceptions. ? Ms. Dabbous, the editor at Albawaba, said in a phone interview on Tuesday that the article had served the site?s goal of airing ?some of the truths about the Middle East that are narratives that you don?t often see. ? She was unconcerned that her site had kept the erroneous article shared by Mr. Trump up for six days. ?With this one, we didn?t consider it all that wrong because we just think it exposes other truths,? she said."
17638,Greg Howard,15/01/2017,2017,1,business,"?The best people. ? This refrain rang throughout Donald Trump?s presidential campaign at times, it seemed to be his justification for being in the race at all. He wasn?t a politician  ?   he was a businessman. He had never run a government, but he ran a company, and running a company is, at bottom, easy: You get the best people. The pitch worked, and Trump will be sworn in as the 45th president of the United States of America. In the meantime, he has been stocking his cabinet with what he promises are the best people. Even without thinking too hard about what ?best? means  ?   best for whom? to do what?  ?   it?s still instructive to see who made the cut. The two people who will be perched on Trump?s shoulders, his chief of staff Reince Priebus and his chief strategist Steve Bannon, are white men. The top layer of his cabinet  ?   the attorney general, as well as the secretaries of state, Treasury and defense  ?   is made up of white men. In fact, if you print out a chart with the faces of Trump?s picks on it, the first thing you?re likely to notice about it is that his cabinet consists almost entirely of white men. And the second thing you?re likely to notice is Dr. Ben Carson. His is a conspicuous face. It?s black, for one, which makes it, in this cabinet, unique. It?s also famous: Carson is one of the   medical doctors of our time and mounted a presidential run of his own. But Carson?s face seems to be in the wrong place. The retired neurosurgeon won?t be running, say, Health and Human Services he?ll manage the Department of Housing and Urban Development. His inclusion is conspicuous for another reason too: Shortly after the election, Carson?s friend and adviser Armstrong Williams said that Carson wouldn?t take a cabinet position, because he had no governing experience. ?The last thing he would want to do,? Williams said, ?was take a position that could cripple the presidency. ? It seems very unlikely that a retired neurosurgeon with no governing experience is one of ?the best people? to handle city planning and housing policies. So why is he there? Carson certainly looks like what people might call a token: Someone admitted into a space dominated by one group mostly to feign inclusivity toward others. It feels unkind to actually call him that: It?s rude, messy and dismissive of Carson?s agency and ability. Still, this administration stands to be mighty white and male, and its few women and people of color, tend to appear in roles that feel like afterthoughts or stereotypes. It?s almost funny in its clumsiness. Nikki Haley, who has virtually no   experience but is the child of Indian immigrants, will be ambassador to the United Nations. A black man will oversee housing projects. As of late December, Politico was reporting that Trump?s staff was ?scrambling? to find a Hispanic candidate to head the Department of Agriculture. These appointees may be as accomplished and well qualified as anyone else in Trump?s cabinet. But the stagecraft and typecasting of their appointments are definitely what you might call tokenism, writ large and on full, public display. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy signed Executive Order 10925, which expanded on President Franklin D. Roosevelt?s order, signed 20 years earlier, which banned racial discrimination in the federal government and defense industries. Kennedy ordered that government contractors ?take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color or national origin. ? Three years later, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 extended that action to women. The Civil Rights Act of 1968 banned housing discrimination. By the decade?s end there was, at least in theory, a commitment to include everyone in American life  ?   an admission that per federal law, if only per federal law, women and brown people were full citizens. One response was violence. Where violence was ineffective or unacceptable, other forms of resistance had to suffice. Schools integrated spasmodically, often kicking and screaming in court. Workplaces often didn?t. Many white homeowners and landlords refused to sell or rent to families of color. In 1973 in New York, President Richard Nixon?s Department of Justice sued Donald Trump and his father for refusing to rent to black people. That the Trumps objected and denied this reflected not just their legal situation but a growing social consensus that things like naked racism and sexism were untoward  ?   things few people wanted to be accused of or forced to defend. But institutions throughout the nation also found it difficult to stop doing them. This is the world that brought us modern American tokenism, both as a word and as a practice. People concluded that it was easier to fake inclusion than truly include women and people of color. The easiest course was to find one person who could serve as a   to appear in a classroom or a workplace to signal that everyone was getting a fair shot  ?   not only when that was untrue, but because it was untrue and needed hiding. Tokenism is, above all, a form of misdirection. It?s the smiling Muslim kid on the school brochure, the black editorial assistant in the   newsroom, the telegenic woman serving as a campaign spokeswoman. By the   television and film had mastered this, too, dutifully checking off boxes with actors of color whose purpose was mainly to be seen. These were minor, disposable mascots who played to stereotypes, provided shallow comic relief or merely died first to show that others were in danger  ?   the obnoxious gay best friend, the asexual Asian bookworm, the West Indian nanny. This type of character became such an established trope that the adult cartoon ?South Park? featured an   child actually named Token. At tokenism?s cheapest and laziest, a mascot isn?t even necessary. People counter accusations of racism by pointing to their close but unidentified black friends. One October Trump rally featured a prominent ?Blacks for Trump? sign that was held up by an elderly white woman. In politics, complaints about tokenism come from both sides. Those on the left accuse the right of using   tokens to create the false impression of a diverse, dynamic movement that both values and is supported by women and people of color. Those on the right accuse the left of valuing diversity over quality, ticking off racial boxes instead of insisting on merit. The defining difference between these analyses is obvious. In one, the suggestion is that people other than white men are qualified to do important jobs and too seldom get the chance in the other, the suggestion is that they often lack merit but are rewarded anyway. Last month on the Fox News program ?Hannity,? the Trump adviser Newt Gingrich hailed what he saw as Trump?s dedication to the quality of cabinet appointments over arbitrary diversity. ?This is what leads him to Jim Mattis,? Gingrich said. ?This is what leads him to Rick Perry. I mean, he?s going to look for the best to come in. It?s a piece of what Trumpism is, as opposed to liberalism, which would look for the right token, surrogate, even if they were incompetent. ? But just one week later, Gingrich changed his tune. ?There has to be more Hispanics in the administration,? he told Politico, which later reported that Trump?s search to fill that Department of Agriculture slot was extending even to people who were ?  and have no experience in agriculture. ? Many white kids grow up learning that they can be anything: an astronaut, an inventor, the president. Many minorities of a certain age and place, kids who grew up before the possibility of a black president, were bused up Route 295 to Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore on   field trips, treated to speeches by a renowned neurosurgeon and taught that if they went to class, kept their heads in books and got good grades, they, too, could one day be like Ben Carson. I was one of those kids. This winter, while home for the holidays, I searched for his autobiography ?Gifted Hands,? and found it resting on a shelf in my childhood bedroom ?The Big Picture,? another of his books, was propped next to it, with my little brother?s name scrawled inside. A unique sort of sadness stirs within me when I watch Carson now. He is, in many ways, the best of us. Yet in the end, he?s just a tool for someone else. I recognize myself in him. My scholastic, athletic and professional careers have always taken me through   spaces in which I?m often alone and often the first. I?ve been called a token more times than I can count I?ve been one more times than I cared to. A token is always chosen, and there is a steady, throbbing angst that comes with being chosen over and over again, always knowing that, on some level, my abilities may be ancillary to my appearance. How do you know when you?re being used as an excuse? How can you tell the difference between a new employer who is making earnest steps toward diversity and one who is just trying to cover himself? What about the times when you know it?s the latter but want the spot, or need it, or tell yourself that being successful in it will crack the door wider for the next person? How do you prove that you belong? Can you?"
18262,Jacey Fortin,7/02/2017,2017,2,lifestyle,"What does it mean to ?dress like a woman?? Social media users took it upon themselves to answer that very question in response to a report that President Trump wants women who work for him to look a certain way. The sentiment was anonymously cited in the new newsletter Axios from Mike Allen, a former Politico reporter. In response, Twitter erupted with a stream of photos showing women dressed for the jobs they hold and the lives they lead, as firefighters, soldiers, police officers and astronauts, to name a few. But while many of the tweets were aimed at rejecting the idea that women should be restricted to some narrow sartorial category, the ?dress like a woman? phrase,   as a hashtag, didn?t come directly from Mr. Trump. In his newsletter, Mr. Allen attributed the phrase this way: In an email on Friday afternoon, Mr. Allen declined to offer any further details. It?s clear that appearances matter to the president. Mr. Trump, the former owner of the Miss Universe Organization, has come under harsh criticism for rating women?s appearances on a scale of one to 10 and for hurling insults at female critics. As a candidate, he readily attacked when people commented on the size of his hands or on his hair. Like presidents past, Mr. Trump will most likely have some influence over style in the West Wing. The White House does not have an official dress code, according to its Press Office, but every administration has its own norms. For the past two decades, wardrobes have tended to be more relaxed in Democratic administrations. Under President Clinton, ?aides frequently attended meetings in jeans and ? The New York Times reported in 2001. President George W. Bush restored formality to the West Wing, but President Obama was so relaxed that he broke with protocol, foregoing a suit jacket on his first full day in the Oval Office. If the pattern holds, dressing for work in the West Wing could become more formal under the Trump administration. Whether that means women would be required to ?dress like women? remains to be seen."
17431,Liz Alderman,7/01/2017,2017,1,science,"A controversial experiment with a   workday in one of Sweden?s largest cities wrapped up this week with a cheerful conclusion: Shorter working hours make for happier, healthier and more productive employees. There?s just one catch. The practice is too expensive and unwieldy to become widespread in Sweden anytime soon. The   trial, which took place in the southern city of Gothenburg, centered on a municipal retirement home where workers were switched to a   day, from eight hours, with no pay cut. Seventeen new nursing positions were created to make up for the loss of time, at a cost of around 700, 000 euros, or $738, 000, a year. Although it was small, the experiment stoked a widespread discussion about the future of work, namely whether investing in a better   balance for employees, and treating workers well rather than squeezing them, benefits the bottom line for companies and economies. ?The trial showed that there are many benefits of a shorter working day,? said Daniel Bernmar, the leader of the Left party on Gothenburg?s City Council, which had pushed for the experiment. ?They include healthier staff, a better work environment and lower unemployment. ? But the high price tag, and political skepticism about the practicality of a shorter workday, was likely to discourage widespread support for taking the concept nationwide. ?The government is avoiding talking about the issue,? Mr. Bernmar said. ?They?re not interested in looking at the bigger picture. ? While a growing number of countries and companies are studying the concept of employee happiness, the idea of improving it through shorter work hours has by no means gained broad traction. In Gothenburg, the City Council?s conservative opposition parties derided the experiment as a utopian folly and sought to kill it, citing high costs for taxpayers and arguments that the government should not intrude in the workplace. The current government is also not backing a shorter workweek. Even the handful of progressive political groups aligned with Mr. Bernmar?s Left party have not made a   workday in Sweden a priority in their platforms. Nor have large Swedish companies, including multinationals active around the world, embraced the idea. Other Swedish towns that previously conducted limited experiments with a shorter   workweek eventually abandoned the concept, citing high costs and flawed implementation. A similar model in France has been controversial for more than 15 years, ever since a Socialist government made a   workweek mandatory. Fran?ois Fillon, a conservative politician who is considered the   to become France?s new president in elections this May, has vowed to kill it if he wins. Companies of all sizes in France have complained repeatedly that the short workweek requirement has damaged competitiveness and generated billions in additional costs. French unions defend the measure as protecting workers from employers who might otherwise return to more onerous workplace conditions. Still, some large companies are beginning to explore the argument that happy workers may make better, more productive employees. Amazon, Google and Deloitte recently began experiments to compress the   week into four days for some employees. Amazon, which has come under fire for encouraging employees to work long hours, announced last summer that it would test a   workweek for a small group of employees and managers, giving them 75 percent of their current pay but leaving them with the same benefits as other workers. In the experiment at the Gothenburg retirement home, employees reported working with greater efficiency and energy when their hours were cut to six from eight a day. They called in sick 15 percent less than before and perceived their health to have improved at least 20 percent, according to a preliminary review issued last year. At a nearby municipal retirement home, where a control trial left working conditions unchanged, employees reported increased blood pressure and said they perceived no improvement in their health, peace of mind or alertness, the review showed. A final report is scheduled to be released in March. The program increased Gothenburg?s costs by 22 percent, mostly to pay for new employees. But around 10 percent was offset by reduced costs to the state from people being taken off the unemployment rolls and paying taxes into the system, rather than receiving state subsidies, Mr. Bernmar said. Modest experiments are moving ahead in a handful of small towns in Sweden, mostly in the public health care sector, to see if the results from Gothenburg can be duplicated. This year, four additional Swedish municipalities are expected to start research programs. A small but growing number of private Swedish companies, mainly technology   are also dabbling with the concept, following the lead of some established companies, including a Toyota service center in Gothenburg that has successfully operated on a   day for more than a decade. The bigger issue, Mr. Bernmar argues, is whether policy makers are willing to explore a connection between human happiness and health and productivity. Despite arguments that governments have no business in setting happiness as a public policy goal, leaders in several countries, including Italy, Japan and Qatar, are increasingly paying attention to the concept. The question, Mr. Bernmar added, was ?should we work to live, not live to work??"
17883,Robert Pear,25/01/2017,2017,1,business,"WASHINGTON  ?   Several Republican senators on Monday proposed a partial replacement for the Affordable Care Act that would allow states to continue operating under the law if they choose, a proposal meant to appeal to critics and supporters of former President Barack Obama?s signature health law. But the plan was attacked by Democrats as a step back from the Affordable Care Act?s protections, and it was unlikely to win acceptance from conservative Republicans who want to get rid of the law and its tax increases as soon as possible. If anything, the proposal  ?   by Senators Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a medical doctor, and Susan Collins of Maine, a moderate Republican  ?   may show how difficult it will be for Republicans to enact a replacement for the Affordable Care Act. Legislation that can pass muster in the more conservative House may not win enough support in the Senate. A bill with broad appeal in the Senate may fail in the House. Under the proposal, states could stay with the Affordable Care Act, or they could receive a similar amount of federal money, which consumers could use to pay for medical care and health insurance. ?We are moving the locus of repeal to state government,? Mr. Cassidy said. ?States should have the right to choose. ? The proposal shares some features with House Republican proposals: It would encourage greater use of health savings accounts and eliminate the requirement for most Americans to have insurance or pay a tax penalty. But the option for states to keep the Affordable Care Act alive will rankle the most conservative Republicans who have been trying for nearly seven years to blow it up. ?Obamacare is flawed, failing and not fixable, and it needs to be fully repealed,? said Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus. A stalemate between the House and Senate would leave in place Mr. Obama?s health law, but efforts by President Trump and Congress to undermine it could send health insurance markets into a tailspin. On Friday, as one of his first official acts as president, Mr. Trump signed an executive order that could allow officials to ease up on enforcement of the mandate requiring most Americans to have insurance. Supporters of the Affordable Care Act panned the   proposal. ?Millions of Americans would be kicked off their plans,    costs and deductibles for consumers would skyrocket, and protections for people with   conditions, such as cancer, would be gutted,? said the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York. Ronald F. Pollack, the executive director of Families USA, a   consumer group, said the bill ?falls way short of providing the protections and coverage people have under the Affordable Care Act. ? Ms. Collins said the bill would allow states to ?keep the Affordable Care Act if it is working for their residents. ? But she predicted that most states would choose something different. Under the   bill, states could enroll people who would otherwise be uninsured in health plans providing basic coverage. These   health plans are intended to protect consumers against catastrophic medical expenses. They would cover generic versions of prescription drugs, and they would also have to cover recommended childhood immunizations without  . States would contract with one or more insurers to offer this coverage. Consumers could buy ?more robust coverage? if they want, Mr. Cassidy said, but they could be automatically enrolled, by default, in the   health plans providing basic coverage. ?A state could say, ?All those eligible are enrolled unless they choose not to be,?? he explained. This ?passive enrollment? would provide insurers with a large pool of customers, including many healthy people, without the coercion of an ?individual mandate,? Mr. Cassidy said. ?We think that we could cover more people than Obamacare,? Mr. Cassidy said, although he acknowledged that the effects of his bill had not been analyzed by the Congressional Budget Office, which serves as Capitol Hill?s official scorekeeper. If a state opts out of the Affordable Care Act, many of the federal insurance standards established under the law would no longer apply. The bill would repeal federal benefit mandates that ?often force Americans to pay for coverage they don?t need and can?t afford,? Mr. Cassidy said. But some protections would remain in place. Parents would still be allowed to keep children on their insurance until the age of 26, and insurers could not impose annual or lifetime limits on benefits. The   bill, called the Patient Freedom Act, would eliminate not only the unpopular individual mandate, but also the federal requirement for larger employers to offer coverage to   employees. Mr. Cassidy said that Senators Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Johnny Isakson of Georgia, both Republicans, were also sponsors of the bill. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, and the No. 2 Senate Republican, John Cornyn of Texas, were sponsors of a similar bill that Mr. Cassidy introduced in 2015. But the legislative landscape is different now. Republicans in Congress can repeal the Affordable Care Act, with support from Mr. Trump. In the Senate, they will need help from Democrats to adopt a replacement because Republicans are eight votes shy of the 60 needed to stop a filibuster."
18412,Rebecca R. Ruiz,8/02/2017,2017,2,sports,"Many of the world?s winter athletes, now preparing for the season?s championship events, are frustrated with the response of sports officials to the Russian doping scandal and are wondering why implicated Russian Olympians still turn up at the starting line. Hundreds of athletes from dozens of nations have signed petitions, threatened to boycott major events and called for sports authorities to act on evidence that the urine samples of dozens of Russian athletes were tampered with to conceal widespread doping at the last Winter Olympics, in Sochi, Russia, in 2014. Russian athletes implicated in the Sochi cheating have continued to compete, and none have been disqualified by the International Olympic Committee, as officials continue further inquiries of their own. ?We will not sacrifice a full and thorough investigation that will be legally scrutinized simply to speed up the process,? Mark Adams, a spokesman for the Olympic committee, said Tuesday. Revelations of Russia?s doping schemes have compelled Olympic officials to expand their retesting of summer Olympians  ?   which have so far resulted in sanctions against dozens of athletes  ?   but their scrutiny has not affected many winter athletes so far. The Association of International Olympic Winter Sports Federations cited four major competitions that had been moved out of Russia for the   season after an outcry from athletes, including the   skiing World Cup finals and the bobsled and skeleton world championships. Accused Russian athletes have continued to participate in those competitions, the winter sports organization said, because of ?the presumption of innocence, the right to be heard and due process. ? Responding to a petition signed by more than 150 athletes, global officials for biathlon will meet in Austria on Wednesday, ahead of that sport?s world championships, to discuss the doping scandal and broader disciplinary policy. Prominent athletes, including the French biathlon champion Martin Fourcade, a winner of two gold medals at Sochi, had threatened to skip the competition unless officials addressed their concerns. The athletes have called for stricter penalties for drug violations  ?   including longer bans of up to eight years and higher fines of up to 1 million euros  ?   while also asking that officials, in scrutinizing the accused Russian athletes, balance thoroughness with speed in order to preserve the integrity of this year?s competitions. ?Given the unprecedented and urgent nature of the current situation,? the athletes wrote, ?we do not have time to wait? until 2018, when biathlon?s full leadership is next due to convene formally. The biathlon officials are also expected to vote this week on moving the 2021 world championships out of Russia. The competition was assigned to the nation in the fall, after the International Olympic Committee had expressly directed sports officials not to award new events to Russia in light of the doping scandal. Should the biathlon officials decline to move the event, the World   Agency could impose a penalty, possibly threatening the sport?s place at the 2018 Winter Olympics, in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Russia?s national team itself could face disciplinary action ahead of the 2018 Games, something some antidoping officials have called a parallel punishment for systemic cheating at the last Winter Olympics. As Olympic officials review the evidence delivered late last year by the World   Agency and an independent investigator, the Canadian lawyer Richard H. McLaren, they are considering not just the individual cases across sports but what collective punishment may be warranted in light of the Russian government?s involvement. Much of Mr. McLaren?s evidence was made public on a website, with individual names redacted. The identities of the implicated athletes were shared privately with sports officials, although some sports organizations have called the evidence insufficient. ?In some cases, provisional suspensions have had to be lifted and procedures dropped due to a lack of evidence currently provided by WADA to issue sanctions able to stand up to legal challenge,? the winter sports organization said in a statement. WADA, the antidoping regulator, is scheduled to meet with the winter sports organizations this month to discuss the evidence. Meanwhile, athletes are considering the implications of sanctions. Katie Uhlaender, an American skeleton racer who placed fourth in Sochi, has wondered for months if she will inherit an Olympic medal, after learning that the Russian athlete who placed third in that competition, Elena Nikitina, was among those whose urine sample was manipulated. Uhlaender has faced Nikitina in competition several times in the last month alone, after bobsled and skeleton officials lifted a provisional suspension on implicated Russian athletes. Investigations into those cases are continuing, those officials said. ?The I. O. C. needs to step up,? Uhlaender said. ?The McLaren report seems very clear: There was tampering. All I?m asking for is an even playing field. If you let someone get away with something, why wouldn?t they just continue doing it? Why wouldn?t others do it?? Few Olympic sports have taken such strong action on the issue as track and field, which voted unanimously Monday to keep the ban on Russia in place until the nation demonstrated change and fulfilled specific conditions."

That?s up for discussion. Just days before Donald J. Trump?s inauguration, world leaders on three continents are on edge after comments the   made in an interview on Friday with The Wall Street Journal and in a weekend interview with two European newspapers, Bild and The Times of London. ?It?s obsolete, first because it was designed many, many years ago,? Mr. Trump said, according to the German newspaper Bild. The   alliance, born in 1949, three years after Mr. Trump, is viewed by many  ?   including his nominee for defense secretary, Gen. James N. Mattis  ?   as essential to American security. ?Secondly, countries aren?t paying what they should? and NATO ?didn?t deal with terrorism. ? Responding on Monday to Mr. Trump?s comments, Dalia Grybauskaite, the president of Lithuania, which gained its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 and joined NATO in 2004, urged Mr. Trump to continue meeting the United States? financial obligations toward the alliance. Mr. Trump also criticized the European Union, describing it as ?basically a vehicle for Germany. ? He praised Britain for its vote to leave the bloc, known as Brexit, adding: ?I believe others will leave. I do think keeping it together is not going to be as easy as a lot of people think. ? French leaders also bristled at Mr. Trump?s swipe against the bloc. Their response comes as they deal with growing domestic support for the   Union and   party National Front, led by Marine Le Pen, who was spotted on Thursday at Trump Tower in New York. ?The best response,? said the French foreign minister,   Ayrault, ?is European unity. ? In the interview with The Journal, Mr. Trump said the One China policy was up for negotiation. Beijing responded quickly and decisively. Its Foreign Ministry called the policy, which recognizes Beijing as the sole Chinese government, the foundation of   States ties, and it said it was nonnegotiable. People?s Daily, the mouthpiece of the governing Communist Party, said Mr. Trump ?has been stunningly confident in his ostensible knowledge of the job, though he speaks like a rookie. ? An unusually strongly worded editorial in the   China Daily said on Monday that Mr. Trump was ?playing with fire with his Taiwan game. ? ?If Trump is determined to use this gambit on taking office, a period of fierce, damaging interactions will be unavoidable, as Beijing will have no choice but to take off the gloves,? the newspaper said. A spokeswoman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs warned Mr. Trump on Monday that any effort to undermine the policy could backfire. Mr. Trump also took aim at German automakers, warning of a 35 percent tariff on any cars they build in Mexico and export to the United States. Shares of BMW, Volkswagen and Daimler fell on Monday after his comments, but BMW said the company would stick to its plans to open a plant in Mexico in 2019. ?It?s very clear that we have to be prepared to immediately be able to neutralize the impact of a measure of that nature,? Ildefonso Guajardo Villarreal, Mexico?s economy minister, said on Friday on a Mexican news show. ?It would be a problem for the entire world,? Mr. Guajardo Villarreal warned. Such a tariff ?will have a wave of impacts that can take us into a global recession,? he said. Not surprisingly, Russian diplomats were unperturbed by Mr. Trump?s comments on NATO. They welcomed the ?obsolete? label and were enthusiastic at his suggestion that he would consider reducing sanctions against Russia if the country agreed to reduce its nuclear arsenal. Dmitri S. Peskov, a spokesman for President Vladimir V.

The French   leader Marine Le Pen delivered a grim populist kickoff to her burgeoning presidential campaign on Sunday, warning thousands of her   supporters of ?two totalitarianisms,? globalization and Islamism, that want to ?subjugate France. ? Ms. Le Pen?s dark picture of a weakened France troubled by bureaucrats and burqas was a striking echo of themes being sounded across the Atlantic. France, a prosperous country with the world?s   economy, was depicted as a besieged wreck. In a packed hall here, she made a point, in an hourlong speech brimming with nationalist fervor, of praising President Trump and the Americans who had elected him, as her supporters shouted forcefully, ?This is our country!? Americans, she said, had ?kept faith with their national interest,? even as she promised to do the same for France, saying the French had been ?dispossessed of their patriotism. ? Whether it will sell in a country undoubtedly frightened by terrorism and weary of unemployment hovering around 10 percent is unclear, but it is certain that Ms. Le Pen?s National Front party is closer than it has ever been to gaining power in France after over 40 years of existence. Polls show that she is very likely to reach at least a second round of voting in France?s   electoral process this spring. The weekend?s campaigning in this prosperous southeastern metropolis  ?   her likely runoff opponent, Emmanuel Macron, the centrist former economy minister, also drew thousands to a rally across town on Saturday  ?   offered a taste of the fierce electoral battle to come and a rerun of some of the American election?s dynamic. The populist Ms. Le Pen, 48, offered up a forbidding dystopia in urgent need of radical upheaval, much like Mr. Trump did. The boyish Mr. Macron  ?   he is 39 and has created a nonparty political movement that has suddenly caught fire  ?   spoke of ?reconciling? France and of ?working together,? and repeatedly addressed more than 10, 000 supporters in a giant stadium as ?my friends. ? France would certainly stay in the European Union, in his view, and there would be none of Ms. Le Pen?s war on globalization. The crowd spilled onto the grounds outside the stadium, forcing many to watch Mr. Macron on huge screens. He took a backhanded slap at Mr. Trump, promising refuge in enlightened France to American scientists, academics and companies ?fighting obscurantism? at home. They would have, ?as of next May,? the date of the presidential runoff, ?a homeland, and that will be France,? Mr. Macron promised. The candidates both present themselves as outsiders  ?   Mr. Macron served in the Socialist government but is not a Socialist, while Ms. Le Pen?s party has never held power  ?   but the crowds at the two rallies were a study in contrast. Judging by a   interviews, Mr. Macron?s group was peppered with teachers, doctors, academics, civil servants and men who described themselves as ?heads of companies. ? In contrast, Ms. Le Pen?s crowd was full of factory workers and former soldiers, and it adored her thundering opening line: ?I?m against the Right of money, and the Left of money. I?m the candidate of the people!? Still, the slickly produced   National Front event at Lyon?s modernist conference center, full of party functionaries in blazers scurrying about, showed how far the party has come from its disreputable ragtag origins in the early 1970s, when it emerged as a xenophobic coalition of former Nazi collaborators and disgruntled veterans of the Algerian war who had not forgiven the country?s leaders for having agreed to Algeria?s independence  ?   like Ms. Le Pen?s father, the party?s founder,   Le Pen. She has effectively kicked him out of the party. But Ms. Le Pen?s populist tirade echoed with many of the former patriarch?s themes. She delivered her speech against a screen projecting the words ?In the Name of the People,? and it was full of immigrants committing crimes, jihadists plotting attacks and European Union bureaucrats stealing jobs from the French. Ms. Le Pen promised to crack down on all of them. Clearly buoyed by Mr. Trump?s victory after years of electoral defeats in France  ?   ?The impossible becomes the possible,? Ms. Le Pen said of it  ?   she offered a sketch of what her presidency might look like. She promised to hold a referendum within six months on European Union membership, which she called a ?nightmare,? secure the country?s borders and pull France out of NATO. Foreigners, she said, were eating up France?s social benefits and offering little in return. ?Our benefits are distributed to people all over the world,? she said. But in contrast to Mr. Trump, for Ms. Le Pen restoring what she called ?sovereignty? to France appeared as an end in itself. She offered no return to a golden age of prosperity for her country, promising instead to ?restore order? within five years. Ruin was just around the corner, in her telling. ?After decades of cowardice and   our choice is a choice of civilization,? she said. ?Will our children live in a country that is still French and democratic?? The crowd ate it up. ?She?s got a real program, in the name of the people, for the workers, and by the workers,? said Eric Fusis, a    retired military officer from the Doubs. ?It?s for the nation, and not for the financial sector and the banks,? he said."
18351,Rachel Donadio and Liam Stack,7/02/2017,2017,2,politics,"PARIS  ?   First it was the Netherlands. After President Trump vowed to put ?American first,? a Dutch television show made a satirical case for why the president should consider its country second. Now, the race for   has spread. Belgium, Germany, Denmark, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Portugal and Switzerland have all joined in with videos that capture the president?s trademark bombast, demonstrating a rare case of European unity through satire  ?   and  . In the Dutch video, a     runs through a list of the country?s hallmarks and traditions that may pique Mr. Trump?s interest: the language, the tax code, the windmills and Black Pete, a contentious Christmas tradition in which Dutch people wear blackface. (?It?s the most offensive, the most racist thing you?ve ever seen,? the voice says. It adds: ?You?ll love it. It?s great. ?) Arjen Lubach, a Dutch   host whose show, ?Zondag met Lubach? (?Sunday With Lubach?) made the video that started the trend, said, ?Because we realize it?s better for us to get along, we decided to introduce our tiny country to him in a way that will probably appeal to him the most. ? The     on this video belongs to a   American comedian named Greg Shapiro. ?I?ve been working on the imitation for a while,? Mr. Shapiro said in a phone interview on Sunday from Paris. All it takes, he said, is repeating Mr. Trump?s interviews or tweets verbatim. ?There?s hardly any heightening necessary,? he said. After the video went viral, Mr. Shapiro said, ?it was nice having family from America send me these clips saying, ?Oh, this is like Dutch and Trump.? And I?d say, ?Yeah, that?s my voice.? My mom did recognize it. ? Mr. Shapiro, 48, has seen a bump on his YouTube channel, where he offers lessons in Trump impressions on his ?United States of Europe? show and posted a spoof news conference on Monday, in which he impersonates the president. Germany?s video pleads its case  ?   and expresses indignation that the Netherlands beat it to the idea. Its video lists Oktoberfest, the country?s experience with walls and Hitler, who, the video notes, ?made Germany great again. ? ?Germany wants to be second,? Jan B?hmermann, host of the talk show ?Neo Magazin Royale,? said in the video. ?Because we are strong, we are big, and who  ?   if not us  ?   deserves a third chance?? (Last year, Mr. B?hmermann?s satire of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan caused an international incident.) What did the Swiss think Mr. Trump would like about their country? The video championed the nation?s mountains (it?s not flat like the Netherlands) its nonmembership in the European Union and its cleanliness. It also said Mr. Trump, who was caught on video boasting about sexual assault, might appreciate the country?s history on women?s rights. ?We also love to treat our women badly,? the Trump impersonator in its video said. ?Love it. We didn?t let them vote until 1971. In some places, even until 1990. ? It added: ?You love gold? We love gold. During World War II, the Jews gave it to us for safekeeping. They never returned  ?   so strange  ?   so we melted it, like fondue, our national dish. ? Portugal?s video noted that Portuguese has an untranslatable word, ?saudade,? a combination of longing and nostalgia. ?We can assure you that ?saudade? is something that billions of people are feeling right now about Barack Obama. ? It also jokes that its prime minister, Antnio Costa, like Mr. Trump, came to power without winning the popular vote. ?If you have any problems with Putin  ?   which you will  ?   immediately call Antnio Costa,? it said. Belgium extended an olive branch to Mr. Trump in its video, agreeing with his comments last March that its capital, Brussels, was a ?hellhole,? but urging him to check out the   north of the country. (It dismissed the French speaking south as ?the Mexicans of Belgium? and told him to steer clear.) Denmark?s video, broadcast by the talk show ?Natholdet? (?The Nightshift?) explained the difference between Danes and danishes, and cited Hans Christian Andersen, creator of beloved fairy tales, as a point in the country?s favor. ?You have the Statue of Liberty, we have the Little Mermaid,? the video?s Trump impersonator said. ?But don?t let the name fool you, O. K.? The Little Mermaid is actually pretty huge. ? In its video, Luxembourg boasted, ?We have money, a lot of money,? adding: ?And you know what, Mr. President? You don?t even have to pay taxes. None. Zero. Nada. Promise. ? Lithuania, a small Baltic country and NATO member that has been rattled by Mr. Trump?s fondness for Russia, attempted to win him over with its fast internet speed. ?Just imagine how fast you can tweet when you have the fastest internet?? The video added that the Lithuanian president is a woman. ?She probably rigged the election,? the   said."
17884,Matt Flegenheimer,24/01/2017,2017,1,business,"WASHINGTON  ?   President Trump?s cabinet continued to take shape on Monday, as Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas earned approval to lead the Central Intelligence Agency and Rex W. Tillerson, the secretary of state nominee, cleared a key Senate hurdle to all but assure his own confirmation. Despite some shaky appearances from his nominees on Capitol Hill and often blistering Democratic opposition, Mr. Trump has thus far faced few meaningful obstacles in installing the team of his choice  ?   aided by Senate Republicans who are eager to expedite the confirmation process. Mr. Tillerson had been the only nominee to attract notable doubts from within the Republican Senate majority, briefly imperiling his prospects amid concerns over his ties to Russia and its president, Vladimir V. Putin, during Mr. Tillerson?s tenure at Exxon Mobil. But on Monday, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who had emerged as a critical vote on Mr. Tillerson?s fate, announced his support. Mr. Rubio had sharply questioned Mr. Tillerson at a hearing this month, chastising him in a series of interrogations over Mr. Tillerson?s equivocating testimony on human rights issues. Mr. Rubio also had left open the possibility of opposing him on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where Republicans hold a   majority. But in a statement posted to Facebook on Monday morning, Mr. Rubio said that despite his ?reservations? about the pick, the president was ?entitled to significant deference when it comes to his choices for the cabinet. ? Several hours later, by a   vote of   Mr. Tillerson won the committee?s recommendation. As Mr. Rubio explained his vote to reporters after the hearing, a heckler sidled up beside him with a teasing prop: a model of a spine. Mr. Tillerson must still clear a full Senate vote in order to join the administration. Mr. Trump?s aides and Senate allies had hoped to win approval on several nominees on Inauguration Day, but only two national security posts  ?   the defense secretary, James N. Mattis, and the homeland security secretary, John F. Kelly  ?   were filled. On Monday, Mr. Pompeo joined them, with the Senate convening to approve his selection, 66 to 32, after a debate that stretched into the evening. In their bid to confirm cabinet picks quickly, Republicans have been hamstrung at times by lax preparation from Mr. Trump?s team and the sprawling financial holdings of many of his nominees, which have produced reams of ethics paperwork. Still, Democrats are powerless to stop any nominees on their own. They have sought to use the confirmation process as a showcase for what they call the extreme positions of the prospective Trump cabinet and the ethical lapses that have dogged some of his selections. ?I know why our Republican colleagues want to rush these nominees through,? said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, who has taken to calling Mr. Trump?s team a ?swamp cabinet. ? ?We?re not stalling nominations,? he added. ?This isn?t sport. This is serious stuff. ? Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, urged Democrats to stand down. ?Let?s join hands and move forward,? he said. Earlier, a group of Democratic senators formally requested a second hearing for Betsy DeVos, the nominee for education secretary, after an initial review of her ethics papers. They cited potential conflicts of interest and efforts by Republicans to limit questions at her hearing last week. Ms. DeVos struggled through the hearing before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, appearing uncertain on some basics of federal education policy. In response to the Democrats? letter, the office of Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and the committee?s chairman, said there would be no second hearing, adding that Ms. DeVos had already spent more time and answered more questions than former President Barack Obama?s nominees for education secretary had. Ms. DeVos is scheduled for a committee vote next week. Several other nominees are expected to be considered by other Senate committees this week, clearing the path for their confirmations. They include Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, Mr. Trump?s choice for attorney general Ben Carson, his pick to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development Wilbur L. Ross, the nominee for commerce secretary and Elaine Chao, the nominee for transportation secretary. Hearings are scheduled on Tuesday for Representative Tom Price of Georgia, Mr. Trump?s nominee for secretary of health and human services Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, his choice for White House budget director and Linda McMahon, Mr. Trump?s pick to lead the Small Business Administration. On Monday, the chamber?s focus was on Mr. Pompeo. Though Republicans had hoped to hold the vote just after the inauguration, some Democrats objected to what they viewed as an effort to curb debate on intelligence issues. ?We ought to have a debate in broad daylight, not when senators are trying to figure out if their tux is going to fit,? Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon said at the time. Mr. Wyden continued his push on Monday, suggesting Mr. Pompeo?s record conveyed ?enthusiasm for sweeping new surveillance programs targeting Americans,? among other concerns. But Mr. Pompeo did earn the support of some Democrats, limiting drama on the floor. The most highly anticipated vote of the day had been Mr. Rubio?s, on another Trump selection. With his explosive questioning of Mr. Tillerson at the hearing two weeks ago, the former 2016 presidential hopeful had once again seized an outsize spotlight. But Mr. Rubio also seemed to feed critics? perception of him as squishy on matters of conviction, reinforcing his history of public vacillating and backtracking. He worked on immigration reform in 2013, before distancing himself from the legislation during last year?s Republican primaries. He sold ?#NeverTrump? bumper stickers on his campaign website, before announcing his support for Mr. Trump once he dropped out. He said he would not run for   to the Senate, weeks before revealing a change of heart. ?The only thing you can consistently count on when it comes to Marco Rubio is his capacity to cave,? said Ben Domenech, publisher of The Federalist, a conservative online publication. In his statement on Facebook, Mr. Rubio concluded with a warning: ?Upcoming appointments to critical posts in the Department of State are not entitled to, and will not receive from me, the same level of deference I have given this nomination. ?"
18199,Thomas Erdbrink,3/02/2017,2017,2,crime,"TEHRAN  ?   Until two weeks ago, Iran?s clerics felt comfortable leading worshipers in a chorus of ?Death to America? while simultaneously signing a $16. 6 billion deal with Boeing. Now, that status quo seems very long ago and the establishment is treading carefully, with even most   concerned that the smallest provocation could lead to military conflict. But some question how long their caution will last in the face of a Trump administration that has brought a new level of hostility and confrontation to a relationship that under President Barack Obama had been brittle but stable. Tensions flared this week after Iran confirmed that it had conducted a missile test and the national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, warned Iran that it had been put ?on notice. ? On Thursday, Iran?s Foreign Ministry spokesman, Bahram Qassemi, gave a mild rejoinder, saying, ?It is a shame that the U. S. government, instead of thanking the Iranian nation for their continued fight against terrorism, keeps repeating unfounded claims and adopts unwise policies that are effectively helping terrorist groups. ? Mr. Flynn also made clear that the challenge to Iran extended beyond the missile test, holding Tehran responsible for an attack on a Saudi warship by Houthi rebels in Yemen, who the United States says are supported by Iran. Iran denies that, but the remark was taken as a veiled warning about Iran?s support of regional proxies like Hezbollah in Lebanon and Shiite militias in Iraq. ?The Trump administration condemns actions by Iran that undermine security, prosperity and stability throughout the Middle East and place American lives at risk,? he said. Later, President Trump posted on Twitter that ?Iran is rapidly taking over Iraq,? its neighbor, ?while the U. S. squandered three trillion dollars there. Obviously long ago. ? During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump spoke favorably of unpredictability in foreign policy, pointing to President Ronald Reagan as an example of the benefits of keeping opponents off balance. Since taking office, he has been good to his word, and Iranians have noticed. ?Trump is not predictable for Americans, not for Europeans and not for us,? said Nader Karimi Joni, a war veteran and analyst close to the government of President Hassan Rouhani. ?He and his team are not trustworthy. They will not honor any agreement. Nothing good is coming from this. ? Certainly not for Mr. Rouhani, a moderate who came to power promising to ratchet down tensions with the West, cinch a nuclear deal and get Iran?s economy moving again. Now, all those goals are in jeopardy, and Mr. Rouhani?s   this spring is far from assured. On Thursday, an aide to Iran?s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called Mr. Trump?s remarks ?hollow rants? and said that they ?would bring losses for his country?s national interest. ? The adviser, the former Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, also said that Iran would continue to test missiles. Mr. Rouhani has called Mr. Trump a political novice. But there is little doubt that the clerics have been thrown off balance. One analyst with access to government deliberations said that   in Iran were confused and did not know how to deal with the situation. Some in the establishment are opting for the same rhetoric and tactics they used under Mr. Obama, but in reality, this is uncharted territory, he said. Mr. Trump has filled his foreign policy team with advisers like Mr. Flynn and the secretary of defense, Jim Mattis, who consider Iran to be the greatest cause of instability in the Middle East, if not the world, and who think the Obama administration treated Tehran with kid gloves. When Iran test fired a missile on Sunday, it did not announce the launch on state television, something the country?s leadership usually likes to do to send a message to its adversaries. Missile tests are commonplace in Iran, but Sunday?s muted test was clearly meant to test the Trump administration?s reaction. Mr. Flynn did not elaborate what he meant by saying he was putting Iran on notice. But in Iran, many agreed that whatever it meant, it did not bode well. ?When they say we are put on notice, it means we should be very careful,? said Soroush Farhadian, a reformist journalist. ?We need  . Our military men need to be prevented from making blunders. One incident in the Persian Gulf can lead to conflict right now. ? In recent months, speedboats belonging to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps have made a practice of aggressively approaching United States naval vessels, then veering off. During the campaign, Mr. Trump vowed that if they tried that under his watch, he would ?blow them out of the water. ? There have been no reported incidents since Mr. Trump took office. Ayatollah Khamenei was uncharacteristically mute during a visit on Thursday to the martyr?s graves, usually a moment for brief remarks about current affairs. The position of Mr. Rouhani is more sensitive, as he has been promoting ties with the United States and executed the nuclear agreement, with the blessing of Ayatollah Khamenei, who also has been critical of the deal. Having tied his political future to the nuclear agreement and promised to normalize relations with the West, Mr. Rouhani is rapidly losing influence, analysts say. He now finds himself faced with an American travel ban for his citizens and an American president who thinks the nuclear pact ?is a really, really bad deal. ?   are deeply critical of Mr. Rouhani and are increasingly dismissing him as a figure of the past, the right answer in the Obama era but the wrong one now. Many expect the next president to be a far more combative figure, in the mold of the former president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. ?For this Trump, we need to talk and act tough,? said Hamidreza Taraghi, a   analyst. ?Mr. Rouhani speaks beautiful words, but they are empty. We can deal with Mr. Trump. He is a businessman, but we should not compromise. ?"
18066,Michael R. Gordon and Eric Schmitt,30/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"WASHINGTON  ?   President Trump?s executive order on immigration is straining relations with the partner the United States needs most to reclaim the Islamic State?s stronghold in Mosul: the Iraqis. Iraqi officials were taken aback by the directive, which they learned about through the American news media because they had not been consulted first. The order blocks citizens from Iraq and six other predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States for 90 days. That lumps Iraq together with Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, nations with no strategic alliance with Washington. ?The effect is that many Iraqis will feel that the United States does not want a   relationship with Iraq,? said Lukman Faily, who completed a   stint as Iraq?s ambassador to Washington in June. ?We hope it is a blip. It makes it difficult for us to decipher what President Trump is up to with regard to Iraq. ? Mr. Faily has been directly affected by the order. Though he holds dual British and Iraqi citizenship, he said information he had received from the American Embassy in Baghdad indicated that he would not be allowed to travel to the United States in the coming weeks to participate in a   conference, he said in a telephone interview from Iraq. The edict followed inflammatory comments that Mr. Trump made during a visit to the C. I. A. this month, in which he said that the United States should have ?kept? Iraq?s oil after the   invasion and might still have a chance to do so. More broadly, it clashes with a memo that Mr. Trump issued on Saturday calling on the Pentagon to submit a new plan for stepping up operations against the Islamic State, including by empowering ?coalition partners. ? With Iraq furnishing the ground forces for the coming assault on western Mosul, and with more than 5, 000 American troops in the country, the political support of Baghdad is essential. But current and former American officials are worried that the directive will have a corrosive effect on   relations at a critical stage in the fighting. ?My brothers in Iraq?s Army, who I proudly fought with, are fighting ISIS tonight,? Mark Hertling, a retired Army lieutenant general who led American forces in northern Iraq, wrote on Twitter. ?The Iraqi govt is now winning. And we ban their citizens?? The order, which administration officials said was drafted without the input of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Middle East experts at the State Department, has offended the Iraqis in several respects. During the Bush administration, the United States and Iraq signed a Strategic Framework Agreement, which calls for close diplomatic, economic and security ties and is still in effect. ?If I were an Iraqi, I would be waving this signed agreement in the face of the current administration,? said Ryan C. Crocker, who negotiated the accord and served as the United States ambassador to Iraq under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. ?It is totally inconsistent. ? Iraqis who are already skeptical about Washington have also seized on the order to stir up opposition against the United States. Moktada   the fiery cleric whom many Iraqi Shiites support, accused the United States of ?arrogance. ? ?So get out U. S. citizens from Iraq before you expel communities from U. S.,? he said on Twitter. To contain the political damage, officials said a   call between Prime Minister Haider   of Iraq and Mr. Trump might be arranged for this week. Mr. Trump spoke on Sunday with King Salman of Saudi Arabia and with the crown prince of the United Arab Emirates, but neither Saudi Arabia nor the Emirates are covered by the new order. Iraqi officials who are close to the Americans worry that the Islamic State will exploit the policy in its propaganda to recruit new volunteers. As of early Sunday, the terrorist group had made no official pronouncement. However, individual members and supporters have been sharing the order and news articles about it. Yet another worry has been expressed by veterans, and even members of Mr. Trump?s own party: that the order will interrupt the flow of former Iraqi interpreters and cultural advisers who have worked closely with the Americans and have sought special visas to move to the United States for their own protection. ?The people we need to accomplish the mission are nervous, and rightly so, that our country is going to turn our backs on them,? said Steve Miska, a retired Army colonel, who spent 40 months and three deployments in Iraq. Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Republicans who have been strongly supportive of the military, expressed concern that a strict application of the order might even block Iraqi pilots from coming to the United States for training. ?This executive order bans Iraqi pilots from coming to military bases in Arizona to fight our common enemies,? they wrote in a statement issued Sunday. The more fundamental question is whether the White House can balance the fulfillment of a campaign promise to carry out ?extreme vetting? of citizens from Muslim countries with the need to maintain strong ties with Muslim partners in its fight against the Islamic State. The air bases that the United States uses to bomb the group are all in Turkey or Arab countries, as are American troops. ?The president?s actions on refugees and immigration are certain to backfire,? said Matthew G. Olsen, a former director of the National Counterterrorism Center. ?The policies validate the terrorists? claim that we are at war with Islam, and will alienate our Middle East allies and isolate American Muslims here at home. ?"
17352,Carl Hulse,5/01/2017,2017,1,politics,"WASHINGTON  ?   Majorities in Congress often overreach, but usually not on the very first day. House Republicans, on the verge of a Washington takeover as the new Congress convened Tuesday, couldn?t stop themselves from trying to dilute the power of a despised ethics watchdog as their first order of business. In the process, they created an unsightly spectacle that pretty much ruined an   celebration of unified Republican government, undermined their own leadership and perhaps foretold the shape of things to come. House Republicans take a stand on a contentious issue, Donald J. Trump turns to Twitter to break with House Republicans, then Republicans frantically reverse course. ?Mr. Trump campaigned that he was going to drain the swamp, and here we are on Day 1 trying to fill the swamp,? Representative Walter B. Jones, Republican of North Carolina, said after he and his colleagues hurriedly jettisoned a plan seen as a brazen attempt to weaken an independent ethics office that some felt had been unfair to lawmakers. ?That is not a good way to start. ? Deluged by angry phone calls and bad headlines, chagrined Republican officials say they were well on their way to abandoning the ethics revisions adopted Monday night in a   party meeting before Mr. Trump weighed in via Twitter and suggested that the overhaul shouldn?t be a top priority, urging Republicans to focus instead on taxes and health care. But the final decision did come after the  ?s Twitter posts, underscoring his sway over House Republicans who had moved ahead despite objections and warnings about the optics of the change from Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the majority leader. House Republicans might have amusedly applauded Mr. Trump?s cutting tweets when they were aimed at the news media and other common foes, but they found them measurably less funny when the criticisms were directed their way, raising alarms among Republicans about his power to corral them via social media. Following the decision to reverse course, several lawmakers were quietly fretting that Mr. Trump?s megaphone was much more powerful than they had realized. Other Republicans both on and off Capitol Hill were wondering how the   proposal got as far as it did, given the stated reservations of Mr. Ryan and Mr. McCarthy among others. They said it did not bode well that the rank and file was so willing to ignore leadership on such a potentially critical matter, demonstrating once again how hard it can be to manage the House Republicans even when the party is set to control both Capitol Hill and the White House. Mr. Ryan had already headed off an earlier rules change that was deemed potentially embarrassing: a proposal to let lawmakers resume funding of pet projects through designated ?earmarks? as long as the money went to public entities. Abuse of earmarks was one of the main sources of congressional corruption that led to tighter ethics rules and a ban on such spending, and Mr. Ryan and his allies believed that a quick move to restore them so soon after Mr. Trump?s election would not send the proper signal. But Mr. Ryan has promised to revisit both the earmark issue and the revisions to the Office of Congressional Ethics later this year. The ethics office was created in 2008 at the urging of Representative Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat who was then the House speaker. This was in response to criticism that the Select Committee on Ethics, comprising lawmakers from both parties, was ineffective, given a string of   corruption cases and other breakdowns such as a scandal involving teenage House pages. Lawmakers from both parties were against the office then, as well as now, and would much prefer to be judged by their peers  ?   politicians currently serving in the House who might be more sympathetic  ?   as opposed to a more discrete board and staff. But in moving ahead with the rules change on a strictly partisan basis, Republicans opened the door to Democrats berating them for the proposal, even though a significant number of Democrats are just as unhappy with the ethics office. It was similar to a move House Republicans made in 2005 when they used the   rules package to weaken the ethics committee itself after a series of rebukes against Tom DeLay, the majority leader. That decision sparked an outcry from Democrats and watchdog groups that helped Democrats regain the majority the next year with a message that Republicans were fostering a culture of corruption. ?I think it is always better to do changes to the ethics process in a bipartisan manner,? said John Feehery, a former top Republican aide in the House. ?It protects you from political attacks. ? The tussle over the ethics office is just one illustration of how Mr. Trump and his outsider ideas could clash with his own party in Congress. Mr. Trump has vowed to move forward with a proposal to impose term limits on Congress, and many in the party are not happy with that idea. Other sources of friction are bound to emerge, given his campaign message about shaking up Washington. ?I just could not believe that the Congress does not understand that, if anything, we need to bring sunshine in,? Mr. Jones said. House Republicans may understand that idea a little bit better now."
18252,Anthony Tommasini,4/02/2017,2017,2,entertainment,"The Metropolitan Opera?s new production of Dvorak?s ?Rusalka? may be the unlikeliest hit of the season, a staging that takes opera?s answer to ?The Little Mermaid? fairy tale and turns it into an almost shockingly dark, sexy drama. The mysterious look of the production, fantastical and ominous, combines with the sensual singing of a handsome cast to create a romantic energy rare at the Met  ?   or at any opera house. When this project was first announced, ?Rusalka? seemed a promising match for the director Mary Zimmerman, best known for casting fairy tale magic in her Tony   ?Metamorphoses. ? But many were wary. Her three previous productions for the company, though full of ideas, were all variously disappointing. With this ?Rusalka,? though, Ms. Zimmerman comes into her own as a director at the Met. Working with the set designer Daniel Ostling, the costume designer Mara Blumenfeld and the lighting designer T. J. Gerckens, Ms. Zimmerman has explored the dark complexities of this fable. At the opening on Thursday, Mark Elder conducted a glowing account of Dvorak?s score. And the Met has assembled a matchless cast, led by the lovely soprano Kristine Opolais, who gives a vocally lustrous and achingly vulnerable performance as Rusalka, the water nymph who falls in love with a human prince. Even in the unusual love scenes between the prince and the silent Rusalka, who has given up her voice to become mortal, Ms. Zimmerman has coaxed simmering tension from Ms. Opolais and the dashing tenor Brandon Jovanovich. The director has said that this opera carries a wise warning: If you have to transform yourself drastically, to the point of literally losing your voice, for the sake of love, the relationship may well be doomed. That theme comes through in every element of this haunting production, whose intensity coexists with a sense of disorientation: Ms. Zimmerman has subtly destabilized almost every aspect of the work. The opening scene is set in a meadow by a pond, and in this staging, everything seems a little off. The pond is a forbidding pool from which mists slowly spew the willow tree on which Rusalka rests is twisted and creepy. Dancing wood sprites (including a singing trio: Hyesang Park, Megan Marino and Cassandra Zo? Velasco) prance around in curiously ornate costumes, with frilly foliage skirts and headdresses of prickly twigs. As Vodnik, the water gnome who presides over the meadow, the earthy, stentorian   Eric Owens looks endearingly foolish in a   robe and crown. When Rusalka, who is Vodnik?s daughter, starts to tell her father about her sorrows and longing, Ms. Opolais, with golden hair and a   gaze, wears an aqua gown with long, flowing trails, almost like rivulets of lake water. The cumbersome dress weighs her down: This is just one detail of many with which Ms. Zimmerman suggests that Rusalka is not just part of, but bound by, the natural world. And with her fidgety physical gestures and darting eyes, Ms. Opolais conveys the character?s restlessness and pining. This powerful singing actress adds unusual intensity to her plaintive ?Song to the Moon,? Rusalka?s famed lament, suggesting the character?s defiant side more than most sopranos. Ms. Zimmerman and her design team have mixed periods to create an atmosphere of unease. The athletic Mr. Jovanovich wears an   hunting coat, and as the witch Jezibaba, who dwells in the forest but straddles the human and supernatural worlds, the powerhouse   Jamie Barton is made up like a Victorian matron (though the cobweb patterns on her dress are a surreal touch). Rusalka goes to Jezibaba in desperation to ask for a potion that can turn her into a human. Ms. Barton?s chortling Jezibaba says she?ll help, but the witch warns Rusalka that she will become mute to all humans, including the prince. The transformation takes place atop a   surgical table, attended to by a valet and a maid who are here dressed as a giant, eerie mouse and a crow. Ms. Zimmerman presses a dark vision of the patriarchal oppression at the root of the fairy tale. At the start of their first love scene, the prince, thinking that Rusalka, now wearing a white sleeveless dress, looks vulnerable, wraps her in his cloak. When she finally succumbs to his passion, Mr. Jovanovich lifts Ms. Opolais into his arms. The staging suggests that the reborn Rusalka may not really be free, but is simply adapting to a new set of strictures. Loving the prince means submitting to him. In the prince?s castle in Act II, Ms. Opolais?s Rusalka seems like a lost waif as a strange ballroom dance takes place around her, with the courtly participants going through all manner of angular, jutting movements. (The choreographer is Austin McCormick, in his Met debut.) A rival for the prince appears, called simply the Foreign Princess in the libretto and here played formidably by the Wagnerian soprano Katarina Dalayman, who feeds the prince?s exasperation with Rusalka?s unnerving silence and oddly cold embraces. By the end of the opera, when Rusalka has fled the castle and returned to her pond, Ms. Zimmerman has turned the meadow gray and dank the set?s scaffolding is partly exposed. Or is this just the way it appears to Rusalka? Perhaps she now sees, with painful clarity, the bare beams that prop up the seemingly rich natural world. The prince has gone in search of Rusalka, and finds her: Now, finally, the two have a real love duet, impassioned, fitful music, sung here with burnished sound and wrenching beauty by Ms. Opolais and Mr. Jovanovich. But the doomed Rusalka has become a moonlit phantom, as she warns the prince. By kissing her, he dies. In a final directorial gesture, before heading alone into the forest, Rusalka puts on the prince?s coat. This time, though, it seems a token of remembrance."
