0,0,"Who is the author of the memoir ""Nicotine""?",1,17552,"The best cigarette you will ever smoke, Gregor Hens writes in his new memoir, Nicotine, is the relapse cigarette. It tastes better, he adds, the longer the prior abstinence. This is dangerous knowledge. More than a few smokers relapsed after Sept. 11. Others did after the recent presidential election, as if heeding the poet James Dickey's dictum that guilt is magical. Some of us barely keep the urge at bay. There's a dark sliver in a former smoker's mind that for dire events, so as to justify lighting up again. But it's not as if we need large cues, Mr. Hens writes, when small ones will do. Every form of cigarette ad gives me a pang of longing, every carelessly cigarette packet at a bus stop, every cigarette butt, every beautiful woman holding a cigarette between her fingers or just looking like she could be holding one, he writes. My reading chair in Columbus gives me a pang, and M. s balcony in Berlin, and my old Jeep because I've smoked some of the best cigarettes while driving. Mr. Hens is a German writer and translator who has lived and taught in the United States. Nicotine? is the first of his own books to be issued in English. It's a hybrid volume: part memoir, part philosophical lament. It doesn't always click. There are passages (?I saw myself as a part of a field of tension?) that, in this translation by Jen Calleja, veer close to psychobabble. But when Nicotine? stays dry, earthy and combustible, like a Virginia tobacco blend, it has a lot to say and says it well. The author does not resemble your idea of a former serious smoker. There Mr. Hens is, and dimpled, in his author photo on the back flap. He looks as if he were ready to bag organic carrots during his weekend stint at the food . Indeed, he writes, he is a serious cyclist, a participant in triathlons and a member of the German Alpine Association. He's been a health nut all along, at least in between long bouts of smoking. I can't decide if this is suspicious or insane, like that famous photograph of the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Len Dawson, taking a deep drag on a cigarette in the locker room during halftime of Super Bowl I in 1967. I've smoked well over a hundred thousand cigarettes in my life, and each one of those cigarettes meant something to me, Mr. Hens writes. He goes on: I've smoked cold cigarette butts, cigars, cigarillos, bidis, kreteks, spliffs and straw. I've missed flights because of cigarettes and burnt holes in trousers and car seats. I've singed my eyelashes and eyebrows, fallen asleep while smoking and dreamt of cigarettes of relapses and fires and bitter withdrawal. He sees this book as a chance finally to put the urge behind him, to comprehend it, seal it and bury it. He writes about his childhood.

1,0,"Who is the author of the memoir ""Nicotine""?",2,17552,"while smoking and dreamt of cigarettes of relapses and fires and bitter withdrawal. He sees this book as a chance finally to put the urge behind him, to comprehend it, seal it and bury it. He writes about his childhood. His father smoked so much that the author thought smoking was the older man's job. His mother, a stylish woman who drove a Range Rover, smoked more when she was depressed. There's a faded romance in the European brand names of the cigarettes he or his family members smoked: Finas Kyriazi Fr'res Kims Murattis filterless Senior Services Erntes Van Nelle Halfzwares. This book takes us to unusual and evocative locations, too, such as the Frisian island of Borkum. Mr. Hens recounts a drive to the German city of Balderschwang, which sounds like a word an American politician would utter when something livelier than poppycock? was required. He is especially good on how those who quit become vicarious smokers. Sometimes I walk around the city and imagine that others are smoking on my behalf, he writes. I silently thank the smokers in front of the cafes and office buildings and in smoking areas, imagining that they do it for me, for my inner contentment. I have people smoke for me. Like any author worth reading, Mr. Hens is sometimes best when he goes dispatching obiter dicta. He is brutal about the Midwest. (?The most insignificant city in the United States is Columbus, Ohio. ) He's interesting about aphorisms and our need to attach them, usually erroneously, to famous people. He considers how often we utter the phrase no worries? when, in fact, we are murderously aggrieved. He charts the passing of time by noting how the white tennis balls of his youth have become neon green. This book is not a deep dive into smoking and literature, or into smoking and films. He doesn't go out of his way to conjure the romance of two lit cigarettes and a corner table. Nicotine? mostly omits the social pleasures of smoking. Mr. Hens is, with a metaphorical carton of American Spirits under his arm, a smoking section of one. His lapidary prose will sometimes put you in mind of the Norwegian writer Karl Ove Knausgaard's, though Mr. Knausgaard is generally more penetrating. The small photographs in Nicotine? recall the images in some of W. G. Sebald's books. This edition of Nicotine? includes an introduction by the English writer Will Self that belongs in the hall of fame of bad introductions. Mr. Self (never has his name seemed so apt) tries to Mr. Hens by bragging at length about his own peerless nicotine addiction. This introduction is profitably torn out, the way smokers of unfiltered cigarettes tear the filters from Marlboros. This seems like the place to mention that Mr. Hens compares the cottony insides of a cigarette filter, perfectly, to artichoke hair. Someday, surely, smoking will be outlawed. Who will smoke the last unfiltered Camel? Some of us who quit years ago like",-2.276561
2,0,"Who is the author of the memoir ""Nicotine""?",3,17689,"American novelists have long complained about the ability of real life to outstrip fiction. In his landmark 1961 essay Writing American Fiction, Philip Roth observed that actuality is continually outdoing our talents, and the culture tosses up figures almost daily that are the envy of any novelist. The figure Roth cites is Charles Van Doren, of scandal fame but place Mr. Van Doren next to Donald J. Trump, and you can measure the change in the nature of credibility over the past . Mr. Van Doren was disgraced when it was revealed that he had been given the answers to the questions on the game show ? a contest that television viewers believed was real, not staged. Today an entire flourishing genre of television goes by the name reality, yet no one who watches it thinks it is genuinely real that is, unplanned and unedited. Artificiality is what makes reality television enjoyable, even though these same shows, if advertised as fiction, would appear banal, repetitive and undramatic. Reality is the ingredient that turns a bad fiction into an enthralling one. This dynamic is part of the novel's origins. The earliest English novels, from Moll Flanders? (1722) to Clarissa? (1748) were published anonymously, with titles that implied they were true stories. It took generations to establish the conventions of fiction sufficiently to allow readers to take pleasure in novels that were explicitly untrue. The suspension of disbelief that fiction involves is a late stage in the evolution of taste, and it may prove to have been a temporary one. The rise of the memoir over the past few decades doesn't mean that readers are ready to abandon the techniques of fiction but, like readers three centuries ago, they want the freedom of fiction along with consequentiality of fact. The author David Shields diagnosed this desire in his 2010 manifesto Reality Hunger?: I find it very nearly impossible to read a contemporary novel that presents itself as a novel. Many fiction writers share this intuition, though they respond to it in different ways. One way is to make the novel by turning its imitation of reality into an exaggeration, a mirror. Has our reality since felt apocalyptic? Then imagine Manhattan being destroyed by zombies (Colson Whitehead's Zone One?) or a flood (Nathaniel Rich's Odds Against Tomorrow?) or civil war and foreign bankers (Gary Shteyngart's Super Sad True Love Story?). Because we know such things could never happen, they mark the story as fiction because we know similar things have happened and will happen, they become truthful fictions. An alternative approach is to make fiction as close to fact as possible, by reducing its scope to the one subject on which each writer is an unchallengeable authority: himself or herself. Ben Lerner's 10:04, Tao Lin's Taipei? and Sheila Heti's How Should a Person Be? all seek to convince us that we are reading about the writer's actual life. These writers are engaged in a sophisticated project, in which the line between truth and",-6.1288157
3,1,What skills are inmates learning in the innovative program at Lecce Penitentiary?,1,17382,"LECCE, Italy One of his first students was a young man he had arrested four years earlier. Others have been convicted of armed robbery, drug trafficking and criminal association with the mafia. The classrooms are frugally equipped, behind windows protected by vertical and horizontal bars, although one has brightly colored paintings covering the walls. But none of that deterred Marco Albanese, a police officer for 19 years and a trained sommelier for five, from teaching a class of rapt students the finer points of deconstructing the bouquet of a chardonnay or pouring a rare vintage. Mr. Albanese, 43, is an instructor in an innovative effort at Lecce Penitentiary to teach inmates to be sommeliers, or wine stewards. The courses are part of a program to teach prisoners new professional skills, as well as to help them develop a bond with the region, which is renowned for its negroamaro grapes. The program has been enthusiastically embraced by the prisoner students, who were tasting white wines on a recent afternoon. It has also been an eye opener for Mr. Albanese. I could see their human aspect, once they were out of their context, Mr. Albanese, who traded in his police uniform for the crisp blue jacket and tie of a sommelier for the class. And I didn't have to keep the same distance, now that I was their professor. ? He added, They also deserve a second chance, and it's important that they know that the institutions do believe that they can be educated to a different life. In eight lessons, the group of 30 men and women, who are instructed in separate classes, learn how to taste, choose and serve local wines. We hope to teach them the social value of work and the preciousness of their own territory, so that they can later choose to work here, already having the right skill set, said Rita Russo, the director of Lecce Penitentiary, which is the largest in the region of Apulia. Inmates can also study for their high school diplomas, cultivate tomatoes, take theater classes and learn to be painters or tailors. Class begins with a slide show on the history of wine, explaining how it was drunk by the ancient Greeks and introducing the students to the Roman ancestors of modern sommeliers in Italy. On a school table, covered with a khaki tablecloth, stood wine glasses, ready for use. Three bottles of chardonnay, a red primitivo and a negroamaro stood on a table nearby. Mr. Albanese then addressed the prisoners, who sat facing him on stools listing the temperatures at which different wines should be served and how to store them in cellars. For a finale, he offered a tip. Do remember, even if you had Trump over for dinner, the pope would still be served first. The clergy does come first, even before heads of state, he said, to raucous laughter. The prisoners, whose identity is being protected by the prison, were not allowed to be interviewed or photographed",5.459594

The clergy does come first, even before heads of state, he said, to raucous laughter. The prisoners, whose identity is being protected by the prison, were not allowed to be interviewed or photographed for this article. Roberto Giannone, who works for the local sommelier association, then demonstrated how to open a bottle, neatly slicing off the capsule covering the bottleneck in three cuts, inserting the corkscrew and smoothly pulling out the cork. Once the cork is out, he said, use a napkin to show it to your customers. It's an easy way to be polite and avoid objections. Since the 1970s, the Italian penal system has focused on for inmates. However, a lack of funds for rehabilitation, as well as chronic overcrowding, means that thousands of incarcerated men and women have little to do all day. That has sparked some innovative rehabilitation programs, including a restaurant inside a prison near Milan in which the waiters and cooks are inmates. But the sommelier class at the Lecce prison is believed to be unique in Italy. Of course, sommelier courses can't be considered a treatment, said Georgia Zara, the head of a program at the University of Turin that offers a master's degree in criminological and forensic psychology. But they do educate inmates and create social interaction, which is very important. The classes also offer a bridge between the jail context and the world outside, so it's a small investment to reduce the risk of recidivism, Ms. Zara said. Gianvito Rizzo, 53, is the chief executive at the Feudi di Guagnano, a local vintner that provides wine, like negroamaro, for the classes. He is also the creator of the sommelier classes at the prison. Mr. Rizzo has proposed that inmates start working on his nearly 75 acres of vines in the coming year under certain circumstances, some inmates in Italy are allowed to work outside prisons. I see wine in a democratic way, Mr. Rizzo said as he walked through his vineyard recently. The countryside is the opposite to a cell. You are free. You smell nature, and learn to care for it. I think it'd be good also for inmates to try it out. Mr. Rizzo said that when he had received a master's degree from the Bocconi University business school in Milan three decades ago, he had been fixated? on doing something for his native region of Salento, in Apulia, on the heel of the Italian boot. He settled on going into the wine business, which had been struggling to convert farmers who cultivated for personal or local use into becoming larger producers. He now produces 16 different wines from grapes grown in vineyards that he and two friends and business partners inherited from their fathers, added to those that other friends asked them to cultivate on their behalf.

6,2,"Who surrendered to the authorities for changing the Hollywood sign to ""Hollyweed""?",1,17547,"A man who admitted changing the Hollywood sign to Hollyweed? has turned himself in to the authorities. Zachary Cole Fernandez, a artist, surrendered on Monday with his lawyer at his side, according to the Los Angeles Police Department. He was booked on a misdemeanor trespassing charge and released on bail. The sign was changed about 3 a. m. on Jan. 1, when two O's were partly obscured by sheets and turned into E's. It remained that way throughout the morning before the sign was restored. In a phone interview, Mr. Fernandez said he considered the results more of an art installation than a prank. Yeah, I broke the rules, but I broke it with good spirit and good intentions, he said on Tuesday. It was just to bring light and positivity and happiness. But David Ryu, a Los Angeles councilman, remained unamused. Pranks of this nature deplete the resources of our valuable public safety personnel, in both responding to the prank and in responding to the increased crowds and copycat attempts that these incidents generate, he said in a statement on Monday. My office has urged the city attorney and L. A. P. D. to investigate and prosecute this case, as well as all attempts to trespass near, alter, or vandalize the sign. Mr. Fernandez is expected to appear in court on Feb. 15. He said he had been inspired by a similar alteration in 1976, and that he had used clamps and sheets so as not to damage the sign. I don't want to destroy anything, he said. I'm about peace and love and respect and integrity and a lot of things that in some ways are missing these days. I wanted to show there's a light in the world. A father of four children ranging in age from 3 to 9, Mr. Fernandez said he had been told he could face up to six months in jail.

That opening line, as if the assembled audience needed any introduction, gave way to a giddy roar and then, one of country music's great performances. It was on this day in 1968 that Johnny Cash played his At Folsom Prison? concert. The event was meant to revive Mr. Cash's career, which had flagged since the 1950s thanks to an amphetamine habit. Executives at Mr. Cash's record label, Columbia Records, saw him as so unreliable that they kept the planning of the Folsom show a secret from the press, said Robert Hilburn, author of Johnny Cash: The Life. They weren't certain he would show. Thankfully, he did. And he was incredible. It was like he sensed this was a moment, said Mr. Hilburn, who himself attended the concert after hearing about it from a disc jockey. Mr. Cash tailored his song choices along themes of longing, sin and misfortune, including, of course, his 1955 hit Folsom Prison Blues. Assembled in the heavily guarded Dining Room 2, the inmates couldn't get enough. You could just sense their spirit rising, said Mr. Hilburn. It was just electrifying. The band actually performed twice, in the morning and afternoon, to ensure a good recording. At Folsom Prison? drew largely from the first show and was released four months later. It was a huge success and kicked off a resurgence in Mr. Cash's popularity. A year later, he did another prison record, At San Quentin, which was also successful.

The Crest archive represents a major document dump, but the C. I. A. has published many other declassified files online. Its files are typically unclassified after 25 years. For those who believe the truth is out there, the website has a collection of reports on unidentified flying objects, and capitalized on interest in last year's reboot by posting the top five documents Mulder would love to get his hands on. After journalists at MuckRock, a news site, filed Freedom of Information Act requests for access to the Crest database, the C. I. A. said in 2015 that it would take 28 years to publish. In 2015, the agency cut its estimate to six years, and said the documents would be delivered on 1, 200 compact discs at the price of $108, 000. Put off by what he perceived as stalling, Mr. Best crowdfunded $15, 000 to print, scan and publish files himself. In October, the C. I. A. said it would post the files. C. I.

Mr. Trump had bobbed and weaved his way through nearly an hour of interrogation, offering vague answers to critical questions about his administration. Yet the conduct of the news media, a familiar foil from Mr. Trump's campaign days, remained at the center of the day's story. The treatment of Mr. Acosta raised alarms among news media advocates and his fellow journalists, particularly after Mr. Acosta described a threat by Mr. Spicer to eject him from the news conference when he persisted in trying to ask the a question. Harsh words between reporters and press secretaries happen. But an anchor for a rival network, Shepard Smith of Fox News, later came to Mr. Acosta's defense, saying that no journalists should be subjected to belittling and delegitimizing by the of the United States.

When interviewed by the Senate committee, Colonel Moulton testified that he did not recall any subsequent briefings for United States Joint Forces Command on the proposal.

U. working with the Gibbons law firm of Newark, have said that they were trying to avoid asking the government to release classified information in the case, and instead were relying heavily on public records. Their strategy is to avoid demanding any information that might lead to the imposition of the state secrets privilege, which allows the government to prevent information from being made public in court cases by claiming it could damage national security. That could shut down the case. If it goes forward, a trial is expected to take place in June. In a filing in the case last week, Chad A. Readler, the acting United States assistant attorney general, and other government lawyers indicated that the government would seek to invoke the privilege to block testimony by James Cotsana, a former C.

The Justice Department requested additional time to invoke the state secrets privilege, it said, because the new C. I.

The multiple levels of review, the government added, present unique challenges in this case given the recent change of administration. Subpoenas to depose John A.

12,4,Which leader of the fringe movement embracing white nationalism was punched in the face during the protests in Washington?,1,17841,"WASHINGTON A spate of violence erupted on Friday in the nation's capital, as protesters damaged storefronts, threw rocks and bricks at police officers and lit a limousine on fire. Phalanxes of police officers used pepper spray, flash grenades and other nonlethal tools to disperse the protesters. By the end of the day, six police officers had sustained minor injuries and more than 200 people had been arrested. Many of the protesters were dressed in black, wore face masks and carried flags associated with groups. They congregated on a series of streets just blocks from the parade where Donald J. Trump passed as he made his way to the White House for the first time as president, their activities creating a distraction as television networks played live footage of the clashes. The violence was focused not only on the police. Richard B. Spencer, a leader of the a fringe movement that embraces white nationalism and a range of racist and positions, was punched in the face by a protester as Mr. Spencer gave an interview on the street, according to a video posted on Twitter. We're not peaceful, said one of the masked protesters who, like many others who clashed with the police, ran away after being approached by reporters. While the clashes occurred, thousands of peaceful protesters marched across the country as they voiced slogans. In New York, seven people were arrested when they blocked the sidewalk outside Trump Tower. Protesters in San Francisco formed a blockade across train tracks, leading to eight arrests, and chained themselves to the downtown offices of Uber and Wells Fargo. In the central business district of Portland, Ore. banks, clothing retailers and a jewelry store boarded up windows and covered walls to limit vandalism. Chants in English and Spanish broke out in front of the Capitol in Phoenix. This is one of the darkest days in the history of our country, said Adelle Wallace, 75, during a march in Los Angeles. The violence in Washington began about an hour before Mr. Trump was sworn in at noon. Storefront windows at a Bank of America and a Starbucks several blocks from the parade route were smashed, leading to many arrests. Around 2 p. m. as Mr. Trump ate lunch on Capitol Hill with lawmakers and supporters, the protests expanded and turned violent. Protesters hurled rocks and bricks at police officers several blocks from the parade route. Officers with helmets and riot shields tried to disperse the protesters by using flash grenades and pepper spray. After being pushed back a block, protesters outside the Washington Post building lit a fire in the middle of the street, smashed the windows of a limousine and then lit it on fire.

In Berkeley, Calif. on Wednesday night, masked protesters set fires, smashed windows and stormed buildings on the campus of the University of California to shut down a speech by Milo Yiannopoulos, an inflammatory Breitbart News editor and a provocateur already barred from Twitter. Five people were injured, administrators canceled the event, and the university police locked down the campus for hours. That followed a bloody melee in Seattle on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, when demonstrators their faces concealed to minimize the risk of arrest tried to prevent a speech by Mr. Yiannopoulos at the University of Washington, and a was shot and seriously wounded by a supporter of Mr. Yiannopoulos. The outbreaks of destruction and violence since Mr. Trump's inauguration have earned contempt from Republicans including Trump supporters who say it is exactly why they voted for his promises of law and order and condemnation from Democrats like Berkeley's mayor, Jesse Arregun. He called Wednesday's display contrary to progressive values? and said it provided the ultranationalist far right exactly the images they want? to try to discredit peaceful protesters of Mr. Trump's policies. But anarchists and who often make up a small but disproportionately portion of protesters, defend the mayhem they create as a necessary response to an emergency. Yes, what the black bloc did last night was destructive to property, Eric Laursen, a writer in Massachusetts who has helped publicize anarchist protests, said, using another name for the demonstrators. But do you just let someone like Milo go wherever he wants and spread his hate? That kind of argument can devolve into just sit on your hands and wait for it to pass.? And it doesn't. Anarchists also say their recent efforts have been wildly successful, both by focusing attention on their most urgent argument that Mr. Trump poses a fascist threat and by enticing others to join their movement. The number of people who have been showing up to meetings, the number of meetings, and the number of plans for future actions is through the roof, Legba Carrefour, who helped organize the Disrupt J20 protests on Inauguration Day in Washington, said in an interview. Gained 1, 000 followers in the last week, trumpeted @NYCAntifa, an Twitter account in New York, on Jan. 24. Pretty crazy for us as we've been active for many years with minimal attention. SMASH FASCISM!? The movement even claims to be finding adherents far afield of major population centers. A participant in CrimethInc, a anarchist network, pointed to rising attendance at its meetings and activity cropping up in new places like Omaha. The Left ignores us. The Right demonizes us,",2.0924592
14,4,Which leader of the fringe movement embracing white nationalism was punched in the face during the protests in Washington?,3,18254,"said. That's what we are seeing with Trump. Fueled in part by Mr. Trump's political success, violent clashes between the far right and far left erupted several times during the presidential campaign. In Anaheim, Calif. last February, three people were stabbed in a brawl after disrupted a Ku Klux Klan rally. And in Sacramento in June, at least five people were stabbed and eight wounded when hundreds of counterprotesters, including clashed with skinheads at a rally. But the confrontations seemed to shift into a new gear on the eve of Mr. Trump's inauguration. On Jan. 19, tried to block the entrance to the DeploraBall, a party for Trump supporters. The next day, 230 people were arrested after anarchists dressed in black broke the windows of a bank with baseball bats and set a limousine on fire. (Mr. Spencer, the white nationalist, whose assailant was not arrested, was not the only person struck: A videographer was struck in the chest with a flagpole he was unharmed as he tried to interview marching anarchists about what the word community? meant to them.) One of those arrested, a anarchist who insisted on anonymity to avoid aiding in his own prosecution, said the goal of the protests to get television stations to cut away from the inauguration, even for a moment had been met. Certainly, it has brought more attention to people who were against Trump and what he stands for, the man said by telephone. The question now is whether anarchists? efforts against Mr. Trump whether merely colorful and spirited, or lawless and potentially lethal will earn their fringe movement a bigger presence in the battle of ideas in years to come. It's true that a lot of people who consider themselves liberals or progressives still cling to the idea that you can effect social and economic change in the context of the state, through electoral politics, Mr. Laursen said. But more and more, it is going to become necessary for people on the left to think like anarchists if they are going to get anywhere. If the Berkeley disturbances have invited widespread denunciations, the punch of Mr. Spencer inflamed emotions on both the left and the right wing. Mr. Spencer has offered a reward for anyone who can identify his attacker, who wore the telltale clothing and of the anarchist black bloc. But anarchists in Philadelphia have already begun raising funds for the man's legal defense should he ever be caught. Under the hashtag #PunchRichardSpencerAgain, and anarchists across the country are vowing to continue the fight. May all your punches hit Nazis, read a headline on It's Going Down on Sunday. A few days earlier, the website gleefully announced on Twitter that Mr. Spencer was planning a tour of college campuses, adding, Everyone will get their chance!?",-0.19562556
15,5,"Who narrated the documentary ""I Am Not Your Negro""?",1,18228,"A few weeks ago, in reaction to something we had written about blackness and whiteness in recent movies, my colleague Manohla Dargis and I received a note from a reader. Since when is everything about race? he wanted to know. Perhaps it was a rhetorical question. A flippant though by no means inaccurate answer would have been 1619. But a more constructive response might have been to recommend Raoul Peck's new documentary, I Am Not Your Negro. Let me do so now, for that reader (if he's still interested) and for everybody else, too. Whatever you think about the past and future of what used to be called race relations? white supremacy and the resistance to it, in plainer English this movie will make you think again, and may even change your mind. Though its principal figure, the novelist, playwright and essayist James Baldwin, is a man who has been dead for nearly 30 years, you would be to find a movie that speaks to the present moment with greater clarity and force, insisting on uncomfortable truths and drawing stark lessons from the shadows of history. To call I Am Not Your Negro? a movie about James Baldwin would be to understate Mr. Peck's achievement. It's more of a posthumous collaboration, an uncanny and thrilling communion between the filmmaker whose previous work includes both a documentary and a narrative feature about the Congolese leader Patrice Lumumba and his subject. The narration (read by Samuel L. Jackson) is entirely drawn from Baldwin's work. Much of it comes from notes and letters written in the when Baldwin was somewhat reluctantly sketching out a book, never to be completed, about the lives and deaths of Medgar Evers, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. Reflections on those men (all of whom Baldwin knew well) and their legacies are interspersed with passages from other books and essays, notably The Devil Finds Work, Baldwin's 1976 meditation on race, Hollywood and the mythology of white innocence. His published and unpublished words some of the most powerful and penetrating ever assembled on the tortured subject of American identity accompany images from old talk shows and news reports, from classic movies and from our own decidedly present. Baldwin could not have known about Ferguson and Black Lives Matter, about the presidency of Barack Obama and the recrudescence of white nationalism in its wake, but in a sense he explained it all in advance. He understood the deep, contradictory patterns of our history, and articulated, with a passion and clarity that few others have matched, the psychological dimensions of racial conflict: the suppression of black humanity under slavery and Jim Crow and the insistence on it in politics and art the dialectic of guilt and rage, forgiveness and denial that distorts relations between black and white citizens in the North as well as the South the lengths that white people will go to wash themselves clean of their complicity in oppression. Baldwin is a double character in Mr. Peck's",4.536642
16,5,"Who narrated the documentary ""I Am Not Your Negro""?",2,18228,"his scorn, the weight of his disappointment, the gift of his trust. Recounting his visits to the South, where he reported on the civil rights movement and the murderous white response to it, Baldwin modestly described himself as a witness, a watchful presence on the sidelines of tragedy and heroism, an outsider by virtue of his Northern origins, his sexuality and his alienation from the Christianity of his childhood. But he was also a prophet, able to see the truths revealed by the contingent, complicated actions of ordinary people on both sides of the conflict. This is not to say that he transcended the struggle or detached himself from it. On the contrary, he demonstrated that writing well and thinking clearly are manifestations of commitment, and that irony, skepticism and a ruthless critical spirit are necessary tools for effective moral and political action. I Am Not Your Negro? is a thrilling introduction to his work, a remedial course in American history, and an advanced seminar in racial politics a concise, roughly movie with the scope and impact of a or a literary doorstop. It is not an easy or a consoling movie, but it is the opposite of bitter or despairing. I can't be a pessimist because I'm alive, Baldwin said. I'm forced to be an optimist.",1.9960593

I envision the audience to be that ocean of white folk I encounter who are deeply empathetic to the struggles of minorities they are the ones who ask me, What can I do, as a white person? This is my attempt to address them in the most useful and, hopefully, edifying manner. What's your strategy for getting through to the white people who may not be particularly sympathetic? What I've seen under the wonderful presidency of Barack Obama is the tendency to not tell white people the truth, for obvious reasons they don't vote for you. But I'm not a politician. I don't have that power or influence, but what I do wield is a different kind of bully pulpit. We have to have enough belief in white people to tell them the truth. They are grown! There are a lot of areas within race relations that seem like less of a conversation and more of an attempt to prove to white people that these issues police brutality, for instance are a real and present danger. I open this book with horror stories about my engagement with the police. These are the stories that have shaped me, that join me to the mass of people who, regardless of our station in life, regardless of educational attainment and achievement, have felt this. The president of the United States has these stories, the former attorney general has these stories and a prominent black intellectual like me has these stories. The reality is that this is part and parcel of what it means to be black in America, and I wanted to spend time talking and thinking about it from a number of different perspectives to show white brothers and sisters that we aren't making this up. This is not fabricated. I can't help but think that if the same levels of police brutality were happening to white people, we would just disband the police. Police brutality would not be seen as the price of keeping our society safe.

The decision to oust Mr. Christie's team, without quickly putting in place a new one, left the administration, which must still fill hundreds of top jobs, ill prepared for the nomination process. The vetting process is designed to identify issues about fitness and confirmability prior to public announcement, said Leslie B. Kiernan, a former deputy White House counsel for President Obama and now a partner with the law firm Akin Gump. The confirmation hearing for Mr. Puzder, the billionaire restaurant to head the Labor Department, was postponed several times because of a delay in filing his financial disclosure statement. Mr. Puzder's hearing is now scheduled for Thursday after the ethics office on Wednesday cleared his financial disclosure statement and ethics agreement. In the agreement, Mr. Puzder said that if confirmed, he would divest himself of his holdings in CKE Restaurants, the operator of the Hardee's and Carl's Jr. chains that he heads. Todd Ricketts, the deputy commerce secretary nominee, has not had a confirmation hearing yet, even though he was announced by the Trump team on Nov. 30. Mr. Ricketts is the scion of a wealthy family and of the Chicago Cubs. A letter on Feb. 7 to Mr. Ricketts by several Democratic senators asked him for more information about his political activity. Despite the setbacks for Mr. Trump, the administration has had ample resources at its disposal. One bipartisan program, called the Center for Presidential Transition, met with the remaining campaigns in the spring to offer advice on a process it calls big, complicated and dangerous. In the months before the election, the Office of Government Ethics also communicated with representatives for Mr. Trump. After his victory, the office offered to bring over supplies, including regulatory books and ethics guides, according to internal emails made public by the agency in response to records requests. But with the turnover at the Trump transition team in the wake of the election, the communication with the agency stopped. Walter M. Shaub Jr. director of the office, cautioned in a Nov. 18 email that cabinet nominees who did not make use of the office for prescreening posed the risk of embarrassment for the and his appointees. Mr. Shaub wrote in one email, We seem to have lost contact with the transition since the election. The messy start to the ethics process could still come back to haunt the administration. In 2000, when Mr. Bush faced a condensed timeline after the contested election in Florida, his team moved aggressively to minimize potential surprises, said Mr. Johnson, who was executive director of the transition. Their approach was to demand answers to the tough questions at the beginning of the process, before anyone was announced. It becomes you tell us everything we need to know, he said. If you don't tell us something, we drop you faster than a blink of an eye.",1.2407312

Puzder, who as President Trump's pick to head the Labor Department has come under fire for criticizing worker protections, acknowledged on Monday that he had employed an undocumented immigrant to clean his house. The revelation potentially could derail a nomination that has elicited controversy because of Mr. Puzder's views on overtime pay, sick leave and automation. The confirmation of Mr. Puzder, a chain executive, has stalled as he tries to divest holdings. My wife and I employed a housekeeper for a few years, during which I was unaware that she was not legally permitted to work in the U. S., Mr. Puzder said in a statement. When I learned of her status, we immediately ended her employment and offered her assistance in getting legal status. Mr. Puzder added that he and his wife had paid back taxes in full to the I. R. S. and the state of California. Confirmation hearings for Mr. Puzder have been delayed as he works to remove himself from his role as the chief executive of CKE Restaurants, whose holdings include the Carl's Jr. and Hardee's chains. Democrats have suggested that his nomination could be on shaky ground, in part, because he has yet to file standard disclosures and questionnaires to the Senate committee that will consider his confirmation. Progressive groups have echoed that sentiment. It's long past time for Mr. Puzder to deliver on his commitment to file paperwork with the Senate and let the American people know what issues are causing so many headaches for the Trump administration, Karl Frisch, executive director of Allied Progress, said on Monday. Mr. Puzder remains all in? for the confirmation process, a spokesman said on Monday. He is not the first cabinet nominee who has hired undocumented workers. Mr. Trump's choice to lead the Commerce Department, Wilbur Ross, said last month that he had employed an undocumented household worker for several years. And Representative Mick Mulvaney, Republican of South Carolina and the nominee for White House budget director, said that he failed to pay taxes on a nanny that he and his wife employed after their children were born.

As the world and our economic competitors move to expand their global footprints, we can't afford to be left behind in securing strong deals that will increase our access to new markets for products and services, Mr. Hatch said in a statement. I look forward to a vigorous discussion of Bob's trade philosophy and priorities. Mr. Trump has named a number of advisers on trade, leaving some ambiguity about the division of responsibilities. The named the economist Peter Navarro, an outspoken critic of China, to lead a new White House office overseeing trade and industrial policy. Mr. Trump also said Wilbur Ross, the billionaire investor and choice for commerce secretary, will play a key role. Mr. Lighthizer, however, is the only member of the triumvirate with government experience. Those who say U. S. T. R. will be subordinated to other agencies are mistaken, said Alan Wolff, another former senior American trade official who was the steel industry's on trade with Mr. Lighthizer for nearly 20 years, citing Mr. Lighthizer's encyclopedic knowledge of trade law. He'll be a dominant figure on trade, in harmony with Wilbur Ross and Navarro. There is also an ideological divide between the people Mr. Trump has named to oversee trade policy and his broader circle of advisers, which is populated by longstanding trade advocates like Gary D. Cohn, the president of Goldman Sachs, who will lead the National Economic Council Rex W. Tillerson, the chief executive of Exxon Mobil, tapped for secretary of state and Gov. Terry Branstad of Iowa, Mr. Trump's choice for ambassador to China. Proponents of trade hope the broader circle, and congressional Republicans, will exert a moderating influence. You're seeing a pretty clear indication that there will be a focus on the enforcement of our trade agreements and on the letter of the law, said Scott Lincicome, an international trade lawyer at White Case. But that doesn't necessarily mean a significant turn toward protectionism. Even free trade guys like me support enforcement. Trade opponents on the left and the right, meanwhile, are hoping Mr. Trump means to break with several decades of policy. There's going to be a war within the Trump administration on where they go with trade, and we're hoping to energize the worker base he had to make sure they go in the right direction to benefit the American worker, Mr. Trumka said. Mr. Trump's promise to immediately designate China as a currency manipulator may offer an early test of the administration's intentions. Economists see no evidence China is suppressing the value of its currency, although it has done so in the past.

21,7,Who is the federal judge that ordered President Trump's golf resort to pay $5.7 million for refusing to refund deposits to members?,1,18170,"In a highly unusual turn of events for a sitting president, a federal judge in Florida on Wednesday ordered a golf resort owned by President Trump to pay $5. 7 million for refusing to refund deposits to members who wanted to resign from the club. In his ruling, the judge said that Mr. Trump, by sending a letter in late 2012 denying access to members who wanted to resign from the Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter a process that could take years had set off a contract clause that should have resulted in an immediate refund of their membership fees. Instead, the money was withheld. The decision is the first court judgment against a company owned by Mr. Trump since he became president last month, and underscores that while Mr. Trump has stepped away from the operations of his company, he is certain to remain dogged by legal controversies connected to his business. At his new hotel in Washington, Mr. Trump is suing two celebrity chefs for breach of contract. The two men backed out of the Trump International Hotel development in 2015 after Mr. Trump made inflammatory comments about Mexican immigrants. Separately, the federal government owns the building that houses the hotel, and some legal experts have said that Mr. Trump may be in violation of his lease, which appears to prohibit federal elected officials from leasing the building. And last month, a lawsuit was filed in federal court in Manhattan contending that Mr. Trump had violated the emoluments clause of the Constitution by allowing his hotels and other businesses to accept payments from foreign governments. Mr. Trump has not sold any of his assets, which include golf courses, commercial real estate and marketing agreements. Rather he has handed the operations of his company over to his eldest sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, a move he hopes will reduce the appearance of conflict of interest. Wednesday's ruling by Judge Kenneth Marra of Federal District Court in West Palm Beach, an appointee of President George W. Bush's calls for the club to pay $4. 85 million in withheld fees to 65 club members involved in the lawsuit, plus an additional $925, 000 in interest and other costs. As a result, those members will receive refunds of $35, 000 to $200, 000, depending on their level of membership in the club. Amanda Miller, a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, said the company planned to appeal. At the time Trump purchased the club, it was suffering financially, making it unlikely that these members would ever get back their deposits, Ms. Miller said in a statement. At trial, we presented overwhelming evidence that the plaintiffs? memberships were never recalled and that the plaintiffs had waived this argument during the course of the litigation.

The dispute at the Jupiter club centered on contracts signed by club members with the facility's previous owner, . To join, members paid initiation fees as high as $210, 000, depending on the type of membership that they wanted. But under s rules those deposits were refundable when a member resigned. That process, however, could take years and while members on the resignation list waited for their turn to come up they could still use the club so long as they paid annual fees and other costs like food and beverage minimums. That all changed in 2012 when the Trump Organization bought the Jupiter club. Soon afterward, Mr. Trump sent a letter to members saying that those who wanted to resign were no longer welcome there. I do not want them to utilize the club, nor do I want their dues, the letter read. After club members sued, Mr. Trump testified in 2015 during a pretrial deposition that although he had signed the letter, it was his son, Eric Trump, who was in charge of policies at the family's golf courses. Eric is much more familiar with this club, his father said. He runs it. In his pretrial deposition, Eric Trump testified that nothing had changed and that club members seeking to resign had been allowed to use the club so long as they paid their dues. That claim, however, was disputed at trial last year. One member on the resignation list, Richard Slawson, testified that the club's membership manager told him soon after the Trumps took it over that the club was . But he continued to receive $6, 000 bills for annual dues and thousands in minimum charges for food and beverages that were never consumed. I couldn't believe that we were charged that when we were not allowed to use the club, Mr. Slawson, a Florida lawyer, said in a recent telephone interview. Confronted with such testimony, the younger Mr. Trump during his court testimony backed off his assertions and acknowledged he had been mistaken.

The resort doubles its initiation fee to $200, 000 leading to charges that the Trump Organization is cashing in on its founder's power. By President Trump's definition of voter fraud, his senior adviser, Steve Bannon, his Treasury secretary nominee and one of his daughters could be swept up in the investigation. The Twitter rebellion seems to be spreading as the Defense Department weighs in on Muslim refugees. The initiation fee at Mr. Trump's club in Florida which the president himself has called the Winter White House has doubled to $200, 000, after membership applications surged in the wake of Mr. Trump's election, the head of membership there said. Bernd Lembcke, the managing director at the Palm Beach, Fla. club, said the change in the initiation fee had been planned last fall, before the election, and that $200, 000 had been the fee before 2010, when it was cut in half because of the recession. But Mr. Lembcke, who has been at the club for 21 years, said that it also reflected the upswing in s popularity. We have had a sudden surge in requests, he said, adding that new members must be recommended by someone who is already a member, as is the case at many private clubs. Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen, a nonprofit group that promotes government ethics, said the move showed that Mr. Trump and his family intended to profit from his status as president. At the minimum, this creates the appearance of cashing in the presidency and selling direct personal access to the president, he said. It is unacceptable. And it demeans the office of the presidency. The new initiation fee went into effect on Jan. 1, although the annual dues remained the same $14, 000 a year, he said. The club has 482 members, with a cap of 500. It enhances it, Mr. Lembcke said of Mr. Trump's new job and its impact on the value of the membership. His presidency does. But we are very careful in vetting them, he added. News about the change in the initiation fee was reported by CNBC. By President Trump's definition, his senior White House adviser, Steve Bannon, is apparently committing voter fraud. So is his nominee to be the next Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin. So, apparently, is one of his daughters, Tiffany Trump. Mr. Trump was pretty broad with his definition of voter fraud when he took to Twitter Wednesday morning to request an investigation of the nefarious conduct of the 2016 electorate with no evidence to support it. There is, in fact, a difference between investigating actual voter fraud and cleaning up the voter rolls. If you move states, you aren't usually required to tell the state you are leaving that you no longer want to be on the roster. And so it goes that Mr. Bannon is registered in Sarasota County, Fla. and New York City. Mr. Mnuchin appears on the rolls of New York and California. And Tiffany Trump, should she choose,",-1.6204829

Tesla is the top maker of autos, and it completed its merger with SolarCity, a leading manufacturer of solar energy panels, days after the presidential election. Elon Musk, the visionary founder of both companies, openly criticized Mr. Trump's candidacy, saying on CNBC just before the vote that he was not the right guy? for the job. Mr. Musk has pressed for a carbon tax to combat global warming, which Mr. Trump once dismissed as a Chinese hoax. The mere mention of a carbon tax inflames the old guard of the energy industry. Moreover, both Tesla and SolarCity benefit from federal subsidies. Robert E. Murray, a coal executive and Trump supporter, has called Mr. Musk a fraud? for accepting $2 billion in government handouts. So why have Tesla shares surged since Mr. Trump's election, closing this week within striking distance of a record high? Adam Jonas, a prominent automotive analyst at Morgan Stanley, upgraded Tesla stock to overweight last week, with a target price of $305 a share. (It was trading this week at about $255.) When you look at the businesses Tesla is in, you see many areas of overlapping interest? with the Trump administration, Mr. Jonas told me. To the extent the new administration prioritizes the creation of valuable, innovative high tech and manufacturing jobs, Tesla stands at the epicenter of that. Shares in pure solar energy companies haven't fared as well, but even they have now regained nearly all the ground they lost immediately after Mr. Trump's victory. Solar investors aren't nearly as negative as they were the day after the election, said Andrew Hughes, an alternative energy analyst for Credit Suisse. One reason for that shift seems to be a budding bromance between Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk. The invited Mr. Musk to Trump Tower in December as part of a group of technology executives and named him to his strategic and policy forum of business leaders. And Mr. Musk was with a group of manufacturing executives at a White House meeting this week at which, according to a participant, he broached the subject of a carbon tax. Surprisingly, Mr. Trump didn't reject it out of hand. For his part, Mr. Musk this week endorsed Rex W. Tillerson, a pillar of the fossil fuel establishment as chief executive of Exxon Mobil, for secretary of state. Mr. Jonas said that the strategic relationship between Tesla leadership and the new administration is an important development? in his decision to upgrade Tesla stock. That Trump would be relying on Musk as an adviser has come as quite a surprise to many people, Mr. Jonas said.

Aaron Levie, chief executive of the data storage company Box, wrote on Twitter that on every level moral, humanitarian, economic, logical, etc. this ban is wrong and is completely antithetical to the principles of America. Over all, Mr. Levie said in an interview, there was a pretty resounding response from the tech industry showing how unacceptable this is. Beyond family heritage and employment, he noted, Silicon Valley cares about immigration because its companies strive to operate everywhere in the world. Almost every company's products Google, Apple, Airbnb has a global customer base, Mr. Levie said. These policy decisions have real implications to our partners, our customers, our competitors. The Trump administration is little more than a week old, but its relationship with Silicon Valley is already complicated. The tech industry did not like Mr. Trump the presidential candidate, despite his embrace of Twitter, and he returned the sentiment with caustic posts on the platform. Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist, said in 2015 that or of the C. E. O.s in Silicon Valley are from South Asia or from Asia, an incorrect statement that many in Silicon Valley perceived as racist. Yet a December meeting between the incoming administration and numerous tech chieftains was decidedly upbeat. We're going to be there for you, Mr. Trump promised to a room that included the leaders of Apple, Microsoft and Amazon. By early last week, the companies sensed trouble. Murtadha 24, an software engineer at Facebook, was told by a company lawyer on Tuesday that he needed to cut short a visit to Canada and return to the United States. The company feared that he would not be readmitted to the country because the president was expected to sign an executive order that would keep him out. It may be my na'vet? about how politics and industries interact, but I don't interpret the tech community's opposition to the president as a political stance, Mr. Tameemi said. It seemed more like a matter of values and a matter that impacts them. The larger tech companies tended to be less forceful in their reactions to the executive order than the smaller ones. Google said it was concerned. Apple said, It is not a policy we support. Amazon said only that it was committed to diversity. Oracle did not respond to requests for comment. On the other hand, Microsoft became more forceful as the weekend went on. On Saturday, its executives talked mostly about the virtues of immigration.

26,8,What business relationship between Donald Trump and Elon Musk surprised many people?,3,18391,"WASHINGTON President Trump lashed out on Wednesday at the Nordstrom department store chain for dropping his daughter Ivanka's accessories and clothing line, once again raising ethical questions about the relationship between his presidency and his family's sprawling business interests. Mr. Trump has already broken with tradition by singling out companies for criticism, like Boeing, Lockheed Martin, automakers and news organizations, sometimes causing gyrations in their stock prices and prompting debates about whether corporations would tailor their conduct to suit a bellicose president. But in those cases, his ire targeted government contracts, departing American jobs or news coverage not his own family's personal fortunes. Six days after Nordstrom announced that, based on sales, it would no longer carry Ms. Trump's products a decision that prompted some Trump supporters to call for a boycott of the stores the president took to Twitter to complain that Ivanka has been treated so unfairly? by the company. He first posted the message from his personal account, and then it from his official White House account. Mr. Trump's complaint also raised questions about how he might handle the moves of numerous other companies as their relationships with Trump brands change. The large national discount retailers T. J. Maxx and Marshalls, and Neiman Marcus, the luxury department store, for example, have recently taken steps to give less prominence to Ms. Trump's products. Sean Spicer, Mr. Trump's press secretary, said the president's tweet was not about business but about an attack on his daughter. For people to take out their concern about his actions, or his executive orders, on members of his family, he has every right to stand up for his family, Mr. Spicer said. It was not clear if Mr. Spicer was referring to critics of Mr. Trump who have called for a boycott of businesses bearing the family name, or to some political motive by Nordstrom. After the president temporarily barred people from seven countries from entering the United States, Nordstrom sent its employees a statement saying that it valued immigrants and offered support to those affected by the executive order. On Wednesday, responding to Mr. Spicer's comments, Nordstrom maintained that it had pulled Ms. Trump's products based on their declining sales performance. The company said it informed Ms. Trump of its decision in early January. Over the past year, and particularly in the last half of 2016, sales of the brand have steadily declined to the point where it didn't make good business sense for us to continue with the line for now, the Nordstrom statement said. We've had a great relationship with the Ivanka Trump team. As Mr. Trump has noted several times, the president is exempt from conflict of interest provisions in federal law that prohibit other government officials from using their positions to benefit themselves or their family members financially. So even if his post was meant to intimidate Nordstrom or other retailers that still work with Ivanka Trump, it probably does not violate conflict of interest rules, said ethics experts,",-0.62028384
27,9,Who vowed to take executive action on a nearly daily basis to unravel his predecessor's legacy and begin enacting his own agenda?,1,17838,"WASHINGTON President Trump plans to take executive action on a nearly daily basis for a month to unravel his predecessor's legacy and begin enacting his own agenda, his aides say, part of an extended exercise of presidential power to quickly make good on his campaign promises. But in a reflection of the improvisational style that helped fuel his rise, he has made few, if any, firm decisions about which orders he wants to make, or in which order. That is a striking break from past presidents, who have entered office with detailed plans for rolling out a series of executive actions that set a tone for their presidencies and send a clear message about their agendas. It was plain that Mr. Trump had devised no such strategy by his first day in office, as advisers expressed doubt until the last moments about whether he would issue any directives on Friday. It's going to be a decision, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, told reporters that afternoon. Then, around 7 p. m. reporters were suddenly summoned to the Oval Office. After sprinting from the briefing room, they watched Mr. Trump sign a directive to federal agencies to begin scaling back parts of the Affordable Care Act. There are a number that are being looked at, but it's just a question of which ones he feels like doing, and when, Mr. Spicer had said of executive orders earlier on Friday. In recent days, he had said that Mr. Trump's top aides were still deciding on the sequencing? of the unilateral actions. Still, there is little doubt about the policy areas in Mr. Trump's sights: international trade deals, illegal immigration, the fight against the Islamic State, climate change and Washington lobbying. In his first in office, Mr. Trump focused on health care, ordering the machinery of government to look for every opportunity to pull back on President Barack Obama's signature achievement by waiving fees or granting exemptions to states, businesses, individuals and insurance companies. He also moved quickly to freeze the Obama administration's unfinished regulations, a routine step for an incoming president of the opposite party. During the campaign, Mr. Trump railed against Mr. Obama's use of executive authority to sidestep an uncooperative Congress on issues like immigration and health care. After his victory, Mr. Trump vowed to use those same powers to quickly reverse the country's ideological course. Aides said they hoped to group Mr. Trump's executive actions thematically for maximum impact. They gave few other details, though some advisers suggested that executive actions on illegal immigration could be among the first issued after the inaugural weekend. Advocates for undocumented workers are anxiously waiting to see what Mr. Trump will do. If he moves aggressively, he could immediately overturn Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA the program Mr. Obama created to protect young immigrants who were brought illegally to the United States as children, giving them legal status and access to work permits. Ending that program would put as many",8.828723
28,9,Who vowed to take executive action on a nearly daily basis to unravel his predecessor's legacy and begin enacting his own agenda?,2,17977,"WASHINGTON When President Obama relied heavily on executive orders to push through policies that had no chance in Congress, Republicans called him a dictator who abused his power and disregarded the Constitution. They even took him to court. We have an increasingly lawless presidency where he is actually doing the job of Congress, writing new policies and laws without going through Congress, Representative Paul D. Ryan, then the Budget Committee chairman, said in a 2014 television interview after Mr. Obama made clear in his State of the Union address that he would readily take unilateral action to get his way. Now President Trump, at the start of his tenure, is relying heavily on executive actions not just to reverse Obama administration initiatives, but to enact new federal policies covering immigration, health care and other areas in ways that could be seen more as the province of the House and Senate. And he is doing that with clear Republican majorities in Congress. The flurry of administration edicts flowing from the Trump White House puts some top Republicans in the awkward position of welcoming aggressive executive muscle flexing from a president of their own party after castigating Mr. Obama for using the same approach. Their rationale: Mr. Obama took executive action too far, stretching the intent of legislation to fulfill an ideological agenda. We've never been against executive action, said Ashlee Strong, a spokeswoman for Mr. Ryan, now the House speaker. We're against overreaching, illegal action. Mr. Trump's eager embrace of the executive order he signaled clearly during his campaign that he intended to follow his predecessor's lead allows him to claim immediate progress on his campaign promises rather than waiting for a lengthy legislative process to play out. Many of his major proposals building a border wall, hiring more border and immigration officers, creating a new office for victims of crimes committed by immigrants in the country illegally will presumably require funding by Congress, and that is no certainty in the current political environment. The question then becomes how Mr. Trump would proceed if Congress balks. House Republicans are currently suing the executive branch and winning in a case that argues the Obama administration spent more than $13 billion on health insurance subsidies without necessary congressional approval in a clear breach of the Constitution. The health care executive order issued by Mr. Trump last week directed federal officials to find ways to minimize the financial burden of the health care law on governments, health care providers and others. Many saw the move as a backdoor attempt by the new White House to undermine the current law of the land while Republicans try to figure out a way to repeal it. It was the reverse of the type of action Republicans criticized President Obama for using his executive powers to prop up the health care law without sufficient authority. But there were no loud complaints from Republicans this time, a fact not lost on Democrats. Congressional Republicans? hypocritical acquiescence to President Trump's",0.74575365

Mr. Obama also decided well in advance which executive actions he wanted to take in his first days, after a team of lawyers led by Gregory B. Craig, his first White House counsel, spent much of his transition planning what he could do without Congress to illustrate a stark break with George W. Bush's presidency. On his second full day in office, Mr. Obama ordered the closing of the Guantnamo Bay prison a directive still unfulfilled and banned torture by mandating that terrorism interrogations be guided by the Army Field Manual. Mr. Obama's embrace of executive orders early in the administration and later, when a Congress blocked his legislative agenda may have helped pave the way for Mr. Trump to take quick action. Since many of Mr. Obama's achievements were put in place with executive action, Mr. Trump can reverse them, at least over time, the same way.",-2.1382177
30,10,What was Hubert Edward Spires's discharge status changed to by the Air Force Board for the Correction of Military Records?,1,17544,"For more than half a century, Hubert Edward Spires has lived with the painful memory of being kicked out of the Air Force as a young gay sergeant in the 1940s. The word undesirable? was printed on his discharge records. But now, at 91, Mr. Spires said he can finally be at peace with that part of his life. On Friday, he was awakened by a phone call to his Connecticut home and learned that the Air Force Board for the Correction of Military Records had agreed to change his status. This time, his discharge would be described as honorable. It was a long haul, Mr. Spires said on Tuesday in phone call from his home in Norwalk. I got the confirmation that I had been looking for. Said his husband, David Rosenberg, whom he met in 1956 and married eight years ago: His first words were, It's about time.? Mr. Spires is one of the hundreds of gay former military personnel who have been emboldened by the 2010 repeal of the United States military's Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy, which prohibited gay men and lesbians from serving openly in the military. In 2011, the federal government allowed changes to veterans? military records, some of which had been labeled undesirable? or other than honorable. The incentives for doing so were sometimes financial. Such designations could make it difficult for the men and women who had served to get employment, loans or access to veterans benefits. But there was another, more important reason. The respect factor, said Matt Thorn, an executive director at Legal Defense Network, which helps veterans with the application process needed to reverse such designations. I served my country honorably I want that respect. And they should have that. Mr. Thorn said many go through an application process that can take up to 18 months. But for Mr. Spires, who recently recovered from pneumonia, it took years of effort that will now allow him to have a burial, when the time comes, with military honors. I have to quietly go back into my shell now, he said. Because I am 91 years old, and my health is not all it should be. I can't take on jobs that require energy because I don't have it anymore, but I had it long enough to fight the G. D. Air Force and win, he said. Brooke Brzozowske, a spokeswoman for the Air Force, said the service branch had denied 27 out of 157 requests for upgrades since the policy was repealed. We were not necessarily discharging people for just being gay, she said. It was associated with misconduct if it was a dishonorable discharge. The military corrections board first received Mr. Spires's application to get his status upgraded in 2014, but some of his discharge records had been destroyed in a fire in 1973 that also consumed those of other veterans of World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War, according to a copy of the records board",6.5608892

Other documents found in 2016 showed he served in the military from 1946 to 1948, when he was discharged from Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio. To help his case, Mr. Spires also filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court for the District of Connecticut in November, assisted by the Yale Law School's Veterans Legal Services Clinic. The lawsuit asserted that Mr. Spires's rights had been violated after he encountered unreasonable delays in the Air Force review to change his discharge status to honorable. According to the lawsuit and to Mr. Spires account, his life as a young chaplain's assistant at the base included playing the organ at services and typing letters to distressed families. He attended social events with gay men outside of the base, he said. At a Halloween party in 1947, Mr. Spires dressed in a costume inspired by a sparkly laundry soap. Someone at the party informed his superiors that he was in drag, the lawsuit said. He was interrogated by military officials, threatened with a and sent to hearings and psychiatrists, the suit says. He signed a statement saying he had engaged in homosexual acts? to end an interrogation, the lawsuit said. I never did anything on the base in uniform, he said. I had a whole slew of very good friends who were gay and lived off base. We partied together we had wonderful meals together and went to the opera together. We lived a very normal life. I did not dishonor the Air Force in any way by my actions, Mr. Spires said in the interview. He was discharged and sent home to Lancaster, Ohio, in civilian clothes. Over the years, he destroyed his military records for fear his Catholic family would find out, he said. He found work in department stores and other jobs. He met Mr. Rosenberg in 1956 at a s'ance in New York. They have been companions ever since, marrying in 2009, Mr. Spires said. The court did not rule on Mr. Spires's lawsuit, as the Air Force board resumed its review of Mr. Spires's application. It finally said in its letter last week that he had no misconduct in the military and concluded there was the existence of an injustice. Its recommendation: an honorable discharge dating to March 17, 1948. I had a terrible time, Mr. Spires said. But now I have been able to put so much of that behind me, and now that I have got my honorable discharge, I hope these negative thoughts will leave me permanently.

His private health insurance covered the treatment, but left him deep in debt. He applied repeatedly for free veterans? health care for radiation but was denied. His medical records from the military all said he had not been exposed. When the job was done, they threw my bulldozer in the ocean because it was so hot, Mr. Laird said. If it got that much radiation, how the hell did it miss me? As the cleanup continued, federal officials tried to institute safety measures. A shipment of yellow radiation suits arrived on the islands in 1978, but in interviews veterans said that they were too hot to wear in the tropical sun and that the military told them that it was safe to go without them. The military tried to monitor plutonium inhalation using air samplers. But they soon broke. According to an Energy Department memo, in 1978, only a third of the samplers were working. All troops were issued a small film badge to measure radiation exposure, but government memos note that humid conditions destroyed the film. Failure rates often reached 100 percent. Every evening, Air Force technicians scanned workers for plutonium particles before they left Runit. Men said dozens of workers each day had screened positive for dangerous levels of radiation. Sometimes we'd get readings that were all the way to the red, said one technician, David Roach, 57, who now lives in Rockland, Me. None of the high readings were recorded, said Mr. Roach, who has since had several strokes. Two members of Congress wrote to the secretary of defense in 1978 with concerns, but his office told them not to worry: Suits and respirators ensured the cleanup was conducted in a manner as to assure that radiation exposure to individuals is limited to the lowest levels practicable. Even after the cleanup, many of the islands were still too radioactive to inhabit. In 1988, Congress passed a law providing automatic medical care to any troops involved in the original atomic testing. But the act covers veterans only up to 1958, when atomic testing stopped, excluding the Enewetak cleanup crews. If civilian contractors had done the cleanup and later discovered declassified documents that show the government failed to follow its own safety plan, they could sue for negligence. Veterans don't have that right. A 1950 Supreme Court ruling bars troops and their families from suing for injuries arising from military service. The veterans? only avenue for help is to apply individually to the Department of Veterans Affairs for free medical care and disability payments. But the department bases decisions on old military records including defective air sampling and radiation badge data that show no one was harmed. It nearly always denies coverage.

33,11,What advice was given to Mr. LaCasse regarding restructuring his student loans to aid his retirement savings?,1,17434,"to squirrel away more. THE ADVICE Stephanie Sherman, a certified financial planner at Prudential, said that Mr. LaCasse might be able to restructure his student loans to give himself more breathing room. If he has a great credit score, he can refinance them and make the same payment and pay them off quicker, or free up more money for savings, she said. Mr. LaCasse said he had already considered refinancing and was thinking about it more seriously after hearing Ms. Sherman's advice. The process seems so daunting, and it keeps getting pushed aside, he said. Now I feel more motivated to do it. If she is able to break into theater or film, Ms. Craven would like to keep working for a lifetime. As an actor, I'm going to want to tell stories and do that as long as I can, she said. Even so, she hopes by her late 60s or early 70s to prioritize family time and traveling. Though she has never had a job with retirement benefits, she would be comfortable putting aside 5 to 10 percent of her $45, 000 income on her own. She already has $7, 500 in savings, but not in a formal retirement account. Her main concern is seasonal fluctuations in her salary that could derail a savings plan. I'm in a very busy season for work right now, so I'm making more money, but once the tourists go away, it'll be back to scraping by, Ms. Craven said. THE ADVICE Ms. Craven said she felt she wasn't doing enough to save for retirement, but the experts saw things differently. Mollie sounds like she has it all together, Ms. Sherman said, noting how much she already has in savings. She didn't deny that seasonal income fluctuations were a challenge, but said that there were many ways to plan around them. She suggested that Ms. Craven find a financial adviser to develop a personalized strategy and perhaps open an independent retirement account. Ms. Sherman also explained that many people in the entertainment field built retirement benefit credits through organizations that they worked for, but that these benefits were not always well advertised to contractors. Ms. Craven said that she was fairly certain she had not accrued retirement credits through her performances, but was interested in finding an adviser and considering a formal retirement account. It does seem disheartening that the savings account that I have just sits there and doesn't grow hardly at all, maybe a cent every month or so, she said. I'd love to put some of that away and not touch it. Although he has worked at his current company, Redwood Logistics, for more than three years, Mr. Ruger has been hesitant to invest in its 401( k).

Though she has no other formal savings, Ms. King owns a house and contributes 10 percent of her $ salary to the account, with the university contributing an additional 14 percent. Ms. King is paying off student loans but expects to be by the end of the winter, at which point she will be able to diversify her savings plan and increase her contributions by as much as 25 or 50 percent. THE ADVICE Cherita certainly seems on paying off her student loans, Ms. Sherman said. She also seems very focused on redirecting that to increasing her retirement savings. Ms. Sherman and Ms. Vacura agreed that Ms. King was in a good position for retirement, though they recommended that she open a separate rainy day? savings account. Ms. King said the rainy day fund was her next priority after paying off her student loans. And she was happy her efforts had won good reviews. It's validating to hear that people who know about finance are saying I'm on the right track, she said. Ms. Hamilton has been planning for her retirement since she was 17. I took a class in high school, and they showed me the building of compounding interest, she said. That prompted her to get a weekend job and put her earnings into an I. R. A. which has grown to about $30, 000. She also has a separate 401( k) through her employer, with a similar amount invested. I want to work really hard now and save really hard so I can travel the world and not have to worry about finances? in retirement, Ms. Hamilton said. Her husband is a strong partner in her savings plan. When they married last year, they agreed to live on a single income and put the rest into savings: They already have more than $100, 000. Ms. Hamilton is very reluctant to touch her primary income for anything beyond basic necessities. When the time came to buy new furniture, she got a weekend job at Restoration Hardware to cover the expense. THE ADVICE Ms. Sherman of Prudential said that while Ms. Hamilton would seem to be a model of thrift, she could be even more proactive, perhaps by buying life insurance or opening a retirement savings plan. Really start to address the things that could derail your retirement, as you're a fabulous saver, she suggested. Ms. Hamilton said that her personal financial adviser gave similar feedback and that she was encouraged to be receiving such consistent advice about reaching her goals. I may not make a million dollars a year, but I feel like I can one day hopefully have a retirement that's comparable, she said.",-0.22423734
35,11,What advice was given to Mr. LaCasse regarding restructuring his student loans to aid his retirement savings?,3,18174,"possible advice (rather than, say, advice that pays those advisers the highest fees). It's a very simple principle, Mr. Obama said at the time. You want to give financial advice, you've got to put your client's interests first. For most financial advisers, becoming a fiduciary was no big deal, because they had been giving good advice anyway. For instance, the investment firm Merrill Lynch said it would voluntarily hold its retirement advisers to the new standard. We view the Department of Labor Fiduciary Rule as a positive step for the industry and great news for investors, reads a company web page. Other investment firms, however, were less enthusiastic about the new rules and began furious attacks. Their objections ranged from the ridiculous (suggesting that tens of thousands of financial advisers would retire en masse to protest the new rule) to the legitimate (profits of some advisers are likely to fall, and the fees paid by some investors may rise under the new rule what's more, there will most likely be some lawsuits against a small number of advisers as everyone tries to figure out how the new rules work). When Donald J. Trump was elected president, the new fiduciary rules weren't complete, and now some of his advisers are urging him to freeze or overturn them. The fiduciary rule might be the dumbest decision to come out of the U. S. government in the last 50 to 60 years, Anthony Scaramucci, an investment manager and newly appointed White House official, said at a conference, vowing to repeal it as soon as we can. Republicans in Congress have introduced legislation to kill the rules. In truth, this battle is part of a broader clash within the federal government that is likely to shape Mr. Trump's presidency. At the core of those who oppose the new fiduciary rules is a basic belief: People ought to bear more responsibility for monitoring their finances and lives. The fiduciary standard, its critics claim, does a disservice to the nation by placing the burden of financial accountability on advisers, rather than on us, the people who should be paying attention to what occurs with our bank accounts. We should be expected to scrutinize the advice we receive, these critics say, rather than accept it unthinkingly. A fiduciary protection enfeebles us by guaranteeing we'll receive only good advice. That argument might seem preposterous what's the point of seeking advice if you can't trust the advice giver? until you consider situations like Johnny Depp's. (See, I promised we'd get back to him.) Mr. Depp's situation is so complicated that, in most ways, the federal fiduciary rules don't apply. And his lawsuit will be unaffected by whatever President Trump proposes, because it has been filed in state court. Nonetheless, his suit is illuminating, because it demonstrates that instead of glibly dismissing the rules? critics, we ought to acknowledge the challenges they voice. Consider, for instance, the claims made by Mr. Depp's lawyers that the Management Group never once paid",-2.8953168
36,12,What word did The New York Times ultimately choose to describe President Trump's assertion about illegal voting in the headline?,1,17972,"Words matter. And from the moment he became president, Donald J. Trump has unleashed so many of consequence that the public has barely had time to parse their full implication. Words about the dishonest media, the end of Obamacare, the construction of that border wall with Mexico this is an abbreviated list, and he hasn't even completed his first week in office. Amid the verbal deluge, President Trump this week repeated an assertion he made shortly after his election: that millions of ballots cast illegally by undocumented immigrants cost him the popular vote. If true, this would suggest the wholesale corruption of American democracy. Not to worry: As far as anyone knows, the president's assertion is akin to saying that millions of unicorns also voted illegally. But such a baseless statement by a president challenged the news media to find the precise words to describe it. This will be a recurring challenge, given President Trump's habit of speaking in hyperbole and his tendency to deride any report as fake news. The words needed to be exactly right. And the language has a rich vocabulary for describing statements that fall short of the truth, said Geoffrey Nunberg, a linguist who teaches at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Information. They're baseless, they're bogus, they're lies, they're untruths. ? Rarely are these words, each with its own nuance, applied directly to something said by a president, though others have also dissembled (like Bill Clinton on whether he had sex with an intern). This is the very unique situation that we find ourselves in as journalists and as a country, said Joshua Benton, the director of the Nieman Journalism Lab at Harvard University. We have an administration that seems to be asserting a right to its own facts and doesn't seem to be able to produce evidence to back those claims. Still, carefully chosen words can capture that. A whole vocabulary has come bubbling up that would not have been used five years ago, Mr. Nunberg said in an interview. People are going to have to sit down and decide: Are we going to want to go over the moral consequences of telling an untruth? The mere fact of it being untrue? Or the fact that it's bogus, baseless or groundless? Some news organizations used words like falsely? or wrongly? adverbs that tend to weaken the impact in framing what the president said. Some used with no evidence, or won't provide any proof, or unverified claims, or repeats debunked claim. The New York Times, though, ultimately chose more muscular terminology, opting to use the word lie? in the headline. After initially using the word falsely, it switched to lie? online and then settled on Meeting With Top Lawmakers, Trump Repeats an Election Lie? for Tuesday's print edition. People noticed, and debated its use. That is because, from the childhood schoolyard to the grave, this is a word neither used nor taken lightly.

(Nota bene: The tweet actually contains what might be considered two untruths or falsehoods, or erroneous assertions, or bogus claims since Mr. Trump's victory was no landslide, but among the closer elections in American history.) Mr. Baquet said he fully understood the gravity of using the word lie, whether in reference to an average citizen or to the president of the United States. He emphasized that it should be used sparingly, partly because the term carries such negative connotations, and partly so that it does not lose potency. On the other hand, we should be letting people know in no uncertain terms that it's untrue, Mr. Baquet said, referring to the president's assertion of a epidemic. He repeated it without a single grain of evidence, and it's a very powerful statement about the electoral system. Mr. Baquet said that emails from readers seemed split on the appropriateness of the word's use. Meanwhile, Mr. Benton, of the Nieman Journalism Lab, applauded its use as a noun in the Times headline (?Trump Repeats an Election Lie?) in this construction, he said, the lie can exist as a reality distinct from the speaker's intention. Over all, the tension between the Trump administration and much of the mainstream media is what's the word? Troubling, according to Sara Brady, a specialist based in Florida. She says that a complete breakdown of the already fractious relationship affects everyone. The media run the risk of being disrespectful to the president of the United States, she said.

The issue of Trump and labels came up in a different context this week when The Times called one of his baseless claims a lie in a headline: Trump Repeats Lie About Popular Vote in Meeting With Lawmakers. The majority of readers who wrote in wrote to applaud The Times for doing so. Some other readers, however, were warier, arguing that The Times would never be able to find its way inside Trump's mind. We went to the associate managing editor for standards, Phil Corbett, for his take on the issue. The public editor's take: These parameters make sense to me. My vote is for using the word lie? in a highly limited way, under specific circumstances and with approval, as I've written before. As some of our readers point out, the intent of the person called out for lying matters. It can't be just the routine stuff of the spin room. Shortly after the election, The Times ran an piece by Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, in which he wrote, When you call us the Rust Belt, you demean our work and diminish who we are. A reader wrote in then to applaud. This week, Derck wrote in again when The Times ran a story on the front page with the headline: In a Rust Belt Town, the Women's March Draws Shrugs and Cheers From Afar. No, I'm not going to give this up, she wrote.

We shared Derck's letters with the national editor, Marc Lacey, who said: The public editor's take: Lacey's answer is spot on.

The book is filled with Nabokov's own observations about an America that still felt foreign and exciting to him. Isabel Allende, The House of the Spirits? (1982) Country of origin: ChileReasons for leaving: Allende fled to Venezuela in 1973 after the coup that brought down Salvador Allende, the socialist leader and her father's cousin. She moved to California in the late 1980s. Drawing on the circumstances of her own exile, Allende used her debut novel to tell a multigenerational saga that takes place in an unnamed country very much like Chile. We see the destruction of democracy and the rise of a cruel dictator who tries to eliminate all opposition. I wanted to show that life goes in a circle, events are intertwined, and that history repeats itself, there is no beginning and no end, Allende said about her sprawling, narrative. Czeslaw Milosz, Bells in Winter? (1985) Country of origin: PolandReason for leaving: After surviving World War II in Poland and initially joining the postwar Communist government, Milosz defected in 1951, eventually emigrating to the United States in 1960. The Polish poet and Nobel Prize winner produced a quietly meditative work in 1985 that pointed toward the mysterious quality of existence, the inability to fully understand our own natures. Life was impossible, but was endured, he writes in Recess, capturing the exile's lament, the alienation of deracination, of living an arm's length away from oneself. Joseph Brodsky, Less Than One? (1986) Country of origin: Soviet UnionReason for leaving: Put on trial and into psychiatric institutions for his dissident beliefs, Brodsky was expelled from the Soviet Union in 1972. Brodsky was interested in the poet's role in society, and these essays, which deal with politics, literature and his own personal experience of exile, all get at this question. For him, poetry was the most democratic art, as he says in an essay about the West Indian poet Derek Walcott. It's the poet's embrace of individuality that makes him a necessary counterpoint an important thorn to the state. Nuruddin Farah, Maps? (1986) Country of origin: SomaliaReasons for leaving: Exiled from Somalia in the for writing about life under the harsh rule of the dictator Mohammed Siad Barre. In the first novel of his trilogy, Blood in the Sun, Farrah writes about a young man, an orphan, obsessed with his own origins. Growing up dislocated in the big city of Mogadishu and tormented by the need to avenge his father's death, the boy reflects all the struggles of national identity in a country torn from the traditional past and thrust into a violent future. Ariel Dorfman, Death and the Maiden?

Threshold which has published books by Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, Dick Cheney and, recently, Mr. Trump was appealing to Mr. Yiannopoulos because they don't shy away from publishing controversial figures, Mr. Flannery said. But the fury Simon Schuster has encountered underscores the perils publishers face as they tailor their publishing plans to reflect volatile new political realities. Mr. Yiannopoulos, who is gay and describes himself in interviews as more of a cultural figure than a political one, is unlikely to appeal to older or more religious conservatives. His book Dangerous? which will address his relationship to the his role as a crusader and his banishment from Twitter is more of a memoir than a new conservative manifesto. Marji Ross, the president and publisher of Regnery, a conservative publishing house, said she considered Mr. Yiannopoulos's book proposal but did not pursue it because she felt it would be too polarizing among mainstream conservatives. Some of our market would have loved it, and some of our market would have been very uncomfortable with it, Ms. Ross said. It is a dilemma many conservative writers and editors are now facing. As the political ideology of the right has been injected with populism and nationalism, conservative writers and publishers are wrestling with how to reach a wide audience now that a block of readers that was once reliably in lock step philosophically has splintered. Once dependable formulas for generating best sellers write a book attacking the Clintons, plug it on Fox News, repeat may no longer deliver a hit. The 2016 election turned the political world upside down, and it also turned the publishing world upside down, said Matt Latimer, a literary agent at Javelin whose clients include conservative writers. The audience has fractured. A few years ago, a Paul Ryan book was widely embraced by conservative book buyers. Would Trump voters buy a Paul Ryan book today? I don't know. authors are also losing a reliable driver of book sales the Clintons. Last year, Regnery alone had three books that took aim at Mrs. Clinton, including its first graphic novel, Clinton Cash, adapted from the book by Peter Schweizer, and Hillary's America, Mr. D'Souza's book, which sold more than 200, 000 copies. We had certainly planned to take advantage of those opportunities if Hillary Clinton had won the election, and we looked at several books that we had signed up or considered the day after the election and thought, well, those aren't going to work, Ms. Ross said. Oftentimes, we have said here that what's bad for America is good for Regnery book sales. Regnery has instead pivoted to courting Trump voters with forthcoming books like How Trump Won, by the Breitbart Joel Pollak and Larry Schweikart, and a series of Deplorables Guides? to issues like immigration, gun control and climate change, using a moniker Trump's supporters",-5.651745
41,13,What is the title of Vladimir Nabokov's controversial novel published in 1955?,3,17958,"MOSCOW Russian lawmakers on Wednesday moved to decriminalize some forms of domestic battery for offenders who do not do serious physical harm to their victims. Members of the State Duma passed the controversial amendment to the Russian criminal code in its second reading, which essentially assures it will go to President Vladimir V. Putin for his signature. The amendment treats a first conviction for domestic battery as an administrative offense, carrying a penalty of a $500 fine or 15 days in jail. If Mr. Putin signs the measure into law, only injuries like concussions or broken bones, or repeated offenses committed in a family setting, would lead to criminal charges. Defenders of the measure say it will protect parents? rights to discipline their children and generally reduce the state's role in domestic life. In the traditional Russian family culture, relations between fathers and sons? are built upon the authority of parents? power, mutual love and personal indispensability as the basis for children's upbringing, said Yelena B. Mizulina, one of the initiators of the new legislation and author of a law that banned gay propaganda? aimed at minors. Opponents called it a step back to medieval times and a license for violent behavior by domestic tyrants. It is clear that lawmakers recognized violence as a norm of family life, said Svetlana G. Aivazova, a Russian specialist in gender studies. This shows that Duma deputies are not simply conservative or traditional, it shows that they are archaic. Ms. Aivazova and other experts say that Russia has a serious problem with domestic violence. Citing data provided by Russia's Interior Ministry, Ms. Aivazova told Mr. Putin in 2015 that 40 percent of all grave violent crimes are committed in families. In 2013, she said, more than 9, 000 women died in criminal assaults and more than 11, 000 were badly injured. In 2014, she said, more than 25 percent of all murders were committed in families. In the United States, by comparison, 11, 766 women were killed by a husband or boyfriend in the years 2001 to 2012, an average of about 1, 000 a year in a country with about twice the population of Russia. Ms. Aivazova asked Mr. Putin to support a special law on the prevention of domestic violence that had already been passed in 143 countries, including Russia's neighbors Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. Mr. Putin thanked her, but the law remained in the State Duma, and Ms. Aivazova said she was not optimistic about its prospects. In the past, Mr. Putin has expressed concern about domestic violence, even in the absence of serious injury. I think we should not slap children and justify it based on some old traditions, he told journalists at his last news conference in December. There is a short distance from slaps to beating. The new legislation was pushed by conservative members of the Russian parliament and the Russian Orthodox Church, who were incensed last summer when lawmakers criminalized domestic violence, acting upon a recommendation by the",-5.792182

She expected that her husband, Husham and her two other sons would soon join her from Amman, Jordan, finally bringing the family together after a tumultuous decade of surviving the Iraq war, fleeing to Jordan and then searching for a permanent home. But on Friday, the family was dealt another blow, after President Trump approved a sweeping executive order on immigration that, among other things, blocked entry into the United States for 90 days for citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries including Iraq, where members of the family are citizens. Her husband and two sons in Jordan are for now locked out of the United States, and Ms. Obaidi cannot travel away, or risk being denied . Now our family in the U. S. can't even come to visit us, nor can we visit them, Mr. Qadhi said on Saturday in Amman. We just sit and watch like the rest of the world what is happening, and our fate is being decided for us, in front of our eyes. The family lived in Baghdad as American tanks, troops and missiles tore into the Iraqi capital in 2003. It stayed for several years, despite gunfire and bomb blasts outside its house and the kidnapping of several family members. The family helped American soldiers even though other Iraqis targeted it for doing so. One of the sons in Amman, Thabit said he and his father had run a snack bar on an American base in Baghdad, serving candy and soft drinks to troops, and operated a internet cafe, which required them to be vetted and approved to begin work. After Thabit was kidnapped in 2006 by Qaeda terrorists and eventually released, he said, he reported details about the episode to American officials in the hope that they would be caught. And on his way home from the Baghdad base one day, he came upon four American troops injured along the road, and he said he had loaded them into his car and driven them to the Green Zone. America has abandoned its responsibility to protect those who protected and cooperated with the Americans, he said. It's a decision solely based on my religious faith. It's discrimination solely on religious grounds. He added: This is the wrong decision. Is it even constitutional? The family's home was along one of Baghdad's major highways, an entry point for American troops during the invasion. The family huddled in a windowless section of the home for 10 days, as bullets shattered windows and rockets blazed through the sky, until the United States took control of Baghdad. In the years after the invasion, the family remained in Iraq, even as unrest spread, militants took up arms and tensions between Sunnis and Shiites flared up.

Ms. Conway was responding to a Trump family clash with Nordstrom, the department store chain, which has dropped Ms. Trump's line. On Wednesday, the president used his personal and White House Twitter accounts to lash out at Nordstrom, saying that the company had treated his daughter so unfairly. Those comments are the latest in a series of ethical questions about the relationship between his official role and his family's interests. Ms. Conway's remarks amounted to using your government position as kind of a walking billboard for products or services offered by a private individual, said Laurence Tribe, a professor of constitutional law at Harvard. She is attempting quite crudely to enrich Ivanka and therefore the president's family. Ordinarily, such conduct might be handled with a letter of reprimand, though it could lead to termination, legal experts said, but those decisions are largely up to the individual agency. I think this is a violation, but I'd like to hear an argument as to why it's not, said Lawrence M. Noble, general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit advocacy group, who was formerly the top lawyer and ethics officer at the Federal Election Commission. She was speaking on behalf of the White House, in her official position, which makes it more serious. Richard W. Painter, chief ethics counsel under President George W. Bush, said Ms. Conway's conduct would not have been tolerated in that administration. Recent events show that the president and the people close to him do not intend to make meaningful distinctions between his official capacity as president and the Trump family business, he said. Of Mr. Trump's aides, Mr. Painter said, Instead of trying to push him back on this, they're jumping in this and shilling for the businesses alongside him. Nordstrom, one of several retailers to reduce or eliminate its ties to Ms. Trump's line of clothes, jewelry and accessories, said its decision to do so was based purely on sales performance. But deep division in views of Mr. Trump have put retailers in a bind. Critics of the president have called for a boycott of products and the stores that sell them, while his supporters have called for a boycott of stores that drop them. Ms. Conway said that Ms. Trump was being targeted by people who disliked her father. They're using her to get to him, Ms. Conway said on Thursday. The president and his daughter have pledged to distance themselves from their various businesses. Ms. Trump has stepped away from her leadership role at the Ivanka Trump brand, and she and her father have resigned as executives at the Trump Organization.

On ? the Johnson family is led by Dre, a marketing executive, and Bow, a doctor. They have four children in private school and a house in an affluent, predominantly white neighborhood in Los Angeles. They took a vacation to Disney World estimated to cost more than $20, 000. But despite the family's seeming stability, is largely about class tension. A central dilemma is Dre's battle between his financial aspirations and racial authenticity, his and his loyalty to his roots. One of the best episodes this season, Jack of All Trades, opens with Dre (Anthony Anderson) and Bow (Tracee Ellis Ross) learning of their young twins? career test results: Diane (Marsai Martin) might be in a position of power in a political organization, while Jack (Miles Brown) is likely to be a member of a unionized group of skilled laborers. Despite Jack's obvious excitement about, and talent for, the manual trades, his parents become obsessed with redirecting his career trajectory, worried that he will be pigeonholed, like Dre's father, Pops (Laurence Fishburne) in a job for the rest of his life. As Pop's presence reminds us, while Dre's parents worked hard to provide him with an education, Dre did not inherit wealth, making his status both new and fragile. This is a legitimate worry because more and more members of the middle class are finding themselves in an economic downslide, with little hope that the next generation will earn more than the one before. In 2015, the Pew Research Center released a report detailing that the number of American households earning a income had reached its lowest point in over 40 years. And the gap between the wealth of white and black families has widened to its highest level since 1989, according to a Pew report from 2014. Black male children raised in households in the late 1970s and early 80s have fallen out of the middle class at particularly higher rates than white male children after becoming adults, another Pew report found. On shows like Donald Glover's Atlanta? on FX and Issa Rae's Insecure? on HBO, both about a group of professionally striving and financially struggling (and both, along with ? nominated for Golden Globes) the theme of black downward mobility is put into high relief. Comedy in the black community is almost always about struggle, said Mary Pattillo, author of Black Picket Fences: Privilege and Peril Among the Black Middle Class. And while exploring class differences is not new for black sitcoms, it is important that these themes are reproduced and restaged for each generation. The specifics might be different, but every generation returns to this theme because the precarity of the black middle class has not disappeared. On Atlanta, we meet Earn, a Princeton",-7.9469433

Ms. Holliday, in a letter she provided to The Wrap, an entertainment news website, said she would no longer take part in any events affiliated with the inauguration of Donald J. Trump as president. Her decision to withdraw, she said, was influenced by an article in The Daily Beast about how her planned appearance was heartbreaking to her gay fans. She also retweeted an piece in the Boston Globe describing Mr. Trump's cabinet nominees as a who's who of homophobia. I sincerely apologize for my lapse of judgment, for being uneducated on the issues that affect every American at this crucial time in history and for causing such dismay and heartbreak to my fans, she wrote. Please know that I HEAR YOU and I feel your pain, she added. The LGBT Community was mostly responsible for birthing my career and I am deeply indebted to you. You have loved me faithfully and unconditionally and for so many years you provided me with work even though my star had long since faded. Her spokesman, William Carpenter, confirmed the withdrawal. After she saw how hurt so many people were at the idea of her performing, she decided to pull out and not cause any extra anger or hurt, he said in an email. Ms. Holliday won a Tony Award in 1982 for her performance as Effie White in the original production of Dreamgirls, and she returned to Broadway this season as a replacement Shug Avery in a revival of The Color Purple. In an interview on Friday, she said that although she had voted for Hillary Clinton for president, she agreed to sing at a welcome concert on the National Mall the day before Mr. Trump's inauguration because she viewed it as a performance for the people, not the politician. She noted that she had performed at the invitation of Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, and viewed this invitation in that context. Nevertheless, her decision was greeted with a firestorm of opposition on social media from fans who argued that Mr. Trump is different from his Republican predecessors and that because of the nature of his rhetoric and his positions, she should not perform. On Saturday, she said she had found those arguments persuasive. I was honestly just thinking that I wanted my voice to be a healing and unifying force for hope through music to help our deeply polarized country, she wrote. Regretfully, I did not take into consideration that my performing for the concert would actually instead be taken as a political act against my own personal beliefs and be mistaken for support of Donald Trump and Mike Pence.

Trump is to be sworn in as president, she said yes. I'm singing on the mall for the people, she said. I don't have a dog in this fight I'm just a singer, and it's a welcome concert for the people on the mall. Ms. Holliday, speaking during a telephone interview Friday afternoon, said she had not supported Mr. Trump's candidacy I voted for Mrs. Clinton, and they knew that. But, she said, if someone wants me to sing a national anthem or something, we think about America, and we go. Ms. Holliday sounded certain about her choice, but her spokesman, William Carpenter, suggested in a subsequent email that the decision was not set in stone. I just spoke to her and she still hadn't made up her mind about doing the event, he wrote. Ms. Holliday is a Broadway icon, renowned for her performance as Effie in the original cast of Dreamgirls, and she returned to Broadway this season as a replacement Shug Avery in the revival of The Color Purple. The final performance of that show was Sunday, and the Clintons were in the audience. Ms. Holliday said she was asked on Wednesday if she would sing at the concert scheduled for Jan. 19, and she agreed, seeing the request as similar to those she received to sing at the White House during past Republican and Democratic presidencies. I just thought of the history part of it, and about singing on the mall where Marian Anderson paved the way for me to sing as a black American, she said, referring to a 1939 concert that Ms. Anderson, a popular singer, performed from the Lincoln Memorial after being denied permission to sing at Constitution Hall because she was black. Ms. Holliday said she had been startled and disheartened on Friday by the venom that greeted the news of her participation. It brought a lot of threats from people already saying I'll never work again, she said. If that's what America has come to, where we all hate and bully people, there's no more freedom of speech. She added, I know everybody hates me now, but that shows we are all just hateful people now we don't even want to work together. And, she said, If it's the end of everything for me, then it has to be the end of everything for me. I would hope that's not how it ends up, but right now I would like to be a part of a welcoming part of America.

48,16,What did Donald Trump concede for the first time during his news conference at Trump Tower?,1,17557,"Times reporters provided analysis and fact checks of Donald J. Trump's news conference. Donald J. Trump made an important concession about Russia. He criticized American intelligence officials. He sparred with reporters and denounced fake news. And that was all before he arrived at the ostensible reason for holding his first formal news conference since July: his plans to extricate himself from the operations of his vast business holdings. Here are the highlights from the whirling, hourlong news conference inside Trump Tower. Mr. Trump said that after his briefing on Friday with American intelligence officials, he now thought Russia was behind the effort to hack his election opponents. As far as hacking, I think it was Russia, Mr. Trump said. However, later in the news conference, Mr. Trump wavered slightly when pressed on the matter. But you know what, it could have been others also, he said when asked why he had been so critical of American intelligence officials. He harshly criticized the publication of unverified reports that claimed Russia has salacious information about his behavior and finances. I think it was disgraceful, disgraceful that the intelligence agencies let any information that turned out to be so false and fake out, he said. Explaining his Twitter post comparing the United States to Nazi Germany, he said of the leaks: That's something that Nazi Germany would have done and did do. Mr. Trump added that BuzzFeed, which published the memos in their entirety, is a failing pile of garbage? that would suffer the consequences for publishing the uncorroborated report. Mr. Trump said he was untroubled by other intelligence reports that have been made public, which said Russia preferred him over Hillary Clinton and that President Vladimir V. Putin ordered the election meddling to benefit him. If Putin likes Donald Trump, guess what, folks: That is called an asset, not a liability, he said. He added that a strong relationship could allow the two nations to work together on difficult international issues. When asked whether he had a message for Mr. Putin, Mr. Trump said: He shouldn't be doing it. He won't be doing it. Russia will have much greater respect for our country when I am leading it. He added: There's no reset button. We're either going to get along or we're not. But he did not address a question about whether he or anyone on his campaign staff had had contact with Russia during the campaign. Mr. Trump swatted away allegations included in the uncorroborated reports. He said that, when traveling, he warns his aides and bodyguards, Be very careful, because in your hotel rooms and no matter where you go, you're gonna probably have cameras. He also added, apparently referring to a detail in the report about supposed sex videos with prostitutes, I'm also very much of a germaphobe, believe me.

Trump's inaugural news conference as a duly elected United States in which he called BuzzFeed a failing pile of garbage, dismissed CNN as fake news? and more or less told the whole lot of reporters at Trump Tower to stuff it when it comes to his unreleased tax returns because everyday Americans don't care and, anyway, I won. There were two big lessons in the Wednesday morning melee. 1. Mr. Trump remains a master media manipulator who used his first news briefing since July to expertly delegitimize the news media and make it the story rather than the chaotic swirl of ethical questions that engulf his transition. 2. The news media remains an unwitting accomplice in its own diminishment as it fails to get a handle on how to cover this new and wholly unprecedented president. It better figure things out, fast, because it has found itself at the edge of the cliff. And our (fingers crossed) democracy needs it to stay on the right side of the drop. Journalists should know this by now: Trump's gonna Trump. But it's time for them to take a page from the playbook accept the things they cannot change and then find the courage to change the things they can, in the right ways, not the wrong ways. Given Mr. Trump's past behavior, there was hardly any doubt that he was going to kneecap his inquisitors on Wednesday. It's a passion, after all, if not a strategic imperative. But BuzzFeed handed him the steel rod hours before, with its decision to publish an unvarnished dossier filled with unsubstantiated, compromising reports about Mr. Trump allegedly collected by Russian agents, presumably for blackmail purposes. BuzzFeed said it was publishing the full document so that Americans can make up their own minds about allegations about the that have circulated at the highest levels of the U. S. government. Ben Smith, the BuzzFeed editor in chief, wrote that we have always erred on the side of publishing? and that publishing this dossier reflects how we see the job of reporters in 2017. Mr. Smith's stated rationale highlights the extent to which WikiLeaks and Gawker, which is now defunct, have changed the nature of journalism. Both have at times taken a publish first, fill in the answers or don't later? approach, but they held particular, outsider roles in the journalistic firmament. And both have run into great trouble because of their styles, in Gawker's case, fatally (if wrongfully). BuzzFeed, under Mr. Smith, has built up a fine traditional news team that has won journalism awards precisely because it succeeded in the ultimate purposes of its craft: to establish fact from fiction and enhance its readers? understanding of reality. That's the opposite of pumping out a bunch of unsubstantiated allegations and then leaving it to readers to make up their own minds? about them with no reportorial guidance.

Still, the S. N.

Saturday night's episode, the first new one of 2017, once again featured Alec Baldwin as Mr. Trump. He started off the faux news conference by vowing to answer what he said was the question that's on everyone's mind. Yes, this is real life, he said. This is really happening. On January 20, I, Donald J. Trump, will become the 45th president of the United States. He continued: And then, two months later, Mike Pence will become the 46th. Listing the performers who are scheduled for his inauguration, he cited the rock band 3 Doors Down, Jackie What? from America's Got Talent? and the one Rockette with the least money in her savings. (He also said the actors Angelina Jolie, Ryan Gosling and Jennifer Lawrence would be in attendance courtesy of Madame Tussauds. ) Turning to questions from reporters played by the S. N. L. cast, Mr. pointedly refused to answer questions about an alleged compromising videotape, because, he said, it didn't happen and it wasn't as cool as it sounded. Asked by a reporter played by Sasheer Zamata how he planned to repeal and replace Obamacare, Mr. Baldwin said, I actually do have a replacement plan, O. K.? I just read about it this week. It's a terrific plan. Just great. It's called the Affordable Care Act. When Ms. Zamata's character said that repealing Obamacare meant that people could die, Mr. Baldwin replied, Listen, sweetheart, I'm about to be president, we're all going to die.

American Airlines, Ms. Rivard's former employer, offers free miles to the volunteers of Airline Ambassadors International. American's employees already undergo training on human trafficking, led by the Department of Homeland Security, according to a company representative. Ms. Rivard said airlines? existing programs are not enough. She cited instances in which she said airline staff failed to take signs of trafficking seriously, and added that she wished more resources were available to her organization. It doesn't cost much. We try to raise about $3, 000 per training? from individual donors, she said. An Airline Ambassadors International training session in late January in Houston, just before the Super Bowl there, was filled to capacity. It was an amazing event, Ms. Hubbard said. I give kudos to the city of Houston and to the agencies that are doing the work on the ground. Though human trafficking gets more attention during major sporting events like the Super Bowl, there is little hard evidence from Polaris or elsewhere to suggest a major spike in trafficking during large events. We don't think it's useful to somehow give the impression that there are new victims and new types of trafficking that only happen around that time, Mr. Myles said, though he added that major events might lure criminals who were already operating in other areas. The Houston Police Department has been revamping its approach to human trafficking for years, said Capt. Dan Harris, of the department's vice division. It now offers training on human trafficking for officers as well as assistance for survivors. We had the processes, the procedures and the relationships already in place, Captain Harris said. The only thing we really did for the Super Bowl was work more hours in order to go after, mainly, the johns. While law enforcement agencies and charities work to address the problem on the ground, Ms. Hubbard and other flight attendants plan to keep an eye on things in the air. If someone is being held against their will, then a crime is being committed inside my airplane, she said. So it is my responsibility to make sure that these people whose lives are in my hands while they're on board my aircraft are safe.",-0.54563344
52,17,Who founded Airline Ambassadors International?,2,18382,"Donna Hubbard, a flight attendant who lives outside Atlanta, has no problem speaking forcefully about the issue of human trafficking in the United States. But her voice begins to falter when she talks about her own life how years of exploitation shattered her confidence and turned her life upside down. For many years, I couldn't talk about being an addict, she said. I couldn't talk about being imprisoned. I couldn't talk about getting on my feet, getting my life back, getting my children back. She paused to fight back tears. I could not talk about that part of me where I was victimized. But having realized that airline employees are perfectly positioned to stop human traffickers and their victims in transit, Ms. Hubbard has found her mission: teaching other flight attendants to spot and report cases of human trafficking. The nonprofit organization she joined in 2015, Airline Ambassadors International, trains workers at airlines and airports how to spot, and report, cases of human trafficking. It also delivers humanitarian aid around the world and transports sick children who need medical care. It was founded in 1996 by Nancy Rivard, who was then a flight attendant. We just did it on our own as a public service because we had the personnel, Ms. Rivard said, noting that the organization began focusing on human trafficking in 2009 and has held 52 training sessions in the United States and abroad since 2011. There were 8, 042 reported cases of human trafficking in the United States last year the most ever, according to a report released last week by the nonprofit organization Polaris. Most of those came through calls to the National Human Trafficking Hotline, which was established by the federal government in December 2007 and is operated by Polaris in a partnership. The number of reported cases has been rising every year since the hotline was established. But it is not all bad news, said Bradley Myles, Polaris's chief executive. We don't necessarily want to give the impression that just because we're learning about more cases, the crime is increasing, Mr. Myles said. It's actually possible that the response is getting more sophisticated. Encouragingly, he added, more and more of these reports are coming directly from trafficking victims, which suggests a growing awareness among those who need it most that the hotline exists. Ms. Hubbard sees victim outreach as vital to her work, but she is hesitant to give details about her own ordeal. She entered an arranged marriage at 16, she said, but the worst abuses did not start until her early 20s, when she described being bought and sold, traded and bartered.

Neumann, the president of the American Academy of Diplomacy, a nonprofit association for former ambassadors and senior diplomats, said it was reasonable to expect ambassadors to return at the end of a term, given that they are direct representatives of the president with broad grants of authority. But he could not recall an occasion on which such a strict timeline had been applied. When you have people out there whose only reason for being an ambassador is their political connection to the outgoing president of a different party, it's pretty logical to say they should leave, said Mr. Neumann, a career Foreign Service officer who held ambassadorships in Algeria, Bahrain and Afghanistan. But I don't recollect there was ever a guillotine in January where it was just, Everybody out of the pool immediately. ? W. Robert Pearson, a former ambassador to Turkey and a scholar at the Middle East Institute in Washington, said the rule was quite extraordinary, adding that it could undermine American interests and signal a hasty change in direction that exacerbates jitters among allies about their relationships with the new administration. With the world already primed to be worrying about such an abrupt change, this is just a very concrete signal that it is going to happen, Mr. Pearson said. At a White House farewell reception that Mr. Obama held on Wednesday night for noncareer ambassadors, many of them commiserated, attendees said, comparing notes about how to handle the situation. Some expressed dismay that Mr. Trump, whose wife, Melania, has chosen to stay in New York to avoid moving the couple's son, Barron, to a new school midyear, would not ensure that such allowances were made for American ambassadors. They are weighing a direct appeal to Rex W. Tillerson, Mr. Trump's nominee for secretary of state, or other top transition officials to reconsider the policy. Derek Shearer, a professor of diplomacy at Occidental College who is a former United States ambassador to Finland, said it was difficult to see a rationale for the decision. It feels like there's an element just of spite and payback in it, he said. I don't see a higher policy motive. The State Department informed all politically appointed ambassadors in a letter the day after the election that they were to submit letters of resignation effective Jan. 20. It instructed those who wanted to seek extensions to submit formal requests explaining their justifications. Incoming presidents of both parties have often made exceptions to allow ambassadors to wrap up personal affairs and important diplomatic business while their successors were in the confirmation process, which can take months. Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Mr. Obama all granted extensions for a few politically appointed ambassadors. Former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell offered particularly wide latitude to ambassadors facing family issues, said Marc Grossman, a longtime diplomat and former top State Department official who is vice chairman of the Cohen Group, a",-6.925435

The news agency said that a police raid on a residence in the outlying Esenyurt district of Istanbul had resulted in the capture of Abdulgadir Masharipov, whom the authorities described as an Islamic State militant of Uzbek nationality, along with four other people. The others were a man of Kyrgyz nationality and three women, whose nationalities were not given, Anadolu said. Turkish news organizations posted photographs of the suspect in custody, showing him bruised and with fresh blood on his clothing and face. He had reportedly been injured while carrying out the deadly attack on the Reina nightclub on the Bosporus. An estimated 69 people were wounded by the attacker, who went on a shooting rampage with a rifle inside the crowded and popular venue. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack the next day and said in a statement that it had been carried out in continuation of the blessed operations that the Islamic State is conducting against Turkey, the protector of the cross. The Turkish authorities quickly identified the suspect from television, and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan vowed to bring him to justice. Turkey's foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, posted a Twitter message congratulating the country's interior minister on the arrest. In the name of our nation, I thank primarily our minister, Suleyman Soylu, our police and intelligence organizations who captured Reina assailant, he wrote. The district where the suspect was captured, Esenyurt, on the European side of Istanbul, is a former slum that has been rapidly redeveloped with new apartment blocks housing many refugees and migrants. Turkish news reports said Mr. Masharipov was with his son when he was captured, and news video showed one of the suspects being attacked at the arrest scene.

55,18,Where was the suspect in the Istanbul nightclub attack arrested?,2,17314,"ISTANBUL The Islamic State on Monday issued a rare claim of responsibility for an attack in Turkey after a New Year's Day shooting at an Istanbul nightclub that killed at least 39 people, describing the gunman who carried out the assault and who has not been identified or captured as a hero soldier of the caliphate. The Turkish authorities are still searching for the gunman, who killed a police officer guarding the Reina nightclub before going on a shooting rampage with a rifle, but the state news media reported that eight suspects had been detained in connection with the attack. The authorities on Monday released two photographs of the person suspected of being the gunman, captured by security cameras, that showed a cleanshaven man in a dark winter coat. The government's spokesman, Numan Kurtulmus, said at a news conference that investigators believed they found the assailant's fingerprints and that they were close to identifying him. Mr. Kurtulmus did not mention the Islamic State specifically, but he said Turkey would press the fight against terrorism. Referring to the attack, which happened just after midnight on Sunday morning, Mr. Kurtulmus said: The fact that it was done during the first minutes of 2017 gives an important message. The message is, We will go on to menace Turkey in 2017.? And we say to them, we will break into your caves wherever you are. The Turkish newspaper Hurriyet reported on Monday that the gunman might be from Kyrgyzstan or elsewhere in Central Asia. The Russian news agency Interfax quoted Aiymkan Kulukeyeva, a spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry in Kyrgyzstan, as saying, According to preliminary information, this information is doubtful, but we are checking all the same. The Islamic State asserted in a statement that the attack had been carried out in continuation of the blessed operations that the Islamic State is conducting against Turkey, the protector of the cross. A hero soldier of the caliphate attacked one of the most famous nightclubs, where Christians celebrated their pagan holiday, read the statement from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. They used hand grenades and a machine gun and transformed their celebration to mourning. In an apparent reference to Turkey's role in the conflict in Syria, the statement warned that the government of Turkey should know that the blood of Muslims, which it is targeting with its planes and its guns, will cause a fire in its home by God's will. The statement did not name the assailant, and it was not clear whether the Islamic State had organized the attack or had merely inspired the gunman. But the shooting came just days after a State group, the Nashir Media Foundation, published the latest in a series of messages calling for attacks on clubs, markets and movie theaters. The Islamic State's claim of responsibility came after years of complex relations between the Turkish state and the jihadist group operating across its southern border.

56,18,Where was the suspect in the Istanbul nightclub attack arrested?,3,18316,"ISTANBUL Several hundred people suspected of being Islamic State operatives were arrested in a series of coordinated raids by the Turkish police on Sunday, in what constitutes one of Turkey's largest operations against the jihadist group on the country's soil. Nearly 450 suspects were rounded up in the early hours of Sunday, according to the Anadolu Agency, a news wire. Independent television reports later said 690 suspects had been held by the end of the day. At least one attack was said to have been thwarted in the process, according to Anadolu. The operation was distinct from crackdowns on those accused of being supporters of last summer's failed coup, and on members of the country's political opposition. More than 130, 000 Turks have been arrested or fired from government posts in the past seven months as part of those efforts, according to government data. Sunday's raids were the latest salvo in a conflict between Turkey and the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. In the early years of the Syrian revolution, Turkey was accused of turning a blind eye to the movement of thousands of Islamic State fighters over its southern border with Syria, where they joined the war against the forces of the Syrian president, Bashar . But the Turkish Army is now in direct conflict with the group in northern Syria, where Turkey is leading attempts to expel the Islamic State from the strategically important city of Al Bab. Turkey has suffered numerous attacks linked to the Islamic State since 2014, most recently in the early hours of this year, when a fighter killed 39 people at a nightclub in Istanbul, Turkey's largest city. The group is also believed to be behind an October 2015 bombing in Ankara, Turkey's capital, that killed more than 100 people, and was accused of organizing the killing of 45 people at Istanbul's main airport last summer. This weekend's raids occurred across an unusually wide area, with suspects seized in 18 provinces. The move is a change in strategy by the Turkish police, who have usually detained only small numbers of jihadists at a time, said Sinan Ulgen, a former Turkish diplomat, and an analyst who focuses on Turkey for Carnegie Europe, a think tank. But the detentions may not necessarily lead to court cases. Over all, Turkey's efforts to combat the influence and network of the Islamic State at home is still handicapped by discrepancies between the different arms of the Turkish state, Mr. Ulgen said. An effort led by law enforcement is sometimes handicapped by the decisions of the Turkish judiciary, which as we have seen in the recent past has let go people associated with the Islamic State. Ahmet Yayla, a former counterterrorism chief in Turkey and a critic of the Turkish government, also questioned the effectiveness of such a large raid, which he argued could overwhelm the capacity of the counterterrorism police.

57,19,"What significant event involving Emmett Till occurred on August 28, 1955?",1,18084,"THE BLOOD OF EMMETT TILLBy Timothy B. Tyson291 pp. Simon Schuster. $27. The existence of racial terror is not a singular phenomenon in our country's national archive. Consider 2015, a feverish June night in South Carolina, when Dylann Roof, feeding off racist conspiracy theories, walked into Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church and murdered nine black parishioners. Then reach back almost 20 years before that, to 1998, when James Byrd Jr. a black man, was abducted by three white men and fatally dragged from the back of a pickup truck along unforgiving Texas asphalt. Then there is perhaps the most monstrous application of racial terror in our historical register: Aug. 28, 1955, when Emmett Till was lynched. The events of that bitter morning, their motivations and ramifications, have found a meticulous, if not their most exhaustive, retelling in Timothy B. Tyson's The Blood of Emmett Till, an account of absorbing and sometimes horrific detail. Comprehensive in scope, its final 60 pages alone are a catalog of notes and sources. Tyson is a senior research scholar at Duke University and the author of Blood Done Sign My Name, about the 1970 lynching of Henry Marrow in Tyson's hometown, and he tracks Till's life from Argo, Ill. to Chicago, to his last moments in Money, Miss. where despite the hesitation of his mother, Mamie Till had sojourned with relatives. On a Wednesday evening in August, Till allegedly flirted with and grabbed the hand of Carolyn Bryant, a white woman who worked as the cashier at a local market. According to recovered court transcripts released by the F. B. I. in 2007, he let out a wolf whistle? as she exited the store to get a gun from her car. Bryant later informed her husband and his half brother, who proceeded to uphold a grim tradition: Till was abducted, beaten, shot in the head and thrown into the Tallahatchie River. A gin fan was tied to his neck with barbed wire, with the hope that he would never be found. Black life in America has endured as little more than a fragile truth in the hands of white aggressors. And Tyson does well to remind us just how racial terror can be when wielded with brute force: Affronted white supremacy drove every blow. There are a number of facts to parse in this book such as Till's affinity for straw hats on churchgoing Sundays, and the sheriff's belief that the body recovered from the river was part of an N. A. A. C. P. scheme? to disgrace Mississippi but none perhaps more profoundly consequential than Bryant's own admission to Tyson that the events that led to Till's death didn't happen as she had previously attested.

In 2008, in her only interview since that fateful season of death, Bryant admitted to Tyson that a crucial piece of her testimony in court was fabricated. Till never grabbed her around the waist and uttered obscenities, as she had avowed on the witness stand. You tell these stories for so long that they seem true, she confesses early in the book, but that part is not true. And so we are left with a sobering certainty, one that even Bryant herself is forced to concede to Tyson, more than 50 years later: Nothing that boy did could ever justify what happened to him. The sum of history is made up of recurring patterns. Each new decade has brought past sins to the fore. From Emmett Till and Henry Marrow to Amadou Diallo, Rekia Boyd and Alton Sterling. These deaths, lynchings that have taken new shapes, are simply the mores and modes of a American custom: white supremacy.

Tillerson, the former chairman and chief executive of Exxon Mobil, was confirmed by the Senate on Wednesday in a vote to become the nation's 69th secretary of state just as serious strains have emerged with important international allies. The votes against Mr. Tillerson's confirmation were the most in Senate history for a secretary of state, a reflection of Democratic unease with President Trump's early foreign policy pronouncements that threaten to upend a multilateral approach that has guided United States presidents since World War II. Thirteen senators voted in 2005 against Condoleezza Rice in the midst of a deteriorating Iraq war, and in 1825, Henry Clay was confirmed 27 to 14, the record for votes against until Wednesday, according to a tally provided by the Senate Historical Office. In a brief ceremony in the Oval Office on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump said Mr. Tillerson understood the importance of strengthening our alliances and forming new alliances to enhance our strategic interests and the safety of our people. Mr. Trump added, It's time to bring a focus on foreign affairs, to take a fresh look at the world around us, and to seek new solutions grounded in very ancient truths. Mr. Tillerson thanked him and promised to represent the interests of all of the American people at all times. Mr. Tillerson is expected to appear at the State Department's Foggy Bottom headquarters on Thursday morning, when he will address department employees. Mr. Trump's unapologetically nationalistic approach has put into question the value of many alliances and multilateral institutions. How Mr. Tillerson's translates Mr. Trump's vow of America First? into the kind of polite diplomatic parlance that will maintain vital ties will be a significant test. Among his other challenges are dealing with Mr. Trump's promises to recast relations with China and Russia, move the American Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, and an international nuclear deal with Iran. In a White House briefing on Wednesday, Michael Flynn, the national security adviser, issued a stern warning to Iran. The Obama administration failed to respond adequately to Tehran's malign actions, he said. Mr. Tillerson, 64, a Texan, earned an engineering degree from the University of Texas at Austin, got a job at Exxon in 1975 and climbed his way to the top, leaving only last year. Neither a diplomat, soldier nor politician, he is an unconventional choice for the job, but has vast international experience. With operations on six continents, Exxon Mobil is in some ways a state within a state. As its chief executive, Mr. Tillerson struck deals with repressive governments in at least one case, against the advice of the State Department. Environmentalists largely opposed his nomination. But his views on international affairs are in many ways more conventional than those of Mr. Trump, which is why even foreign affairs experts said they welcomed his selection in hopes he would bring ballast to a turbulent administration.

Their castoff scraps can be worth money, not to mention the obsessive attentions of future scholars. Jonathan Lethem, 52, recently became the latest author to sell his personal paper trail to a major archive. The Beinecke Rare Book Manuscript Library at Yale University acquired a trove of his manuscripts, letters, notes and other artifacts, which will now sit alongside material from Walt Whitman, Sinclair Lewis, James Baldwin and Marilynne Robinson in its rich American literature collection. Mr. Lethem's papers contain items relating to the novels that made him something of a reluctant patron saint of Brooklyn's literary ascendance, including Motherless Brooklyn? (1999) and The Fortress of Solitude? (2003). But as befits a lifelong collector, music obsessive, comics geek and dedicated chronicler of underground culture, there are also cartoons, New York 1970s ephemera and what is surely the largest cache of drawings of vomiting cats in any university collection. For an author who is so much fun as a novelist, it's interesting to see there is so much fun in his archival documents as well, said Melissa Barton, the curator of American prose and drama at the Beinecke. (Ms. Barton, citing library policy, declined to say what Yale paid in the sale, which was arranged by the Manhattan book dealer Glenn Horowitz.) Mr. Lethem's archive also includes two computer hard drives, a laptop and other digital materials, especially from more recent years. You can feel the evaporation of the physical ephemera, Mr. Lethem, whose most recent novel, A Gambler's Anatomy, appeared in October, said in an interview. But the bulk of the collection consists of artifacts, some of them charmingly weird. We asked Mr. Lethem, who left New York in 2010 to teach creative writing at Pomona College in Claremont, Calif. about some of the odder items in his literary closet. The archive includes a number of comic books Mr. Lethem made as a child, featuring invented superheroes like Man, whose origin story included an attempt to start a nudist colony in Alaska. In one installment, Man (who later got a passing in The Fortress of Solitude?) battled Ed Koch, who was no hero to Mr. Lethem's bohemian parents. I didn't make multiple copies to sell or anything, he said. It was more like I was collecting my own weird artifacts from a pretend universe where Man was a real comic. Mr. Lethem swiped this sticker after stumbling on a shoot for the 1979 movie The Warriors? in the subway station in Brooklyn, which was standing in for the Times Square station. This was my subway stop, and the fact that they were turning it into 42nd Street seemed absurd, Mr. Lethem recalled. I remember thinking that no one would see or hear about this movie. Nothing that anyone was shooting in my neighborhood could possibly be important. The archive contains typescripts of his novels, often affixed with alternate titles.

And indeed that is where they will go, through a partnership announced Tuesday with Monmouth University in West Long Branch, N. J. As part of the partnership, the university will establish the Bruce Springsteen Archives and Center for American Music, which will be the repository for Mr. Springsteen's personal collection of written works, photographs, periodicals and various artifacts from throughout his career. The university just miles from Asbury Park, one of the towns where Mr. Springsteen started his musical career said in a statement that the new center would promote the legacy of Mr. Springsteen and other giants of American music, like Woody Guthrie and Robert Johnson. Its materials would also bolster curriculums at the university, including at its music business program. The establishment of the Bruce Springsteen Archives and Center for American Music celebrates and reinforces the Jersey Shore's legacy in the history of American music, while providing a truly transformative experience for our students, Paul R. Brown, the university's president, said in a statement. The university offered few other details about the collection or its plans for the new center, including any financial information about the partnership. But Mr. Springsteen's materials will join what is already a major trove of memorabilia at Monmouth, the Bruce Springsteen Special Collection. That collection includes nearly 35, 000 items compiled in part by fans which has been housed at Monmouth since 2011. One of the figures involved in bringing the archives to Monmouth University was Robert Santelli, the executive director of the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles, who is expected to take on a leadership role at the new center. Mr. Santelli, a Monmouth alumnus, also helped secure the special collection for the university in 2011. The arrangement with Monmouth comes as archives have become increasingly valuable to museums, universities and other cultural institutions, which use them for scholarly study and sometimes as tourist attractions.

Trump supporter and editor at Breitbart News has compared Islam to cancer, mocked transgender people and suggested that women who are harassed online should stay off the web. Last July, he was permanently barred from Twitter for violating the platform's rules against hate speech and harassment. So when Threshold Editions, a conservative imprint at Simon Schuster, gave him a publishing contract, the blowback was swift and furious. There were calls for a boycott of all of the company's books, a vast catalog of some 2, 000 titles from 50 imprints. Some of Simon Schuster's authors including Karen Hunter, Danielle Henderson and Bradley Trevor Greive denounced the publisher on social media. The Chicago Review of Books said it would not review any of the company's books this year. The criticism highlights the minefield that publishers face as they try to court an emerging market of young conservatives who identify with extreme stances on issues like immigration and gender equality positions embodied with devious, irreverent glee by Mr. Yiannopoulos that they feel are undermining the nation. Many liberals and moderates say, however, those positions amount to outright racism and misogyny. And the issue has cast an uncomfortable spotlight on a lucrative but often overlooked niche within the largely publishing world. Every major publishing house has a conservative imprint Penguin Random House has two, Sentinel and Crown Forum and maintains a stable of authors who may not attend literary festivals or mingle at the National Book Awards but command a sizable audience in red state America. Most mainstream publishers try to claim partisan neutrality and publish books across the political spectrum. (Simon Schuster, for example, published Hillary Clinton's memoir and campaign book, as well as Mr. Trump's Crippled America. ) But occasionally, publishers get dragged into a political scrum. This past weekend, Broadside Books, a conservative imprint at HarperCollins, became embroiled in a controversy involving a CNN investigation that found that one of Broadside's authors, the conservative radio host and columnist Monica Crowley, had plagiarized numerous passages in her 2012 best seller, What the (Bleep) Just Happened. Ms. Crowley was recently selected by Mr. Trump to serve in a senior communications role at the National Security Council. In defending Ms. Crowley, the Trump transition team called the plagiarism charges a politically motivated attack, and described HarperCollins as one of the largest and most respected publishers in the world, invoking the company's stature and reputation as way to lend credibility to the author. But on Tuesday, HarperCollins announced it was withdrawing the digital edition of the book until Ms. Crowley revises it with proper attribution, placing the publishing house in the awkward position of being at odds with the incoming administration. Conservative books have been a blockbuster category for publishers for decades, dating to the rise of radio and cable in the 1980s.

That is his catchy voice on tastier sections of Who Loves You? and December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night), both revived in the smash Broadway musical Jersey Boys. Mr. Ciccone also led The Critters in the 1960s, with hits like Younger Girl? and Mr. Dieingly Sad, and was a musical director and bassist for Tommy James and the Shondells in the 90s. An obscure footnote to his extensive recording career was an unreleased batch of songs he recorded in the early 1970s with his longtime friend Brian Gari, 64, a who lives on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Mr. Gari wrote the songs and backed Mr. Ciccone on piano on recordings they made as demos to interest record labels. Of 20 selections, several were produced and released as complete songs, but even on the remaining sparse tracks, Mr. Ciccone's vocals shone. Don had that kind voice and we always liked the tapes, said Mr. Gari, who hung on to those old demo tapes for the next 45 years. He and Mr. Ciccone would occasionally prod each other to dust them off and release them as a Ciccone Sings Gari? album. In early October, Mr. Ciccone contacted Mr. Gari and said he planned to finally do just that, but a week later Mr. Ciccone died of a heart attack at age 70. The week before he died, Don told me he wanted to put out the demos, Mr. Gari recalled. He said, My next project is Ciccone sings Gari. ? Mr. Gari said he decided to realize Mr. Ciccone's last wish, and, on a recent weekday, he was in a music studio near Union Square working with a sound engineer, Peter Millrose, to give Mr. Ciccone's remarkable vocals on the old tapes a proper setting. One number called, I Just Had to Say My Last Goodbye? had the jaunty, melodic feel of Todd Rundgren, or the band Chicago in the 1970s. Working from Mr. Gari's stylistic cues, Mr. Millrose layered piano, bass and drums, and then toyed with horns, strings and other effects to punctuate Mr. Ciccone's phrasings. As Mr. Gari suggested various riffs or motifs, Mr. Millrose played them on a keyboard and added them to the digital recording until the spare track had become a slick, sturdy, fully orchestrated song. Mr. Millrose worked from sheet music of lyrics and chords written by a teenage Mr. Gari with help from his mother, who unlike Mr. Gari, had the musical training to write the melodies on music paper.

The two recorded the song in Mr. Gari's apartment and used the bathroom shower for rainfall sound effects, along with Mr. Ciccone making sounds of thunder. Mr. Gari called the project bittersweet, bringing him both the joy of hearing Mr. Ciccone's youthful voice again, but also a twinge of sadness that he was not around to participate and enjoy the results. It had been my dream to do this album, but I never thought it would happen after he died, said Mr. Gari, who kept the tapes among a large trove of materials he has amassed in the sprawling, apartment on West End Avenue where he has lived for more than 50 years while writing almost 1, 000 songs, several books and the music and lyrics for Late Nite Comic, which had a brief Broadway run in 1987. Mr. Gari has been married twice and held both his weddings in the apartment, which is full of memorabilia, including a vast archive of Upper West Side photos and film clips he has shot since he was in elementary school. One room is packed with items from Mr. Gari's maternal grandfather, Eddie Cantor, the movie and radio star. Shortly before his death, Mr. Cantor wrote a letter to the Brian, praising his creativity and anointing him as the one to carry on the tradition of show business in the family. Mr. Gari immediately began writing songs and riding the bus around Manhattan, selling his songs to music publishers. He enjoyed watching Mr. Ciccone perform with The Critters on an afternoon dance show hosted by John Zacherle, known as The Cool Ghoul. Mr. Gari wrote an adoring fan letter to Mr. Ciccone in 1966. Mr. Ciccone wrote back and their ensuing correspondence led to a friendship. By 1971, Mr. Gari was a struggling songwriter and Mr. Ciccone was looking for his next recording contract. Mr. Gari would play him the catchy teenage love songs he had written with melodies that he described as in the sunshine pop? vein. Of the 20 songs they recorded, several were made into fully produced songs, including Bicycle Ride, and Silent Celebration, which were issued by the Metromedia label on a 45 r. p. m. record. They recorded through 1973, when Mr. Ciccone joined the Four Seasons for a tenure that lasted through 1981. One of his Four Seasons bandmates from the era, Lee Shapiro, will produce one of the songs, Mr. Gari said. Mr. Gari said he hoped to release a CD of the 20 songs, several of which will include guitar work by his friend Dean Bailin, who played the memorable guitar fills on the 1979 hit Escape (The Pi'a Colada Song).

The only thing missing? The queen, who, in keeping with past practice on the anniversary itself, planned to observe the day privately, with a quiet reflective commemoration at her estate in Sandringham, in eastern England. Grander celebrations are in the works for the platinum jubilee in 2022. Royal jubilees commemorate the life and reign of monarchs. Elizabeth, 90, the world's monarch, is the first British sovereign to hold a sapphire jubilee. The events were relatively muted compared to the silver (25 years) gold (50 years) and diamond (60 years) jubilees, which were celebrated with festivities across Britain. There was a ruby jubilee to mark Elizabeth's 40 years as queen, but that anniversary was also . Few British monarchs have reached the milestone. King George III and Queen Victoria marked their golden jubilees with huge celebrations. Elizabeth was expected to spend the anniversary at Sandringham, and there will be no broader celebrations in coming days, as there had been for previous jubilees. She was apparently in good spirits? at a church service on Sunday, local news outlets reported. There have been concerns about the queen's health ever since she missed church services on Christmas Day and on New Year's Day because of what Buckingham Palace described as a heavy cold. Those absences were the first time in about 30 years that she had missed a holiday service. The queen made her first public appearance this year on Jan. 8, after a month's absence. She celebrated her diamond jubilee, in 2012, with a series of events, including a floating pageant on the River Thames and a tour across Britain. A traditional royal salute was held at Green Park in London. That was followed by a salute at the Tower of London. A 2014 portrait of the queen, taken by the British photographer David Bailey, wearing sapphire jewelry given to her by her father, King George VI, as a wedding gift in 1947, was published as part of the commemoration. The Royal Mail issued a stamp worth 5 pounds, or about $6. 25, to mark her accession to the throne, and ranges of special jubilee coins have been cast by the Royal Mint to mark the occasion, with one worth about 50, 000. Prime Minister Theresa May congratulated the queen on behalf of the nation, calling her an inspiration. It is a testament to her selfless devotion to the nation that she is not marking becoming the first monarch to reign for 65 years with any special celebration, but instead getting on with the job to which she has dedicated her life, Mrs. May said in a statement.",8.169042

Queen Elizabeth II's sapphire jubilee, marking 65 years on the British throne, brought new coins, a stamp and gun salutes. The only thing missing? The queen, 90, who spent a private and reflective day. The Berlin International Film Festival opens this week with a tale of survival, that of one of the 20th century's greatest jazz guitarists: Django Reinhardt. He was born in Belgium in 1910 to a Roma family that earned a living playing music from town to town. Reinhardt started off playing the banjo in Paris dance halls. At 18, he lost the use of two fingers on his left hand in a fire, and adapted with a new technique. He rose to fame in the 30s. But with World War II and the Nazi occupation of France, Reinhardt tried to flee, fearing that, as a Roma and a jazz musician, he would be detained and killed. Instead, his fame and the popularity of an officially discredited art form may have saved him. The Germans used Paris as the base for soldiers to rest and relax, said Michael Dregni, a Reinhardt biographer. Jazz was the hot music of the time, so they all want to go out and see Jazz, and Django was the biggest star in Europe. Reinhardt lived through the war, dying of a sudden stroke in 1953. His legacy lives on in the genre he helped create: Gypsy jazz. Patrick Boehler contributed reporting. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings. What would you like to see here?

The Doctor who isn't referred to as Doctor Who is a Time Lord from a distant planet who explores the universe in a time machine called the Tardis (which stands for Time and Relative Dimension in Space). A plucky human companion usually accompanies the Doctor, who faces a rotating cast of alien adversaries.

The show is a national institution in Britain and a cult favorite elsewhere in the world, with more than 800 episodes (a Guinness world record). The Doctor is capable of regenerating, a concept that was introduced to prolong the series when its first lead actor, William Hartnell, left amid failing health.

A. , a dour march of national pride. In total, the concert's message was that America is a defined geographical and ideological space, with borders worth defending, even at the price of excluding those who could make the place immeasurably more fun. This concert ended up being as notable for who did not show up as for who did. The only featured nonwhite performers were Sam Moore (of the 1960s soul duo Sam Dave) who sang a restrained America the Beautiful? backed by an choir, and DJ Ravidrums, who delivered his dim, caffeinated percussive interstitials from inside a spherical drum kit. But both of those acts got just a couple of minutes. The United States Army Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps got much more time for their songs. When Mr. Trump first appeared onstage at the show, accompanied by his wife, Melania, it was to the Rolling Stones's Heart of Stone, a song about a man who can't be swayed. At the end of the concert, Mr. Trump addressed the crowd briefly, thanked the performers, and suggested that hosting this event in front of the Lincoln Memorial might have been an unprecedented choice. That was not true. In 2009, Mr. Obama held a concert here, We Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial. It included athletes, actors and musicians from across genres Mary J.

Two friends, Kim Shourds and Susan Perkins Lovelady, drove in from Norfolk, Va. to attend the evening's concerts. They danced and sang along to God Blessed Texas, but as they took a break, they said the volatile political climate wasn't far from their minds. This is a celebration of America, Ms. Perkins Lovelady, 53, said. After all of the negativity of the past year, all of the positivity is a good thing. It's a heartsore country. Kenny and Katherine Dunham decided to make the drive from Kinston, N. C. after hearing that Representative John Lewis of Georgia would boycott Mr. Trump's inauguration. The Dunhams were not fazed by the lack of entertainers. I think if they don't want to perform, they shouldn't perform, Mr. Dunham, 60, said. But at the same time, my understanding is they weren't asked to. Toby Keith is going to perform. Lee Greenwood is going to perform. Some of the loudest cheers of the evening were for Jon Voight, the only Hollywood actor to lend his name to the event, as he spoke to the crowd about the barrage of propaganda? that Mr. Trump had faced in his race to the presidency. He certainly didn't need this job, Mr. Voight said of Mr. Trump. And yes, God answered all of our prayers. Mr. Voight then introduced Sam Moore, one half of the duo Sam Dave, who performed a soulful rendition of America the Beautiful. Mr. Trump made his first appearance about an hour into the show called the Make America Great Again! Welcome Celebration? when he walked down the steps of the Lincoln Memorial with his wife, Melania.

72,24,Who challenged Germany's national atonement for the Holocaust and Nazi crimes during a speech in Dresden?,1,17765,"DRESDEN, Germany At a beer hall on Tuesday evening, the lean blond man's voice boomed out over a crowd of hundreds some and but with a contingent of polished young professionals. The AfD is the last revolutionary, the last peaceful chance for our fatherland, declared the man, Bj'rn H'cke, referring to the political party Alternative for Germany, and employing a reverential term for Germany, one of several nationalist buzzwords usually shunned in the country's politics. Jawohl!? a few shouted. Yes!? When Mr. H'cke (pronounced ) lamented that German history is handled as rotten and made to look ridiculous? a subtle but clear reference to guilt for the Holocaust and other Nazi war crimes the crowd responded by chanting, Deutschland, Deutschland. His speech at the rally in Dresden on Tuesday touched off a wave of national alarm by challenging Germany's national atonement for the Holocaust and for its Nazi crimes. His comments drew broad criticism for their venom and because Mr. H'cke, a rising star in the AfD, has found growing success with his messages of extreme nationalism. Shouting to be heard over cheering supporters, many of whom stood, Mr. H'cke challenged the collective national guilt over the war that has restrained German politics for three generations. At times he used language that seemed to hint at lamenting Nazi Germany's defeat. Germans were the only people in the world to plant a monument of shame in the heart of its capital, he said, referring to a memorial to murdered Jews in Berlin. He added that Germans had the mentality of a totally vanquished people. Mr. H'cke, who began his speech by triumphantly raising his arms over his head, represents the rightward flank of Alternative for Germany, an already party. But his speech and the crowd's energetic reception of his words offer a glimpse of the relatively new party's threat to German politics. He is on the fringe, but that fringe is growing in numbers and in willingness to defy the usual restraints, to the rising alarm of Germany's establishment leaders, who on Wednesday denounced his comments. Sigmar Gabriel, leader of the Social Democrats and the country's vice chancellor, shot back in a Facebook post showing a banner splashed across an image of Mr. H'cke standing at a lectern, reading: To remember the millions of victims of the Nazis is no weakness. Baiting the helpless to promote yourself is weakness. The chairman of the Green Party for the state of Saxony, Jrgen Kasek, on Twitter called for the speech to be checked for possible violations of laws. He accused Mr. H'cke of saying things that violated the spirit of the Constitution in the style of national socialism. The Central Council of Jews in Germany, in a statement, called the comments deeply deplorable and fully unacceptable. Charlotte Knobloch, a former president of the council, told the newspaper Stimme Heilbronner that Mr. H'cke's speech was unbearable agitation, and she warned that the AfD is poisoning the political culture and social debate in Germany.

Charlotte Knobloch, a former president of the council, told the newspaper Stimme Heilbronner that Mr. H'cke's speech was unbearable agitation, and she warned that the AfD is poisoning the political culture and social debate in Germany. Mr. H'cke's comments even drew a rebuke from the chairwoman of Alternative for Germany, Frauke Petry, who said they were out of line and straining? the party. Ms. Petry and Mr. H'cke have been locked in a power struggle for months over how far to the right to position the party, which was originally founded on an platform. The party is polling at nearly 15 percent, ahead of some mainstream parties, for this fall's national election. Its rapid rise demonstrates that German nationalist politics can find a foothold in unexpected places, for example among educated young people like those at Tuesday's rally. Those many in coat and tie, looked and primly trendy. Most of the men wore their hair buzzed close on the sides and long and floppy on top, separated by a severe side parting that seemed unmistakably evocative of Hitler's. Mainstream parties in Germany have long eschewed politics in the style of movements and have avoided shows of overt nationalism. But that leaves an opening: A populist party like Alternative for Germany can indulge those ideas just enough to excite its supporters without scaring off larger groups of voters. The Alternative for Germany supporters who were gathered in Dresden, the capital of Saxony, seemed animated in a way that is unusual when it comes to modern politics in Germany. Most Germans rarely feel allowed to get excited about their political beliefs or, just as sensitive an issue, about their national identity. The atmosphere lent the evening a feeling of thrilling transgression, as if the act of cheering ideas was as important, or perhaps more so, than the ideas themselves. Julian M. W'lder, a law student, said he had initially joined the youth league of the Christian Democratic Union, the party to which Chancellor Angela Merkel belongs. But the party did not feel like real politics, he said. Alternative for Germany, Mr. W'lder said, finally felt genuine. This is a core part of the party's message: While other parties are all the same, only Alternative for Germany really expresses the popular will. Mr. W'lder and other young attendees seemed tense the location of the gathering was kept secret until that morning in a failed attempt to avoid the protesters who often gather outside the semiregular rallies but they were jovial. The rally on Tuesday felt, if not like a watershed, then a glimpse of a wider, more gradual change.

And that taboo is precisely the point. Only the fringes would be brazen enough to champion a nationalist identity. But that risks letting those fringes define its contours. Mr. H'cke, for instance, disavowed a famous 1985 speech by Richard von Weizsacker, then the president of Germany, that called for the Allied victory to be seen as the liberation of the German people, not as their defeat. Mr. H'cke called Mr. Weizsacker's address a speech against his own people, and not for his own people. Since 2015, when Germany received nearly a million asylum seekers, Alternative for Germany has sought to portray national identity as under threat from migration and multiculturalism. Establishment parties and other enemies, Mr. H'cke told the crowd, are liquidating our beloved German fatherland, like a piece of soap under warm running water. But we, we beloved friends, we patriots, we will close this open tap, and we will win back our Germany, piece by piece. Yascha Mounk, a lecturer at Harvard and a fellow at the Transatlantic Academy of the German Marshall Fund, said Germany had a style of government that could leave an especially wide opening for fringe parties. Because the German parties tend to govern in a grand, coalition, voters often see little change when parties shift in and out. Politics in Germany usually play out in quiet, polite negotiations among members of the coalition, rather than in dramatic, public clashes between competing parties. The coalition blocks fringe parties like Alternative for Germany, which can then paint mainstream politics as an elite conspiracy to impose unpopular policies and to shut down real debate. The crowd, at one point, chanted a line Mr. W'lder has also used: We are the outsiders. It was a jarring moment, as many of the outsiders? were young, white and wore suits and ties seemingly the definition of an insider in Germany. Because these young Germans say that the political establishment has denied them sufficient pride in their national identity, they feel as if they are being oppressed, even though they have every right and live in a country that has one of Europe's economies. But young and old supporters of Alternative for Germany seemed to find something at Tuesday's rally that is not common among politics: a sense of impending victory. Not in the sense that they would oust Ms. Merkel's government this fall she is likely to retain power but in the belief that their movement would quickly shape and perhaps one day overcome a system that they see as denying them their German pride. Mr. Mounk said that the rise of extremist voices may have been inevitable, given the failure of mainstream parties to satisfy the desires for national and for charismatic politics. That left an opening for Mr. H'cke to deliver a message beyond the usual gripes about being too ashamed of",-3.4063966

C. had subsided when the phone rang on Monday. The caller, an woman, in a loud screaming voice kept saying there's a bomb, said Barry A. Abels, the center's executive director. At roughly the same time, a woman dialed the Jewish community center in Rockville, Md. nearly 500 miles away, and said there was a bomb. Not long after, a man called a Jewish organization in Wilmington, Del. He, too, warned of a bomb. Similar threats, which turned out to be unfounded, were reported all over the Eastern United States on Monday, at as many as 16 Jewish community facilities, one advocacy group estimated. Time and time again, the police responded, buildings were evacuated and, after tense waits, the centers and schools reopened. Federal law enforcement officials did not definitively link the threats, but the episodes rattled nerves, and raised deep concern and little doubt that the phone calls had been orchestrated. My personal take is it's a statement of where we are in this country, said Michael Feinstein, the chief executive of the Bender Jewish Community Center of Greater Washington, in Rockville. There's some thought amongst some people that hate speech and hate crimes are O. K. and is O. K. and I think that is reflective of sort of the political discourse that we've had in this country. Mr. Feinstein said about 300 people had been in the Rockville center when the threat was made, including about 200 preschoolers. After the threat in Delaware, parents were called to pick up preschool and day school students. In South Carolina, Mr. Abels said staff members and patrons attending exercise classes had to leave. About three hours later, he said, the authorities said it was safe to return, leaving many to wonder what had happened. It could be anything from hate groups to a terrorist situation, Mr. Abels said. I think it's probably more on the hate group side, because it was just a scare. He said he believed it was designed to be psychologically disorienting and scary and just disruptive. Jerry Silverman, the president and chief executive of the Jewish Federations of North America, said the threats were part of a disturbing trend toward normalizing hate speech.

It is evident that Israel is exploiting the inauguration of the new American administration to escalate its violations and the prevention of any existence of a Palestinian state, she added, calling on the United States and other international players to take concrete measures against Israeli settlement activities. Israel's campaign of settlement construction has brought widespread criticism. A month ago, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution condemning Israel's settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem as having no legal validity and constituting a flagrant violation under international law? after the Obama administration decided not to veto the measure. Days later, the departing secretary of state, John Kerry, rebuked Israel's settlement activities in an impassioned speech, saying, The status quo is leading toward one state and perpetual occupation. But with Israel's occupation of the West Bank in its 50th year, the Israeli government, dominated by and religious parties, is clearly expecting a friendlier approach from the White House after years of tension with the Obama administration. David M. Friedman, the bankruptcy lawyer President Trump has nominated as his ambassador to Israel, has led a arm of the settlement movement and has dismissed the idea of a Palestinian state alongside Israel. He has declared that he intends to work in Jerusalem, not Tel Aviv, where the American Embassy has been for decades, under the State Department's insistence that the holy city's status be determined as part of a broader deal between Israel and the Palestinians. It was not immediately clear whether the Israeli announcement had been coordinated in advance with Mr. Trump's team. But beyond Mr. Netanyahu's apparent attempt to chart a new course with Mr. Trump, he is also under intense pressure from the right flank of his governing coalition to demonstrate where his domestic loyalties lie. Naftali Bennett, the education minister and leader of the staunchly Jewish Home party, has been goading the prime minister to seize the moment and take the extreme step of beginning a process of annexing the West Bank settlements to Israel. Netanyahu is facing a historic decision: sovereignty or Palestine, Mr. Bennett said on Monday. We urge Netanyahu, don't miss an opportunity that comes along once every 50 years. Mr. Netanyahu appeared to postpone any discussion of annexation: This is no time for decisions or political dictations, and this is no time for surprises. This, he added, is the time for considered, responsible diplomacy among friends. The prime minister's office said that in a phone conversation with Mr. Trump on Sunday, Mr. Netanyahu discussed the peace process and hoped to forge a common vision? with Mr. Trump to advance peace and security in the region, with no daylight between the United States and Israel.

78,26,What significant event in Tom Casperson's political career was influenced by the DeVos family's opposition?,1,17500,"After Tom Casperson, a Republican state senator from Michigan's Upper Peninsula, began running for Congress in 2016, he assumed the family of Betsy DeVos, Donald J. Trump's nominee to be education secretary, would not oppose him. The DeVoses, a dominant force in Michigan politics for decades with a fortune in the billions, had contributed to one of Mr. Casperson's earlier campaigns. But a week before his primary, family members sent $24, 000 to one of his opponents, then poured $125, 000 into a super PAC, Concerned Taxpayers of America, that ran ads attacking him. The reason, an intermediary told Mr. Casperson: his support from organized labor. Deceitful, dishonest and cowardly, was how Mr. Casperson's campaign described the ads, complaining that the groups running them won't say who they are or where their money is coming from. On Primary Day, Mr. Casperson went down to defeat. In announcing his intention to nominate Ms. DeVos, Mr. Trump described her as a brilliant and passionate education advocate. Even critics characterized her as a dedicated, if misguided, activist for school reform. But that description understates both the breadth of Ms. DeVos's political interests and the influence she wields as part of her powerful family. More than anyone else who has joined the incoming Trump administration, she represents the combination of wealth, ideology and political hardball associated with a family of billionaires: Charles and David Koch. They have this moralized sense of the free market that leads to this total program to turn back the ideas of the New Deal, the welfare state, Kim a historian who has written extensively about the conservative movement, said, describing the DeVoses. Ms. DeVos declined to be interviewed for this article. Like the Kochs, the DeVoses are generous supporters of think tanks that evangelize for unrestrained capitalism, like Michigan's Acton Institute, and that rail against unions and back privatizing public services, like the Mackinac Center. They have also funded national groups dedicated to cutting back the role of government, including the National Center for Policy Analysis (which has pushed for Social Security privatization and against environmental regulation) and the Institute for Justice (which challenges regulations in court and defends school vouchers). Both organizations have also received money from the Koch family. Indeed, the DeVoses? education activism, which favors alternatives to traditional public schools, appears to derive from the same views that inform their suspicion of government. And perhaps more than other billionaires, the DeVoses couple their seeding of ideological causes with an aggressive brand of political spending. Half a dozen or more extended family members frequently coordinate contributions to maximize their impact. In the 2016 cycle alone, according to the Michigan Campaign Finance Network, the family spent roughly $14 million on political contributions to state and national candidates, parties, PACs and super PACs. All of this would make Ms. DeVos whose confirmation hearing has been delayed until next week amid mounting pressure that her government ethics review be completed beforehand very different from past education secretaries.

79,26,What significant event in Tom Casperson's political career was influenced by the DeVos family's opposition?,2,18356,"WASHINGTON Betsy DeVos, a wealthy Republican donor with almost no experience in public education, was confirmed by the Senate as the nation's education secretary on Tuesday, but only with the help of a historic tiebreaking vote from Vice President Mike Pence after weeks of protests and two defections within her own party. The vote capped an vigil on the Senate floor, where, one by one, Democrats denounced Ms. DeVos to a mostly empty chamber. But they did not get a third Republican defection that would have stopped Ms. DeVos a billionaire who has devoted much of her life to promoting charter schools and vouchers from becoming the steward of the nation's nearly 100, 000 public schools. It was the first time a vice president has been summoned to the Capitol to break a tie on a cabinet nomination. Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, demanded before the vote that Republicans explain how they could support Ms. DeVos. If we cannot set aside party loyalty long enough to perform the essential duty of vetting the president's nominees, what are we even doing here? Mr. Franken asked. The two Republicans who voted against the nominee, Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, said Ms. DeVos was unqualified because of a lack of familiarity with public schools and with laws meant to protect students. I have serious concerns about a nominee to be secretary of education who has been so involved in one side of the equation, so immersed in the push for vouchers, that she may be unaware of what actually is successful within the public schools, and also what is broken and how to fix them, Ms. Murkowski said last week when the two announced their opposition. Ms. Murkowski also said she had been influenced by thousands of messages she had received urging her to reject the nomination. For many educators, Ms. DeVos's support for charter schools and vouchers which allow students to use taxpayer dollars to pay tuition at private, religious and schools reflected a deep disconnect from public schools. Neither Ms. DeVos nor any of her children attended a public school. Most Republicans described Ms. DeVos as committed to what is best for children. In a fiery speech moments before the vote, Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and a former education secretary himself, criticized his Democratic colleagues for opposing Ms. DeVos, he said, simply because she was nominated by a Republican president. She led the most effective public school reform movement over the last few years, he said. Mr. Alexander, the chairman of the committee that approved Ms. DeVos's nomination last week in a split, said she had been at the forefront? of education overhaul for decades. By midday Tuesday, as the vote in the Senate deadlocked at 50 to 50, Mr. Pence, a former member of the House, took the gavel and at 12:29 p. m. declared his vote for Ms. DeVos.

The legislation largely ended the requirement that workers pay fees to unions as a condition of employment. Unions in the state bled members in 2014, the first full year the measure was in effect. Allies say the DeVoses fight for their beliefs. Betsy and Dick see themselves as principled conservatives, said Frederick Hess of the American Enterprise Institute. It kind of seems healthy and admirable to give resources to folks who are going to fight for causes you believe in. But the fights can appear to be as much about consolidating power as ideology. Unions were arguably the family's most formidable political opponent in Michigan, one of labor's traditional strongholds. The DeVos family's roots as education activists date back at least to when Richard DeVos Sr. was running Amway and an institute based at the company's headquarters trained teachers to inject principles into their curriculum. According to an interview Ms. DeVos gave to Philanthropy magazine, she and her husband became interested in education causes when they began visiting a Christian school that served children in Grand Rapids in the 1980s. If we could choose the right school for our kids? by which she appeared to mean primarily private schools it only seemed fair that they could do the same for theirs, she told the magazine. The family spent millions of dollars on a ballot proposal in 2000 asking if Michigan should legalize vouchers, in which students can use taxpayer money to attend private schools. Many critics, like the education historian Diane Ravitch, argue that the point of vouchers is to destroy public education and teachers? unions. The group Americans United for Separation of Church and State has documented how conservative Christians have long supported vouchers, which could fund religious schools. After voters objected by more than a ratio, Dick DeVos gave a speech at the Heritage Foundation saying such efforts would have to shift to state legislatures, where groups backed by donors could offer a political consequence for opposition, and political reward for support of education reform issues. It is not unusual for the wealthy who devote nearly 50 percent of their philanthropic dollars to education, according to the group to spend aggressively in the political realm to impose their preferred reforms. Even by these standards, however, the DeVoses stand out for the amount of money they spend trying to advance their goals through politics rather than philanthropy, such as research into reforms or subsidizing schools. As Sarah Reckhow, an expert on education philanthropy at Michigan State University, put it: The DeVoses are like: No, we know what we want. We don't need to have all this window dressing. ? Ms. DeVos has led two nonprofits that have spent millions of dollars electing governors and legislators sympathetic to school vouchers around the country. Matt Frendewey, a spokesman",-0.11073619

The Trump administration, lawyers involved in the effort said, is behind where it should be in this process of disentangling conflicts of interest. This is partly a reflection of the extraordinary complexity of negotiating such conflict of interest agreements for incoming government officials worth hundreds of millions, or even billions, of dollars. Usually, you just own a bunch of stocks and bonds, but he's getting people that own buildings and real estate and stuff you can't sell, said Alan Johnson, a New compensation consultant. He has Wilbur Ross, who is probably involved in a gazillion different things. I think it is going to be very complicated to try to disentangle all of these things. Mr. Ross is a billionaire investor and former banker who made a fortune in steel, coal, telecommunications and other industries. Under federal law, executive branch employees, including cabinet members, are prohibited from using their positions in the government to enrich themselves, meaning they are not allowed to participate in any particular matter that might directly financially benefit assets they own. The best way to avoid such a conflict, said Lawrence M. Noble, former general counsel at the Federal Election Commission, is to sell any assets like Exxon Mobil stock or any individual company stock and put proceeds into Treasury bonds or mutual funds. We don't want the decisions that these individuals make to be influenced in reality, or even appearance by their own financial interests, Mr. Noble said. They are working for the American people, and not to enrich themselves or their families. The rules do not apply to the president and vice president, although ethics experts and even the Office of Government Ethics have urged Mr. Trump to divest his assets voluntarily to rid himself of potential concerns as he takes over the White House. He has thus far resisted such a move, saying that he plans to let his two oldest sons and other Trump Organization executives manage the business, perhaps with an outside monitor. For appointees like Mr. Tillerson, the transition to government can have lucrative benefits: They can take advantage of measures in the tax code meant to be an incentive for wealthy people to consider public service jobs. The measure was put in place during the administration of the first President George Bush. This tax benefit, which requires approval by the Office of Government Ethics, allows government officials to defer paying capital gains taxes on certain assets that they must sell in order to clear potential conflicts as they take office essentially providing them with loans. To gain the tax advantage, the liquidated proceeds must then be invested in Treasury bonds, mutual funds or funds, and the official must seek a certificate of divestiture. Until now, Henry M. Paulson Jr. Treasury secretary under President George W. Bush, has been the most prominent example of a public official who has taken advantage of the divestiture certificate.

In an interview, David Boies, Mr. Greenberg's lawyer, called the agreement a nuisance settlement, noting that Mr. Greenberg had avoided two penalties sought by the state that would have barred him from working in the securities industry or as an officer of a public company. The settlement's outline was framed by the mediator, Kenneth R. Feinberg. The transactions were featured when A. I. G. settled accounting fraud charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2006. One, a reinsurance deal between A. I. G. and General Reinsurance Corporation, a company owned by Berkshire Hathaway, prompted federal criminal charges in Connecticut against several former executives of the companies two former Gen Re executives pleaded guilty. A 2008 jury verdict against five others was overturned on appeal. What began as a battle was nasty from the start. Before he brought the charges in May 2005, Mr. Spitzer had forced the ouster of Mr. Greenberg's son Jeffrey as chief executive of the insurance brokerage Marsh McLennan after charging it with and receiving kickbacks. And Mr. Greenberg complained that Mr. Spitzer was treating minor infractions, like foot faults? in tennis, as capital crimes. Mr. Spitzer shot back, too many foot faults, and you can lose the match. Early in the trial, Mr. Greenberg admitted to a sometimes active role in formulating the transactions at issue but insisted he had intended for them to comply with accounting rules. He said he had left most details to subordinates. On the stand, he lunged and parried with state trial lawyer David E. Nachman, avoiding simple answers so often that the judge chided him. If we don't want this trial to last a year, you're going to have to give direct answers, Judge Ramos said. In his opening statement, Mr. Boies said, this case is devoid of any admissible evidence that ties Mr. Greenberg to anything that was improper about these two transactions. Saule Omarova, who specializes in the regulation of financial institutions as a professor at Cornell Law School, said the case was about the legacies of Mr. Greenberg as A. I. G. s longtime leader and Mr. Spitzer as a onetime prominent Wall Street regulator. Stepping back, she said, the case is a prominent example of regulators? efforts to untangle the blame for activities at large financial conglomerates? that later loomed large in the financial crisis of 2008. Three years after the charges led to Mr. Greenberg's ouster, A. I. G. nearly collapsed and needed an $185 billion federal rescue. Mr. Spitzer resigned as New York governor in 2008 in a prostitution scandal. The state and the two defendants had reached an agreement to settle the case just before A. I. G. s .

Paulson Jr. Treasury secretary under President George W. Bush, has been the most prominent example of a public official who has taken advantage of the divestiture certificate. In 2006, Mr. Paulson left Goldman Sachs and sold an estimated $500 million in Goldman stock, deferring taxes on the sale. In his memo, Mr. Tillerson suggested that he was likely to seek such a certificate, and laid out a series of plans to divorce himself from financial engagements, board appointments and Exxon Mobil. This means he will most likely avoid capital gains taxes based on his sale of $50 million in Exxon Mobil stock he owns, as well as shares in more than 150 companies including Airbus and the Walt Disney Company, all of which he has promised to sell off within 90 days of his confirmation, his ethics documents suggest. But a more complicated task involved resolving the fate of two million shares of Exxon Mobil stock, worth about $180 million, that Mr. Tillerson was set to receive over the next decade. If he held on to this promised future payout from Exxon Mobil, he would still have a financial interest in matters that might affect the company and the oil industry. So Exxon Mobil agreed to take the unusual step of paying out the value of these sales and putting the money into an independent trust, with the money invested in neutral assets like Treasury bonds and mutual funds. Under the terms of the agreement, if Mr. Tillerson, 64, goes back into the oil industry during the next decade, he will forfeit any money left in the account. Richard W. Painter, a White House ethics lawyer during the administration of President George W. Bush, said this provision preventing Mr. Tillerson from returning to the oil industry was unusual and positive, as it removes the incentive for him to take steps while in government that might benefit an industry he planned to return to work for upon his departure. It gives up something I had never been able to get from other government officials a promise not to go back to an industry from which you came, Mr. Painter said. Still, some environmental activists say such steps cannot address what they argue will be Mr. Tillerson's inherent bias in the State Department.

But where else should one rank this Australian Open, where Federer was rightfully viewed as an underdog? Where he arrived seeded just 17th, having not played an official tournament for more than six months? Where he faced his friendly rival Rafael Nadal in the final on sore legs? Even Federer's own expectations were tempered for a change. I would have said a great event would be quarters, Federer said. Fourth round would be nice. Federer would get a great deal more than that in Melbourne, a city where his success has mingled with plenty of heartache and tears through the years. He wiped away a few more on Sunday as he became the oldest man to win a Grand Slam singles title in 45 years. He managed it by defeating Nadal, to win the Australian Open for the fifth time. You don't know if they ever come back, these moments, said Federer, who had not won a major title since Wimbledon in 2012 and who had not beaten Nadal in a Grand Slam final since Wimbledon in 2007. Federer played here with verve and precision but had to scrap his way through three matches in the final four rounds, receiving plenty of treatment between duels. Although he did not have to deal with the world's two leading players, Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic, who were upset in the first week, Federer did face top 10 opponents aplenty. He defeated four of them: Tomas Berdych, Kei Nishikori, Stan Wawrinka and most important Nadal, the swashbuckling Spanish who has so often thwarted Federer on big occasions but who failed to seal the deal on Sunday despite taking a lead in the fifth set. That was perhaps when Federer's tempered expectations helped him most. This really did feel like gravy after all the major meals he has enjoyed through the years, and he stuck with the game plan he and his coaches, Severin Lthi and Ivan Ljubicic, had discussed. I told myself to play free, Federer said. You play the ball. You don't play the opponent. Be free in your head. Be free in your shots. Go for it. The brave will be rewarded here. I didn't want to go down just making shots, seeing forehands rain down on me from Rafa. Few could have foreseen this final when the Australian Open began. This was Federer's first official tournament after a long break because of knee problems in 2016. Nadal ended last season early, too, after an injury to his left wrist. And yet the occasion felt so familiar, inciting global interest and nostalgia for the days when summit meetings were a staple. But this was not business as usual for Federer on a court that he repeatedly maintained was playing quicker than in past years. His backhand has long been his weak link against Nadal, whose whipping",4.852027

No man has done so well at any Grand Slam tournament without breaking through to win the title. Others have lost five finals in the same major event, including Lendl, who lost five at the United States Open. But he also won three. Bill Johnston lost six finals at the United States Championships, but won the event twice. John Bromwich lost five finals at the Australian Championships in the era, but won the title twice, too. Murray, at 29, is in unfortunately uncharted territory, all the more so because Novak Djokovic ended his own long run of frustration at the French Open last year by finally taking the title after reaching four semifinals and three finals. Look, it's still a remarkable record, five Slam finals in Australia, and deep down I think it means an enormous amount to Andy to finally complete the puzzle, said Roger Rasheed, the Australian who once coached Lleyton Hewitt when Hewitt was chasing the title here without success. But Hewitt reached only one final in Melbourne. Murray is here and has a better winning percentage at the Australian Open than at any other Grand Slam tournament except Wimbledon. Andy's been so close, Rasheed said. What more does he have to do? Well, it's not a matter of big changes. It's just been a matter of points and the moments. It's a matter of the opposition, too. The first of Murray's Australian Open defeats in the final came against Roger Federer in 2010. The last four came against Djokovic in 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2016. Andy played Roger in his prime and has been playing Novak in his prime, Rasheed said. It's a handful of points changing the way the match falls. Andy's showing he's in his prime now. He just needs to get there and roll the dice again. Murray's timing may still not be quite right. He played a great deal of tennis down the stretch in 2016 and was beaten by Djokovic in a final in Doha, Qatar, to start this season. Freshness just might be a factor down the stretch as well as Djokovic's eagerness to restore the pecking order. But it does not seem quite right in light of their abilities that Djokovic has six Australian Open titles and Murray has not even one. He broke down in tears after losing to Federer in 2010. He stared vacantly into space after losses to Djokovic and sportingly came up with the right words amid major disappointment. And yet he insisted on Monday that his emotions were not mixed when he thought about this tournament. Honestly, they're totally positive, said Murray, who plays Andrey Rublev in the second round on Wednesday. I've had a lot of tough losses here, for sure. But I love it here.

In Sunday's final, Nadal, 30, will face his longtime rival Roger Federer, 35, a nostalgic counterpoint to the women's championship match between Venus Williams, 36, and Serena Williams, 35. Nadal and Federer have not met in a Grand Slam final since the 2011 French Open. Against Dimitrov, Nadal saved three break points in a tightly fought fifth set, including two at . With a backhand winner down the line, he earned the crucial break in the next game to go up by and serve for the match. On Nadal's third match point, Dimitrov's final backhand landed long to end a rally, and Nadal fell to the ground in relief. Difficult to describe the emotions, he said in his interview. First of all, I was tired. That last point was emblematic of how the Nadal managed to outlast the Dimitrov, time and again showing his superior physicality in the longest exchanges. The two were more evenly matched on shorter points, but of the 64 points that lasted nine or more shots, Nadal won 39. Dimitrov, 25, had reached only one previous Grand Slam semifinal, at Wimbledon in 2014, but he rarely seemed daunted by the occasion. Already to start the year and a title in Brisbane to his name, Dimitrov frequently displayed improved power and consistency in the match, even as it wore on into the fifth set, striking 79 winners to 45 for Nadal. But he could not match Nadal's ability to turn defense into offense few can. Dimitrov's backhand was particularly exposed by Nadal's attacks and counted for the majority of his forced and unforced errors. It's never easy to lose a match like that, Dimitrov said. I'm happy, though, with a lot of things. I'm going to stay positive and keep my head up high. For sure, Rafa deserves pretty much all the credit right now since he's such a fighter, such a competitor. At the same time it was an honor for me to play a match like that against him. It also shows me that I'm in a good way, I'm on the right path. Nadal started the match with dominant serving, winning 90 percent of points on his serve in the first set. But in the second set, Nadal dropped serve three times and Dimitrov twice. Dimitrov, former player who tumbled to 40th last summer, held firm after Nadal won the third set in a tiebreaker. Neither player faced a break point in the fourth set, won by Dimitrov in another tiebreaker. Nadal, a major champion, last reached a Grand Slam final at the 2014 French Open, which he won.

Mr. Lynton, who weathered various corporate crises at Sony Entertainment over his tenure, including a devastating cyberattack and a battle with activist investors, will step down on Feb. 2, the company said. After that, Kazuo Hirai, the president and chief executive of Sony Corporation, based in Tokyo, will take a more role at the conglomerate's movie, television and music division, at least for a time. Mr. Hirai will begin keeping a second office at Sony's studio complex in Culver City, Calif. the company said, and take the additional title of executive of Sony Entertainment. Mr. Lynton will also serve as executive for a period starting in February to help Mr. Hirai learn the inner workings of the movie and television businesses and select a permanent successor. In the meantime, Mr. Lynton, 57, will officially become chairman of the board at Snap Inc. which owns Snapchat. Snap is expected to go public with an eye toward being valued at $30 billion or more this spring. As chairman, Mr. Lynton is not expected to play a direct management role, but rather focus on matters involving strategy and governance in support of Evan Spiegel, Snap's chief executive. I have been involved with Evan and Snapchat since its early days, and, given its growth since then, decided the time was right to transition, Mr. Lynton said in a statement. He added that he was confident that the broad changes we have made and new management team we have assembled over the last few years? at Sony would bear fruit.

In 2015, he met with China's president, Xi Jinping, as a member of the 21st Century Council at the Berggruen Institute. Its founder, Nicolas Berggruen, said he impressed a group that includes Mohamed the economist, and former President Nicolas Sarkozy of France with his thoughtful and mature approach to people. Last fall, Mr. Spiegel also attended a private dinner with John O. Brennan, then the director of the C. I. A. According to multiple attendees, Mr. Spiegel listened more than he spoke and had the ear of Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles. Mr. Spiegel's unconventional streak may be most evident in how he has steered Snap. He has long said that a public offering was what was best for the company and its investors, even as other tech chose to stay private as long as possible. Since Snapchat's debut, the app and the company have also undergone dozens of changes that were criticized for being too different from other consumer internet companies. Mr. Spiegel rejected the idea of a newsfeed in Snapchat's app, for example, because he said people prefer stories chronologically. In Facebook's News Feed, posts are reverse chronological, meaning the newest posts are at the top. Unlike other social networks, Snapchat also does not use algorithms to push people to see certain content. Snapchat users swipe their screens to navigate and view video vertically, rather than tap on menus or turn their phones to watch videos horizontally. From what I can figure out, he thinks differently about the way to monetize and develop a social network, Mr. Schmidt said of Mr. Spiegel. Investors who buy into Snap's initial public offering will soon be getting a piece of that approach. Allowing ourselves to be pulled in another direction? is what makes us human, Mr. Spiegel said in a commencement speech at the University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business in 2015. Quoting John F. Kennedy, he added, Conformity is the jailer of freedom and the enemy of growth.",-2.9796126
92,30,Who announced their resignation from Sony's entertainment division to focus on Snapchat?,3,18214,"LOS ANGELES When Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy were undergraduates at Stanford University, they made an unconventional observation about what makes a social network valuable. Thanks to the rise of Facebook, most everyone believed that networks became exponentially more valuable by amassing more users. But Mr. Spiegel noticed that in real life, even people with thousands of acquaintances spent most of their time with just a few friends whose value outweighed a large number of looser ties. So when Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy created Snapchat in 2011, they inverted the social networking dynamic. Out of their Stanford dorm rooms, they made Snapchat as an app that would send disappearing messages and photos in a way that more closely mimicked the dynamics of a real world conversation. That would increase the appeal of Snapchat as a service that people used with a small number of good friends, they figured. While online identity previously emphasized everything anyone has ever done, with Snapchat my identity is who I am right now, Mr. Spiegel said in a 2015 video to describe the app. Mr. Spiegel, 26, Snap's chief executive, has since built a budding digital empire based on that initial unconventional insight and has continued upending the tech industry with his different way of seeing the world, often with a touch of ego. Rather than accept the norms of the social networking ecosystem, he has stuck to atypical viewpoints on matters from mobile video to spectacles. And he has done all of this more than 350 miles away from Silicon Valley, in the sunny climes of Venice, Calif. where Snapchat is based. Mr. Spiegel's singular approach will soon be more publicly on display. This week, Snapchat's parent company, Snap, is expected to reveal its public stock offering paperwork for the first time. The filing will show how Snap is doing as a business and whether that justifies a public valuation of $20 billion to $25 billion, which the company has been reported to be seeking. It will also disclose Mr. Spiegel's ownership stake in Snap the public offering is set to vault Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy, who is now chief technology officer, into the ranks of other tech billionaires. Along with financial information, Mr. Spiegel is expected to include remarks about Snap's mission that will showcase his philosophy. If you want to understand Snap, look at Evan Spiegel, said Todd Chaffee, a partner at IVP, one of Snap's three largest venture capital investors. He is the visionary who drives that company. Mary Ritti, a spokeswoman for Snap, declined to comment for this story. Mr. Spiegel grew up in Pacific Palisades, a wealthy Los Angeles suburb, and attended Crossroads, a prep school in Santa Monica that counts Jonah Hill, Kate Hudson and Jack Black as alumni. He lived a privileged life, with expensive cars, exclusive club memberships and fancy vacations, according to records from his parents? divorce proceedings.

93,31,What was the incident involving a Palestinian driver and Israeli soldiers that occurred in Jerusalem?,1,17484,"JERUSALEM A Palestinian driver plowed a truck into a group of Israeli soldiers as they were getting off a bus in Jerusalem on Sunday afternoon, killing four and injuring 17 others, according to the police and witnesses. The police called the episode an act of terrorism. Micky Rosenfeld, a police spokesman, said the attacker had been shot, and the police released images showing the truck's windshield riddled with bullet holes. The dead included three female soldiers and one male soldier, the Israeli military confirmed. Several people were hospitalized, some with critical injuries. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the scene of the attack and said the perpetrator was by all indications a supporter of the Islamic State. This is part of the same pattern inspired by Islamic State, by ISIS, that we saw first in France, then in Germany and now in Jerusalem. This is part of the same ongoing battle against this global scourge of the new terrorism, he added. Mr. Netanyahu has often made the comparison between local attacks against Israelis and those in the rest of the world, though the attacks in Israel are more broadly viewed as being more connected to the conflict. While the Israeli security services have described a few Palestinian attackers as having been inspired by the ideology of the Islamic State, no direct links have been established between them and the organization. The attack on Sunday occurred on the Armon Hanatziv Promenade, a popular tourist spot between East Jerusalem and West Jerusalem that offers sweeping views of the Old City. The four soldiers killed were Erez Orbach, 20, from Alon Shvut, in the West Bank Yael Yekutiel, 20, from Givatayim, near Tel Aviv Shir Hajaja, 22, from Maale Adumim in the West Bank and Shira Tzur, 20, from Haifa. The violence ended several months of relative calm in the contested city, after a period of frequent stabbings, shootings and car attacks. It also underlined the volatility of the situation at a time when Donald J. Trump has promised to move the United States Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, a potentially explosive step that American administrations have avoided for decades. Palestinian officials say it would destroy the chances of any peace process by prejudging the outcome, and some have said it would constitute a declaration of war against Palestinians. Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, said on Friday that the Palestinians would view any such change in the status quo in Jerusalem as the crossing of a red line. Mosque preachers addressed the proposed embassy move in their sermons during Friday prayers, apparently on the instruction of the Palestinian Authority. The Palestinians demand East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state. Israel captured the area from Jordan in the 1967 war and claims sovereignty there. Hamas, the Islamic militant group that holds sway in Gaza, praised Sunday's attack, without taking responsibility for it.

The fourth was the 300th graduate of her Haifa high school to have died while serving as a soldier. Israel buried its latest terrorism victims on Monday, the day after they were run down by a Palestinian man in a truck, enveloping them in the country's familiar outpouring of love for its service members. But this time, the usually unifying ritual was marred by discord. Israelis called it the Azaria effect, referring to Sgt. Elor Azaria, the soldier who was convicted last week of manslaughter for shooting a wounded and incapacitated Palestinian assailant in the head. Video from the scene of Sunday's attack showed dozens of armed soldiers fleeing from the truck instead of trying to shoot the driver. Some Israelis who had complained that the army's high command failed to back up Sergeant Azaria asserted that the soldiers had fallen short because they were afraid of being put on trial. The military, security experts and soldiers at the scene quickly rejected that notion. Those who ran from the scene were not concerned about Azaria, but about their own said Yehuda Ben Meir, an expert in national security and public opinion at the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University. Still, the argument unfolding in full volume on Israeli news sites, social media and broadcast channels reflected the disruptive influence the Azaria affair has had on the army and its central place in Israeli society. In this small, country where most Jewish are drafted into years of service, the military has long been a rare reserve of respect and consensus. Yet the same sentiment that leads Israeli Jews to treat soldiers as everybody's children? has also led many to call for a pardon for Sergeant Azaria, creating tension between the people and the commanders of their army. The motherly protection of soldiers sometimes overcomes your basic value system, Mr. Ben Meir said, adding that the instinct to protect soldiers was not particular to Israel. The soldiers targeted by the Palestinian truck driver on Sunday were in officer training programs, and most were not preparing for combat roles. Many were in the educational corps or training for administrative jobs on the home front. On a routine educational tour of Jerusalem, they were caught as they disembarked from buses at a popular observation spot with panoramic views of Old City. The truck driver plowed into one group, then reversed and came back to claim more victims. A tour guide who shot at the truck with his pistol complained on television that the soldiers were better equipped with but had hesitated to shoot.

Nickolay Mladenov, the United Nations special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, condemned the attack in a statement. It is reprehensible that some choose to glorify such acts, which undermine the possibility of a peaceful future for both Palestinians and Israelis, he said. There is nothing heroic in such actions. The Palestinian official news agency, WAFA, identified the driver of the truck as Fadi Ahmad 28, a resident of the nearby Palestinian neighborhood of Jabel Mukaber in East Jerusalem. Ribhi Ewiysat, a resident of the neighborhood, said that a large number of Israeli security forces had entered the area and were at the attacker's house. Chaim Newman, a tour guide who was accompanying the group of soldiers at the scene, told Israel Radio, The soldiers got off the bus, and we were getting organized when suddenly the truck came with great speed and rammed into the group. Civilians and soldiers began shooting, and this prevented a worse tragedy, he added. He rammed them a number of times, going into reverse and forward in order to hurt more people. Chen Lendi Sharon, a paramedic from the Magen David Adom ambulance service, said there was chaos on the scene? when she arrived. I saw a truck that rammed youngsters getting off the bus next to the Armon Hanatziv observation point. Ms. Lendi Sharon said that at least 10 people were trapped under the bus or were lying on the grass by the road. The attack occurred around 1:30 p. m. Dozens of soldiers were getting off buses at the site as part of a routine educational tour of Jerusalem. Aged 18 to 21, they were cadets from an officers? course, Israel Radio reported. About two hours after the attack, the truck, a white flatbed with a crane on the back, remained at the scene and an ambulance was still removing bodies. Dovy Meyer, a spokesman for the United Hatzalah ambulance service who was at the scene, said that around 100 soldiers had been milling about when the attack occurred. A spate of deadly stabbings, shootings and car attacks began in October 2015 and quickly spread from Jerusalem and the West Bank to cities around Israel. More than 30 Israelis and two American visitors were among those killed in the attacks. More than 240 Palestinians have been killed during that period, many of them while carrying out or intending to carry out attacks, according to Israeli officials.

96,32,How many people did Governor Peter Shumlin of Vermont pardon for misdemeanor marijuana convictions?,1,17406,"Nearly 200 of the approximately 450 people who asked Gov. Peter Shumlin of Vermont to forgive their misdemeanor marijuana convictions had their wish fulfilled this week. In one of his final acts in office, Governor Shumlin on Tuesday pardoned 192 people convicted of marijuana possession, fulfilling a promise he made early last month to consider forgiveness for anyone who applied by Christmas. While attitudes and laws about marijuana use are rapidly changing, there is still a harmful stigma associated with it, Mr. Shumlin, a Democrat, said in a statement on Tuesday. My hope was to help as many individuals as I could overcome that stigma and the very real struggles that too often go along with it. Such charges can stand in the way of finding work, being accepted to college and traveling internationally. The pardons were limited to people who had no violent criminal histories or felony convictions, and who had not been found guilty of driving under the influence or reckless driving. People who did not apply for a pardon under Mr. Shumilin can still apply to have marijuana possession convictions expunged from their record through a court process established under a 2013 state decriminalization law. Mr. Shumlin cited that law and his own support for legalizing marijuana as the basis for the pardons. Vermont should follow the many states that are legalizing and regulating the use of marijuana and put to an end the incredible failure that is the War on Drugs, he said in the statement. His successor, Phil Scott, a Republican, has urged caution, though he has signaled he may be open to legalization eventually. He is scheduled to be sworn in on Thursday and has said that he supports the pardons, according to local news reports. Those who received the pardons ranged in age from 22 to 69, though most were younger than 40. All but 15 live in Vermont. In all, Mr. Shumlin has issued 208 pardons since taking office in 2010, more than any other governor in the history of the state, his office said.",10.366063
97,32,How many people did Governor Peter Shumlin of Vermont pardon for misdemeanor marijuana convictions?,2,17820,"After eluding prosecution in the United States for decades and escaping from prison twice in Mexico, the crime lord Joaqun Guzmn Loera, better known as El Chapo, appeared on Friday in federal court in Brooklyn and pleaded not guilty to charges that he had overseen a drug empire. Prosecutors said the operation had moved at least 200 tons of cocaine into the United States, had earned $14 billion in profits and had been protected by an army of assassins who killed thousands of people. Mr. Guzmn's arraignment, in Federal District Court, was both a news media spectacle and a pro forma counterpoint to his sudden extradition from Mexico on Thursday afternoon, when a police jet flew him from the border to MacArthur Airport in Islip, on Long Island. The brief court proceeding took place under tight security, with police vehicles, heavily armed guards and dogs patrolling the grounds outside the courthouse. Dressed for his arraignment in a blue blue pajama pants and blue sneakers, Mr. Guzmn, 59, stood with his lawyers in front of Magistrate Judge James Orenstein in a courtroom packed with prosecutors, federal agents and reporters. Are you Mr. Guzmn? Judge Orenstein asked the defendant. S, se'or, Mr. Guzmn said. The judge then asked Mr. Guzmn if he understood the charges he was facing. S, se'or, he said again. Those charges had been detailed earlier on Friday at a news conference. At the briefing, Robert L. Capers, the United States attorney in Brooklyn, called the extradition of Mr. Guzmn, whose nickname means Shorty, a milestone in the pursuit of a trafficker who achieved mythic status in his homeland as a Robin outlaw and a serial prison escapee. Saying that Mr. Guzmn now faced life in prison on a charge of running a continuing criminal enterprise, Mr. Capers sought to play down Mr. Guzmn's role as a folk hero and promised that he would not escape his American jailers. Who is Chapo Guzmn? Mr. Capers said, flanked by a phalanx of officials from local, state and federal agencies. In short, he is a man who has known no other life than one of crime, violence, death and destruction. Even at a courthouse that has seen the prosecution of Mafia dons like John J. Gotti, the onetime Gambino family boss, and corrupt public officials like Meade Esposito, the former Brooklyn Democratic leader, the arrival of Mr. Guzmn sent a charge through the building, where scores of international reporters were on hand. In an extraordinary confluence of events, Mr. Guzmn was taken from Mexico by plane on the eve of the inauguration of Donald J. Trump and was arraigned in Brooklyn only hours after Mr. Trump was sworn in. After the hearing, he was returned to the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan, a federal jail that has housed some of New York's federal defendants, including many facing terrorism charges. As the day began, prosecutors in Brooklyn issued a memo laying out their arguments for keeping Mr. Guzmn in custody. They noted",-9.2076025
98,32,How many people did Governor Peter Shumlin of Vermont pardon for misdemeanor marijuana convictions?,3,17958,"MOSCOW Russian lawmakers on Wednesday moved to decriminalize some forms of domestic battery for offenders who do not do serious physical harm to their victims. Members of the State Duma passed the controversial amendment to the Russian criminal code in its second reading, which essentially assures it will go to President Vladimir V. Putin for his signature. The amendment treats a first conviction for domestic battery as an administrative offense, carrying a penalty of a $500 fine or 15 days in jail. If Mr. Putin signs the measure into law, only injuries like concussions or broken bones, or repeated offenses committed in a family setting, would lead to criminal charges. Defenders of the measure say it will protect parents? rights to discipline their children and generally reduce the state's role in domestic life. In the traditional Russian family culture, relations between fathers and sons? are built upon the authority of parents? power, mutual love and personal indispensability as the basis for children's upbringing, said Yelena B. Mizulina, one of the initiators of the new legislation and author of a law that banned gay propaganda? aimed at minors. Opponents called it a step back to medieval times and a license for violent behavior by domestic tyrants. It is clear that lawmakers recognized violence as a norm of family life, said Svetlana G. Aivazova, a Russian specialist in gender studies. This shows that Duma deputies are not simply conservative or traditional, it shows that they are archaic. Ms. Aivazova and other experts say that Russia has a serious problem with domestic violence. Citing data provided by Russia's Interior Ministry, Ms. Aivazova told Mr. Putin in 2015 that 40 percent of all grave violent crimes are committed in families. In 2013, she said, more than 9, 000 women died in criminal assaults and more than 11, 000 were badly injured. In 2014, she said, more than 25 percent of all murders were committed in families. In the United States, by comparison, 11, 766 women were killed by a husband or boyfriend in the years 2001 to 2012, an average of about 1, 000 a year in a country with about twice the population of Russia. Ms. Aivazova asked Mr. Putin to support a special law on the prevention of domestic violence that had already been passed in 143 countries, including Russia's neighbors Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. Mr. Putin thanked her, but the law remained in the State Duma, and Ms. Aivazova said she was not optimistic about its prospects. In the past, Mr. Putin has expressed concern about domestic violence, even in the absence of serious injury. I think we should not slap children and justify it based on some old traditions, he told journalists at his last news conference in December. There is a short distance from slaps to beating. The new legislation was pushed by conservative members of the Russian parliament and the Russian Orthodox Church, who were incensed last summer when lawmakers criminalized domestic violence, acting upon a recommendation by the",-9.243306
99,33,Who attended the Women's March on Washington?,1,17863,"NILES, Mich. When Jennifer Purucker, 31, was asked on Saturday morning what she thought of the Women's March on Washington, she took a sip of coffee and shook her head. Never heard of it, she said. Crystal Mangold, 38, paused as she carried her young daughter down Main Street. No idea what it is, she said. Angie Searles, 45, perked up at the mention. Oh, I just saw that on the news, she said. I don't know anyone who's going. The march galvanized hundreds of thousands of women across the country who packed buses and airplanes to flock to the nation's capital to fight for reproductive and civil rights under the Trump administration. Across the country, they rallied en masse on Saturday in downtowns, wearing pink knit pussy hats, waving handmade signs and sharing pictures on social media with the hashtag #WomensMarch. But as conversations unfolded in Niles, a riverfront town of 11, 000 in southwest Michigan, it was a reminder of how the country has become a split screen on issue after issue. Those women don't represent me or my viewpoints, said Leta Nielsen, 66, a retired teacher, who added that she hoped that demonstrators would not start fires like the ones she saw on the news from the protests surrounding the inauguration on Friday. In Niles, the biggest draw of the weekend was the annual ice festival, which attracted people from all over the region to admire elaborate ice sculptures lining the sidewalks, participate in a 5K race and sample the tall, spicy bloody marys at the Brass Eye cocktail lounge. I don't think my husband would support me going, said Stephanie Palmisano, 26, a medical worker who supported Hillary Clinton but whose husband voted for President Trump. Trump winning has caused a lot of tough conversations in our marriage. I have two little girls. For a president who thinks so low of women, it just breaks my heart. Lucy VandenHeede, 79, said that her and two granddaughters had taken a bus to Washington from Kalamazoo, Mich. to attend the march and that she was cheering them on from afar. Women's rights have come a long way, she said, recalling the days when she worked in the newspaper business selling advertising and was paid far less than her male colleagues. They earned commission, and I didn't, she said. And I was always called Mrs. John VandenHeede.? I didn't even have a name. She was the best salesman in the bunch, too, said her husband, Mr. VandenHeede. Other women sharply questioned the notion of protesting a president whose administration had begun only the day before. It's kind of offensive, said Linda Hine, 56, an accounting manager who voted for Mr. Trump. People are just criticizing because they didn't get their way. All it did was force another reason for people to be divided.

100,33,Who attended the Women's March on Washington?,2,18011,"Opponents of abortion watching the women's march on their televisions last Saturday stewed as they saw the Planned Parenthood logo over the stage and the actress Scarlett Johansson praising the group for the gynecological care she received as a teenager. But for these viewers, there was an even bigger problem. The women's march had drawn an estimated people to Washington, and many more to simultaneous demonstrations around the country, dominating the nation's news coverage just six days before abortion foes were holding their annual march. Since then, the organizers of that march have been telling their followers: You'd better turn out on Friday. This year's march in Washington the 44th annual March for Life was expected to be a celebratory event at which abortion opponents could finally savor a few victories. The new president, Donald J. Trump, is already delivering on his promises to sign a slate of measures. He has promised to nominate a Supreme Court justice who could overturn Roe v. Wade, the decision that legalized abortion 44 years ago. And a Congress dominated by Republicans is poised to cut funding for Planned Parenthood, the nation's largest abortion provider. But a new sense of urgency, anxiety and maybe a little envy has accompanied this year's event, with organizers suddenly realizing they had a tough act to follow. We're definitely pulling out all the stops this year to try to get people to come, said Amelia Irvine, president of Georgetown Right to Life at Georgetown University in Washington. National organizers of the March for Life said that while they were hopeful of a large turnout on Friday, they did not have any way to gauge how many would attend. This year's event will have two major draws: Vice President Mike Pence and Kellyanne Conway, who managed Mr. Trump's campaign and is now a White House counselor, are scheduled to speak. No president or vice president has ever addressed the march in person. Last year, many marchers were deterred by a snowstorm that trapped some buses en route and stranded some marchers in town for days afterward. Organizers said that since so many had to cancel last year, there is energy this year. One of the largest turnouts was in 2013, the 40th anniversary of Roe v. Wade and the march itself. Some abortion opponents claimed that as many as 650, 000 marchers showed up. But for this and every year, the March for Life organization itself played it conservative, estimating that the marchers numbered in the tens of thousands. I don't think that these numbers are the most important, said Jeanne Mancini, president of the March for Life, in a telephone interview. The number most important for us is 58 million, which is the number of Americans that have been lost to abortion. She said that calls and emails began pouring into March for Life's offices last Sunday from women who are opposed to abortion and were disturbed to see the strong abortion rights message coming from the stage",5.483855
101,33,Who attended the Women's March on Washington?,3,17833,"?One of the great weapons of a democracy. This was how Harry Belafonte, the performer and civil rights activist, referred to the street march in a recent interview. Mr. Belafonte played a critical role in organizing the 1963 March on Washington, which helped spur the passage of two major civil rights bills. He is also a of the women's march set for Saturday. When thousands of women converge on Washington this weekend, they will join a long tradition of rallies in the capital. From the suffrage processions of the early 20th century to the Tea Party rallies of 2009, marches have drawn attention to crucial issues, occasionally resulted in violence and often prompted opposing gatherings. Marian B. Mollin, an associate professor at Virginia Tech who studies the history of social movements, said successful marches had capitalized on symbolism and street theater, attracted a broad coalition and pushed clear policy goals. But the test of a march's efficacy, she said, is whether it energizes participants long after they've gone home, sustaining them through the less exciting aspects of change. This is what she'll be watching for in the months after Saturday's march. Are they continuing to be fired up when they get back? Because there is a lot of unfun, unglamorous work to do, she said. We took a look back at several marches in Washington and how they changed or didn't change history. On March 3, 1913, a named Inez Milholland slipped on her white kid boots, threw a cape around her shoulders and climbed onto a borrowed horse to help lead what was then the largest women's march in American history. Behind her came businesswomen in blue, writers in white, artists in pink and musicians in red, all calling for their right to vote. Five thousand women marched while some onlookers hurled insults and tripped them. If my wife were where you are, a police officer told one woman, according to this newspaper, I'd break her head. Woodrow Wilson skipped the event, taking side streets to a hotel to avoid the crowds. By the end, more than 100 women were hospitalized. Women had fought for suffrage since at least 1848. But the 1913 march kicked off a series of political actions that swayed the public and male politicians, finally pushing them to pass the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. By 1920, American women had the right to vote. Read how The New York Times covered the march here. On July 28, 1932, Gen. Douglas MacArthur and Army troops surrounded a group of protesting veterans in Washington, wheeled tanks into position, prepared gas bombs and gave the former fighters 30 minutes to disperse. The Bonus Army gathering, in which an estimated 20, 000 World War I veterans demanded the payment of bonuses guaranteed under a 1924 law, is among the marches in American history. The law had said payments would be made in 1945, but veterans reeling from the Depression wanted them earlier. The event lasted weeks, until President Herbert",5.231509
102,34,What was the outcome of the 1998 Australian Open match between Venus and Serena Williams?,1,17990,"MELBOURNE, Australia The sibling rivalry, at least on the tennis tour, started right here at the Australian Open for the Williams sisters. It was 1998, and older sister Venus beat younger sister Serena, (4) in a match that as intrusive as it felt to watch surely drew more attention than any match in history between a pair of Australian Open debutantes. The fascination in their dynamic and their futures was there from the start in Melbourne Park, known then as Flinders Park when it had only one stadium with a retractable roof instead of three. A picture of Venus consoling Serena after the match was on the front page of The New York Times. Though it would be tempting to label their Australian Open final on Saturday as a moment and to speculate that it might be their last meeting at this late a stage of a Grand Slam tournament, it seems best to resist the temptation. The Williams sisters have taught us a lot about the limits of conventional tennis wisdom through the years. And so, even if 19 years have passed and Serena is now 35 and Venus 36, it is wise to avoid fencing them in again after they have run roughshod over so many other preconceptions. I watched Venus today celebrating after she won the semifinal like she was a girl, and it made you want to cry for joy just watching her, said Marion Bartoli, a former Wimbledon champion. Such a powerful image, and it makes you think about all those questions she was getting: When are you retiring? Have you thought about retiring? How much longer? You must let the champions decide when the right moment comes. The Williamses are both great champions, even if Serena is clearly the greater player with her 22 Grand Slam singles titles and her long run at No. 1, a spot she can reclaim from Angelique Kerber with a win Saturday. Serena has been the most prolific Grand Slam winner after age 30 in tennis history, and she is back in rare form again after another extended break at the end of 2016. She disconnected completely from the game and physical training initially and had to push hard to get back in shape in November and December. It worked. She has not dropped a set here despite a challenging draw, nor has she even been pushed to a tiebreaker. Newly engaged to the American technology entrepreneur Alexis Ohanian, who has watched her matches from the players box, and seemingly refreshed, Serena deserves to be the favorite to win her 23rd major singles title and break her tie with Steffi Graf for the highest total in the Open era. In this tournament, Serena has beaten two former members of the top 10 Belinda Bencic and Lucie Safarova and one current member, the No. 9 seed Johanna Konta. Venus's draw has been soft by comparison, devoid of top 10 players past or present and including only one seeded player: No.",4.9244885

But there was no hiding the other statistical stakes as Williams walked back into Rod Laver Arena, headphones around her neck and in place, to play her older sister Venus Williams in the Australian Open final. The tennis circuit can be an echo chamber where the same questions and themes reverberate from week to week as the locations change, but the protagonists do not. So even if Serena Williams refused to entertain questions during the tournament about the possibility of winning her 23rd Grand Slam singles title and breaking her tie for the record with Steffi Graf, there was no dodging that number in her own head. Now, after her victory over her sister, she can celebrate No. 23 instead of fret over it. I've been chasing it for a really long time, Williams said. When it got on my radar, I knew I had an opportunity to get there, and I'm here. It's a great feeling. No better place to do it than Melbourne. She and her sister made their first visit to Melbourne in 1998. They were teenagers with braces on their teeth and braids in their hair and a clear sense that they were special, but no idea of just how far their talents and confidence would carry them. Much has changed in 19 years. Rod Laver Arena now has a wraparound digital screen at court level and electronic line calling. The court, once green, is now a deep blue. The beads and the braces are long gone, but the sisters? power tennis remains. And though their father, Richard Williams, in one of the great sports predictions, saw the future clearly when he said the younger, fiercer Serena would turn out to be the better player, perhaps not even he realized how wide the gap would eventually grow. Serena Williams now has 23 major singles titles to her sister's seven, and has won seven of their nine Grand Slam finals and eight of their last nine matches. Those figures brook no argument. Williams 2. 0 has the better operating system when it comes to locating the lines and creating the angles under the greatest pressure. She also has the purer service motion. But Williams 1. 0 certainly gave it her all Saturday night, throwing herself into the groundstrokes and displaying more emotion when a return struck the net or a rally failed than she has perhaps ever shown in a major final. It was palpable how much Venus wanted it, said Isha Price, the Williamses? half sister. An final is always an emotionally complex affair, which is all the more reason to admire how the older sister has so often handled the disappointments. That's my little sister, guys, Venus Williams said, pointing at Serena during the ceremony. She then spoke to her sister",2.2645822
104,34,What was the outcome of the 1998 Australian Open match between Venus and Serena Williams?,3,18024,"MELBOURNE, Australia Rafael Nadal completed a slate of throwback singles finals at the Australian Open, beating Grigor Dimitrov, (5) (4) in a battle of 4 hours 56 minutes that started Friday evening and ended at 12:44 Saturday morning. In Sunday's final, Nadal, 30, will face his longtime rival Roger Federer, 35, a nostalgic counterpoint to the women's championship match between Venus Williams, 36, and Serena Williams, 35. Nadal and Federer have not met in a Grand Slam final since the 2011 French Open. Against Dimitrov, Nadal saved three break points in a tightly fought fifth set, including two at . With a backhand winner down the line, he earned the crucial break in the next game to go up by and serve for the match. On Nadal's third match point, Dimitrov's final backhand landed long to end a rally, and Nadal fell to the ground in relief. Difficult to describe the emotions, he said in his interview. First of all, I was tired. That last point was emblematic of how the Nadal managed to outlast the Dimitrov, time and again showing his superior physicality in the longest exchanges. The two were more evenly matched on shorter points, but of the 64 points that lasted nine or more shots, Nadal won 39. Dimitrov, 25, had reached only one previous Grand Slam semifinal, at Wimbledon in 2014, but he rarely seemed daunted by the occasion. Already to start the year and a title in Brisbane to his name, Dimitrov frequently displayed improved power and consistency in the match, even as it wore on into the fifth set, striking 79 winners to 45 for Nadal. But he could not match Nadal's ability to turn defense into offense few can. Dimitrov's backhand was particularly exposed by Nadal's attacks and counted for the majority of his forced and unforced errors. It's never easy to lose a match like that, Dimitrov said. I'm happy, though, with a lot of things. I'm going to stay positive and keep my head up high. For sure, Rafa deserves pretty much all the credit right now since he's such a fighter, such a competitor. At the same time it was an honor for me to play a match like that against him. It also shows me that I'm in a good way, I'm on the right path. Nadal started the match with dominant serving, winning 90 percent of points on his serve in the first set. But in the second set, Nadal dropped serve three times and Dimitrov twice. Dimitrov, former player who tumbled to 40th last summer, held firm after Nadal won the third set in a tiebreaker. Neither player faced a break point in the fourth set, won by Dimitrov in another tiebreaker. Nadal, a major champion, last reached a Grand Slam final at the 2014 French Open, which he won. He last reached a final in Melbourne earlier that year, losing to Stan Wawrinka. Nadal has missed large stretches of competition in recent years because of various",1.9949186
105,35,What role did Steve Bannon receive in the National Security Council?,1,18074,"WASHINGTON The Trump administration defended on Sunday a reorganization of the National Security Council that elevates the president's chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon a political adviser with no direct national security role to full membership and downgrades the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The alteration was contained in a memorandum issued late Saturday defining the organization of the National Security Council and the Homeland Security Council, the top bodies inside the White House on everything from diplomacy to counterterrorism to crisis management to nuclear and cyberpolicy. Mr. Trump's document drew from organizational precedents in the Obama and George W. Bush administrations. But the ascension of Mr. Bannon, who until last year was the head of Breitbart News, and the diminishment of the president's top intelligence and military advisers took Democrats and Republicans by surprise. The new memo said that the intelligence director and the Joint Chiefs chairman would attend the principals meetings? the meeting of officials only when issues pertaining to their responsibilities and expertise are to be discussed. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said Sunday that Mr. Bannon's past service as a Navy officer merited his attendance at all meetings, as part of a streamlining? of . He did not explain the downgrading of the general who heads the Joint Chiefs, Joseph F. Dunford Jr. who rose through the Marine Corps and served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Well, he is a former naval officer, Mr. Spicer said of Mr. Bannon on ABC's This Week. He's got a tremendous understanding of the world and the geopolitical landscape that we have now. He added, Having the chief strategist for the president in those meetings, who has a significant military background, to help make, guide what the president's final analysis is going to be, is crucial. When pressed on General Dunford's role, Mr. Spicer said, The president gets plenty of information from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Current and former military officials said they suspected that the decision, in part, was prompted by the national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, who retired as a general after he was dismissed during the Obama administration as the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. It was the previous director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper, who delivered the news to Mr. Flynn that he was being removed from his post. Throughout the transition, Mr. Flynn was reportedly hesitant to place many people around the National Security Council table who had outranked him in the military. Nonetheless, there are two in the cabinet: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who retired as a general, and the secretary of homeland security, John F. Kelly, a retired Marine Corps general who served for 45 years, ending his military career as the commander of United States Southern Command. Both men remain principals on the council. The C. I. A. director, Mike Pompeo, is not mentioned at all in the reorganization order. A week ago, Mr. Trump went to",6.298258
106,35,What role did Steve Bannon receive in the National Security Council?,2,18122,"not like he has broad experience in foreign policy and national security issues. He doesn't. His primary role is to control or guide the president's conscience based on his campaign promises. That's not what the National Security Council is supposed to be about. That opinion was shared by President George W. Bush's last chief of staff, Josh Bolten, who barred Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's political adviser, from N. S. C. meetings. A president's decisions made with those advisers, he told a conference audience in September, involve life and death for the people in uniform? and should not be tainted by any political decisions. Susan E. Rice, President Barack Obama's last national security adviser, called the arrangement stone cold crazy? in a tweet posted Sunday. Mr. Spicer said the language the Trump White House used in its N. S. C. executive order is, with the exception of Mr. Bannon's position which was created during the transition almost identical in content to one the Bush administration drafted in 2001. And Mr. Obama's top political operative, David Axelrod, sat in on some N. S. C. meetings, he added. There were key differences. Mr. Axelrod never served as a permanent member as Mr. Bannon will now, though he sat in on some critical meetings, especially as Mr. Obama debated strategy in Afghanistan and Pakistan. It's a profound shift, Mr. Axelrod said. I don't know what his bona fides are to be the principal foreign policy adviser to the president. But Mr. Bannon's elevation does not merely reflect his growing influence on national security. It is emblematic of Mr. Trump's trust on a range of political and ideological issues. During the campaign, the sly and provocative Mr. Bannon played a paradoxical role calming the easily agitated candidate during his frequent rough patches and egging him on when he felt Mr. Trump needed to fire up the white base. The president respects Mr. Bannon because he is independently wealthy and therefore does not need the job, and both men ascribe to a credo when put on the defensive, according to the former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. Mr. Bannon is a deft operator within the White House, and he has been praised by Republicans who view him skeptically as the most knowledgeable on policy around the president. But his stated preference for blowing things up as opposed to putting them back together may not translate to his new role. The hasty drafting of the immigration order, and its scattershot execution, brought a measure of Mr. Bannon's chaotic and hyperaggressive political style to the more predictable administration of the federal government. Within hours of the edict, airport customs and border agents were detaining or blocking dozens of migrant families, some of whom had permanent resident status, until John F. Kelly, the new homeland security secretary, intervened. Mr. Kelly's department had suggested green card holders be exempted from the order, but Mr. Bannon and Mr. Miller, a on immigration, overruled him, according to two American officials.

107,35,What role did Steve Bannon receive in the National Security Council?,3,18122,"WASHINGTON The whirlwind first week of Donald J. Trump's presidency had all the bravura hallmarks of a Stephen K. Bannon production. It started with the inauguration homily to American carnage? in United States cities by Mr. Bannon, followed a few days later by his shut up? message to the news media. The week culminated with a blizzard of executive orders, mostly hatched by Mr. Bannon's team and the White House policy adviser, Stephen Miller, aimed at disorienting the enemy, fulfilling campaign promises and distracting attention from Mr. Trump's less than flawless debut. But the defining moment for Mr. Bannon came Saturday night in the form of an executive order giving the rumpled agitator a full seat on the principals committee? of the National Security Council while downgrading the roles of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the director of national intelligence, who will now attend only when the council is considering issues in their direct areas of responsibilities. It is a startling elevation of a political adviser, to a status alongside the secretaries of state and defense, and over the president's top military and intelligence advisers. In theory, the move put Mr. Bannon, a former Navy surface warfare officer, admiral's aide, investment banker, Hollywood producer and Breitbart News firebrand, on the same level as his friend, Michael T. Flynn, the national security adviser, a former Pentagon intelligence chief who was Mr. Trump's top adviser on national security issues before a series of missteps reduced his influence. But in terms of real influence, Mr. Bannon looms above almost everyone except the president's Jared Kushner, in the Trumpian pecking order, according to interviews with two dozen Trump insiders and current and former national security officials. The move involving Mr. Bannon, as well as the boost in status to the White House homeland security adviser, Thomas P. Bossert, and Mr. Trump's relationships with cabinet appointees like Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, have essentially layered over Mr. Flynn. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said Mr. Bannon whose Breitbart website was a magnet for white nationalists, antiglobalists and conspiracy theorists always planned to participate in national security. Mr. Flynn welcomed his participation, Mr. Spicer said, but the general led the reorganization of the N. S. C. in order to streamline an antiquated and bloated bureaucracy. Former White House officials in both parties were shocked by the move. The last place you want to put somebody who worries about politics is in a room where they're talking about national security, said Leon E. Panetta, a former White House chief of staff, defense secretary and C. I. A. director in two Democratic administrations. I've never seen that happen, and it shouldn't happen. It's not like he has broad experience in foreign policy and national security issues. He doesn't. His primary role is to control or guide the president's conscience based on his campaign promises. That's not what the National Security Council is supposed to be about. That opinion was shared by President George",4.7567406
108,36,What did President Trump emphasize in his Inaugural Address?,1,17814,"WASHINGTON America, and the world, just found out what America First? means. President Trump could have used his inaugural address to define one of the touchstone phrases of his campaign in the most inclusive way, arguing, as did many of his predecessors, that as the world's greatest superpower rises, its partners will also prosper. Instead, he chose a dark, alternative, one that appeared to herald the end of a American experiment to shape a world that would be eager to follow its lead. In Mr. Trump's vision, America's new strategy is to win every transaction and confrontation. Gone are the days, he said, when America extended its defensive umbrella without compensation, or spent billions to try to lift the fortune of foreign nations, with no strategic benefits for the United States. From this day forward, it's going to be only America first, he said, in a line that resonated around the world as soon as he uttered it from the steps of the Capitol. We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs. The United States, he said, will no longer subsidize the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military. While all American presidents pledge to defend America's interests first that is the core of the presidential oath presidents of both parties since the end of World War II have wrapped that effort in an expansion of the liberal democratic order. Until today, American policy has been a complete rejection of the America First rallying cry that the famed flier Charles Lindbergh championed when, in the late 1930s, he became one of the most prominent voices to keep the United States out of Europe's wars, even if it meant abandoning the country's closest allies. Mr. Trump has rejected comparisons with the earlier movement, with its taint of Nazism and . After World War II, the United States buried the Lindbergh vision of America First. The United Nations was born in San Francisco and raised on the East River of Manhattan, an ambitious, if still unfulfilled, experiment in shaping a liberal order. Lifting the vanquished nations of World War II into democratic allies was the idea behind the Marshall Plan, the creation of the World Bank and institutions to spread American aid, technology and expertise around the world. And NATO was created to instill a commitment to common defense, though Mr. Trump has accurately observed that nearly seven decades later, many of its member nations do not pull their weight. Mr. Trump's defiant address made abundantly clear that his threat to pull out of those institutions, if they continue to take advantage of the United States? willingness to subsidize them, could soon be translated into policy. All those decades of generosity, he said, punching the air for emphasis, had turned America into a loser. We've made other countries rich, he said, while the wealth, strength and confidence of our country has disappeared",6.1702166
109,36,What did President Trump emphasize in his Inaugural Address?,2,17809,"How much do Inaugural Addresses matter? Many are memorable and continue to be quoted, while most others are forgotten almost immediately. Donald J. Trump will get his chance shortly after noon Friday. They are a touching, almost na've attempt to set a tone for what is to come, Jon Meacham, the presidential biographer, said. But as we know, and as is often remarked, events are in the saddle. We are not. Some of history's most notable inaugural speeches, including the first of Abraham Lincoln, in 1861, demonstrated that presidents cannot control the tides of history. But even so, the most memorable ones stand as worthy introductions to the presidents who delivered them, their values and their goals. George Washington | Thursday, April 30, 1789 The first Inaugural Address was characterized by the first president's impressive humility. Professing himself to feel unworthy of the task, and praising God, George Washington used the speech, which James Madison helped him to draft, to declare his faith in Congress's ability to govern. The magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies, he said, essentially announcing his skepticism and fear at not living up to the task. But while he declined to offer any specific legislation to Congress, as was his right under the new Constitution, he did subtly remind the legislative body of its duty toward the new country, asking that the foundation of our national policy will be laid in the pure and immutable principles of private morality, and the of free government be exemplified by all the attributes which can win the affections of its citizens and command the respect of the world. Then, before praising God at length for a final time, Washington announced that he would decline any financial compensation for taking on the role of president. Andrew Jackson | Wednesday, March 4, 1829 President Jackson was one of the originators of American populism and, fittingly, his Inaugural Address paid tribute to his supporters, the people. While the magnitude of their interests convinces me that no thanks can be adequate to the honor they have conferred, it admonishes me that the best return I can make is the zealous dedication of my humble abilities to their service and their good, he said. Jackson's speech stands as a notable example of the gulf that can exist between rhetoric and action. He pledged to respect the limits of executive power (which he ended up expanding) and expressed his sincere and constant desire? to be humane and considerate regarding Native American rights. He signed the Indian Removal Act, which expelled tens of thousands of Native Americans from their native homes, into law the following May. Jackson, who",5.5012903
110,36,What did President Trump emphasize in his Inaugural Address?,3,17813,"WASHINGTON Donald John Trump was inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States on Friday, ushering in a new era that he vowed would shatter the established order and reverse a national decline that he called this American carnage. In a ceremony that capped a remarkable rise to power, Mr. Trump presented himself as the leader of a populist uprising to restore lost greatness. He outlined a dark vision of an America afflicted by the ravages? of economic dislocation and foreign exploitation, requiring his approach to turn around. I will fight for you with every breath in my body, and I will never, ever let you down, Mr. Trump told hundreds of thousands of admirers and onlookers in a forceful Inaugural Address from the West Front of the Capitol. America will start winning again, winning like never before. We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams. Mr. Trump's ascension amounted to a hostile takeover of a capital facing its most significant disruption in generations. While officially a Republican, he has taken on leaders of both parties and, with no prior political career of his own, made clear that he saw himself as the ultimate outsider not beholden to the current system. We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action, constantly complaining but never doing anything about it, he said. The time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action. Do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done. Mr. Trump's view of the United States was strikingly grim for an Inaugural Address a country where mothers and children are trapped in poverty in our inner cities, where factories? are scattered like tombstones across the landscape? and where drugs and crime have stolen too many lives. This American carnage, he declared, stops right here and stops right now. He got started right away with rolling back the policies of his predecessor, former President Barack Obama, by issuing orders freezing new regulations from recent weeks and ordering agencies to ease the burden? of the Affordable Care Act during the transition from repealing to replacing the law. More orders are planned for next week. Wearing a dark suit and red tie and accompanied by his wife, Melania, in a suit and matching gloves, Mr. Trump took the oath administered by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. precisely at noon. Michael Richard Pence, a former governor and congressman from Indiana, was sworn in minutes before as vice president by Justice Clarence Thomas. Mr. Trump assumed the presidency of a country still unsettled after a polarizing election and entered office with less support in polls than any other president in recent history. It was clear from the day that there would be no grace period either for or by the new president. The Senate confirmed two cabinet nominations James N.
