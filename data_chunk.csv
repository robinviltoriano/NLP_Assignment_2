173131,"The body of the Iraqi prisoner was found naked and badly bruised in 2003, outside a detention center in southern Iraq run by United States Marines. The man had been beaten, deprived of sleep, forced to stand for long periods and interrogated by Marines about his alleged role in a fatal ambush of American forces. James N. Mattis, Donald J. Trump's nominee for secretary of defense, was then a major general and the commander of the Marine division in Iraq responsible for the center. He quickly convened an inquiry into the death, which led to and banned the harsh techniques used at the prison. General Mattis was all up in arms over this, Ralph Dengler, then a lieutenant colonel, testified at a military hearing in January 2004. He added that the commander, who arrived hours after the discovery on a planned visit with his British counterpart, had immediately described the death as the worst thing that happened? under his watch in the Iraq war. I was surprised that he would have felt that strongly about it, considering many of the other deaths, including American deaths, Colonel Dengler said. Colleagues say the general's handling of the episode reflects his firmly held views against torture and prisoner mistreatment, which are shared by many military leaders and could put them at odds with the new commander in chief. Mr. Trump, in a New York Times interview in late November, said he had been surprised to learn that the man he was considering to lead the country's 2. 2 million service members did not believe in torture. During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump advocated bringing back the practice of waterboarding, adding that only a stupid person would say it doesn't work. General Mattis does not support abusive techniques, let alone waterboarding. Give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers, he told Mr. Trump during their meeting in November, according to the and I do better with that than I do with torture. The general's beliefs were shaped by his military training, but also by his experiences in dealing with issues related to torture or mistreatment, according to an examination of his nearly career and interviews with former colleagues and friends. General Mattis led the United States Central Command from August 2010 to March 2013. Lt. Col. T. G. Taylor, who was General Mattis's spokesman during much of that time, said in an interview that the commander had spoken of America as needing to hold the moral high ground. Failing to uphold important principles makes it easier for a soldier or a Marine to ask, What am I fighting for? Colonel Taylor said. That is something that General Mattis is keenly aware of, he added. As a young officer, General Mattis would have been instructed in the laws of war, including the Geneva Conventions, which, among other protections, require humane treatment of prisoners of war.

As a young officer, General Mattis would have been instructed in the laws of war, including the Geneva Conventions, which, among other protections, require humane treatment of prisoners of war. A Marine who enlisted in 1969 while attending college part of an R. O. T. C. program during the height of the Vietnam War he did not deploy to Vietnam. But, several friends say, he believed that American prisoners of war were more likely to be tortured by the Vietcong if the United States tortured enemy captives. In 2006, General Mattis supported Gen. David H. Petraeus of the Army and other military leaders in the development of a new counterinsurgency field manual that highlighted limits on interrogation tactics. Torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment is never a morally permissible option, even if lives depend on gaining information, the manual said. Lose moral legitimacy, lose the war. General Mattis later agreed in a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing that it was inappropriate for the military to support the use of abusive techniques on detainees including waterboarding, forced nudity and sensory deprivation, tactics inflicted on prisoners during interrogations in secret C. I. A. prisons in the years after the 2001 terrorist attacks. Those techniques had been modeled on a military training program operated by the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency, which later fell under the general's command. That program, Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape, also known as SERE, exposed United States soldiers and other service members to techniques that an enemy violating the laws of war might use so that Americans could be better prepared to resist them. The experience typically led trainees to conclude that tortured prisoners of war will say whatever they need to in order to stay alive, whether true or not. A recent investigation by The New York Times found that many terrorism suspects subjected to harsh tactics in C. I. A. jails or American military prisons had lasting mental health problems that were similar to those experienced by some American former P. O. W.s who suffered horrific abuses in Vietnam or Korea. As a commander in Afghanistan and later in Iraq, and as an overall leader of the American war effort, General Mattis often grappled with the consequences of the C. I. A. s treatment of prisoners and the harsh conditions at the military detention center at Guantnamo Bay, Cuba. They became a powerful recruiting tool for jihadis who threatened American forces in the field. Testifying at a Senate hearing in 2015 after his retirement, General Mattis opposed the release, before the end of hostilities, of prisoners who had fought against the United States. However, he added, they should be treated humanely, in accordance with international and domestic law. I would go by the Geneva Conventions, and maintain them, with Red Cross oversight, until the war is over, he told lawmakers. Torture is not effective in eliciting intelligence, the general felt.

Torture is not effective in eliciting intelligence, the general felt. For his whole career, he's believed that it just doesn't pay dividends, said a retired senior United States military officer who is close to General Mattis but spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of alienating Mr. Trump. The pack of cigarettes? reference, according to people who served with the general, reflects two tenets that are drummed into future military leaders: that information gleaned from torture is unreliable, and that can go a long way. I'm not in his head, but what General Mattis was saying is that offering a modicum of friendship and humanity to someone in a desperate situation is more successful than physical torture, Colonel Taylor said. Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump's transition team, declined requests for more detail on the s discussions with General Mattis or on the source of General Mattis's beliefs and any further thoughts Mr. Trump has had about the use of torture. General Mattis declined to be interviewed. Many American military leaders maintain that the Bush administration's departure from established practices in allowing harsh coercive techniques government lawyers had said they did not meet the legal definition of torture, and had declared that detainees were not protected by the Geneva Conventions tainted the United States? reputation while not yielding results. Ineffective, war crime, against our values, moral high ground, et cetera, Donald J. Guter, a retired rear admiral and the dean of the South Texas College of Law, said in explaining objections to brutal treatment. A very practical reason is that it opens the door for our own troops to be tortured, and we have no basis to object. If we torture, we've lost who we are. The Department of Defense has clear policies on the humane treatment of detainees. For example, the Army field manual's section on intelligence collection states: Use of torture is not only illegal but also it is a poor technique that yields unreliable results. The manual adds, Cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment is prohibited. As a commander in Iraq, General Mattis ordered several investigations into detainee abuse. One of the most significant concerned the 2003 death at a makeshift detention and interrogation center in an abandoned Iraqi Army barracks in southern Iraq, christened Camp Whitehorse. Prisoners were held by United States Marine reservists in extreme heat in a dirty, stone building that had been looted of all amenities by Iraqis during the invasion. The prisoner who died, Nagem Sadoon Hatab, had been arrested days earlier on suspicion of involvement in a deadly ambush of a United States Army convoy that led to the capture of Jessica Lynch, a private who was later rescued. Mr. Hatab was alleged to have killed American service members and sold an rifle taken from one of them. Mr. Hatab failed to stand"
173134,"of involvement in a deadly ambush of a United States Army convoy that led to the capture of Jessica Lynch, a private who was later rescued. Mr. Hatab was alleged to have killed American service members and sold an rifle taken from one of them. Mr. Hatab failed to stand up while being subjected to treatment forced standing for 50 minutes of each hour, for up to 10 hours. The objective was to make the detainees tired, stressed and submissive for interrogators, witnesses later said in military court hearings. Like other prisoners at the center, Mr. Hatab was hooded and his hands were restrained behind his back with plastic ties. He was beaten severely by Marine guards after refusing to comply with the forced standing and . He also underwent questioning by a special Marine interrogation squad. A Marine guard later testified that he had often heard yelling, screaming and banging from the interrogation room, a converted bathroom. After midnight on June 6, 2003, Mr. Hatab was found dead in a courtyard where he had been left lying for hours, his body covered in his own feces. An armed forces medical examiner categorized the death as a homicide. Mr. Hatab had six broken ribs and had suffocated from a broken bone in his throat after being dragged outside by his neck, the examiner concluded. Eight Camp Whitehorse personnel were charged with crimes, including negligent homicide. But the investigator appointed by General Mattis, Col. William B. Gallo, later cited problems with the autopsy and could not determine which of the attacks on Mr. Hatab, if any, might have been lethal. In Colonel Gallo's opinion, the treatment did not amount to torture, but the command had failed to provide adequate predeployment training in handling prisoners and in the law of war. Evidence, including certain photographs of the prisoner and a summary of an interrogation he underwent, had been lost or destroyed, complicating the investigation and prosecution. Two Marines, a major and a sergeant, were eventually convicted of lesser charges. Mr. Hatab's death clearly had an effect on General Mattis. According to reports at the time, he ordered a review of the procedures for handling prisoners, which resulted in a ban of tactics, including the forced standing. Marine Corps personnel running detention camps were given more training, and a manual was compiled to explain each step of the process. Still, there were several other instances of prisoner abuse involving the division. Later, aiming to earn the trust of the Iraqi people after the first phase of combat had ended, General Mattis added an addendum to the motto of his Marines: No better friend, no worse enemy. The addition was, First, do no harm."
175451,"DETROIT Just before the holidays, on a dark street a few blocks from downtown, a group of public officials crowded onto a makeshift stage before a shivering crowd, flipped a big switch and the last of this city's 65, 000 new streetlights blazed on. For years, urban decline here was encapsulated in headlines about Detroit's lights going out. Nowadays, tales of the city's slow recovery tend to focus on plucky hipsters from Los Angeles or Brooklyn colonizing abandoned spaces, opening pickle companies or tilling little urban agriculture plots. Glossy magazines acclaim Detroit as the next Berlin never mind that Germany's reunified capital has always floated on a bed of cushy federal subsidies. Let's hope that if anyone writes a history of Detroit's rejuvenation, a chapter is devoted to the lights returning. Like picking up the trash, fixing potholes and responding to emergencies, these efforts signal that no matter where you live in Detroit, you are no longer forgotten that government here can finally keep its basic promises. The city, postbankruptcy, is led by Mike Duggan, a strong mayor. Its most solid indicator of progress may come this year, with the release of census figures, Mr. Duggan told me. After generations of white and black flight, there's hope the numbers will reveal, for the first time in decades, the population holding steady or even rising. So far, much news about growth has focused on downtown, where Dan Gilbert, the billionaire owner of Quicken Loans, is a vocal booster, and on Midtown, home to businesses like the luxury brand Shinola. A light rail under construction will soon link the two neighborhoods, doubling down on their redevelopment. All that said, Detroit is a large city with limited resources. It sprawls across 139 square miles (two and a half times the size of Miami) a preponderance of which remain blighted and empty, with few prospects for prosperity. I made a pilgrimage to Sister Pie, a cozy corner bakery opened a few years ago by a gifted Brooklyn transplant in the troubled West Village area, where more new shops and restaurants have lately settled. West Village is being advertised as another pocket of resurgence. You sometimes even hear the G word gentrification bandied around. But drive a block or so from Sister Pie and you'll still find street after street of houses. This is where the new lights come in. They're spread all across town. The project cost $185 million, paid by the city and the state. The Public Lighting Authority of Detroit, backed by the mayor, received a critical assist from the Obama administration: Energy Department experts advised local officials to swap out the old, costly, sodium lamps, which vandals had been stripping bare for copper wire. They recommended LED technology. Investments by the Obama administration in lighting have reduced costs, making LEDs feasible for a city like Detroit. Three years ago, nearly half the 88, 000 streetlights in the city were out of commission. The more potent LED lights allow the authority to"

Three years ago, nearly half the 88, 000 streetlights in the city were out of commission. The more potent LED lights allow the authority to replace those 88, 000 old fixtures with 65, 000 new ones, strong enough for you to read one of those glossy magazines after dark. The whole thing came in under budget and on time. When was the last time anyone could say that about a major infrastructure project in Detroit? An example of how good government should work, as Lorna L. Thomas, chairwoman of the lighting authority, put it at the ceremony. It's also an example of how one smart decision can have ripple effects. Some residents here grumbled about fewer lights. That said, the stronger new ones turn out to save Detroit nearly $3 million in electric bills. They use aluminum wiring, which nobody wants to strip, discouraging crime. The technology even cuts carbon emissions by more than 40, 000 tons a year equivalent to taking 11, 000 cars off of your streets, Shaun Donovan, Mr. Obama's director of the Office of Management and Budget, pointed out at the lighting event, as well as putting more money in the city's pockets to do more good things. Good things like investing in development beyond the core. I met with the city's new planning and housing chiefs, who outlined a bold agenda to target dense areas, like the one around Livernois Avenue, between Seven Mile Road and Eight Mile Road, the city's former luxury fashion district. Homegrown entrepreneurs like Rufus Bartell, catering to a young, more population, are reviving the avenue. Mr. Bartell and his family have opened nearly a dozen businesses along Livernois, including Kuzzo's Chicken Waffles, where he and I convened one recent morning over breakfast. The place was mobbed, as usual. Businesses like Kuzzo's pretty much had to shut down by dinnertime during the winter when the lights were out, Mr. Bartell told me. People didn't want to go out to eat or shop after the sun went down, he said. He gestured out the window toward a shop across the street. I own a store that sells furs and leather goods, with a customer base that skews older. Foot traffic almost fell to zero after dark. Since the lights came on, it's up 15 percent across this neighborhood. Back at Sister Pie, I talked with Shannon Smith, 26, another Detroit native, who said he had grown up in Cody Rouge, an area on the northwest side of the city where getting to and from the bus stop as a teenager was a nightmare when streetlights failed. He and other schoolchildren all across town waited in the dark for buses that often didn't arrive on schedule. I was especially vulnerable whenever it snowed, because the city didn't clear the sidewalks, Mr. Smith recalled. City officials told me that"
175453,"as a teenager was a nightmare when streetlights failed. He and other schoolchildren all across town waited in the dark for buses that often didn't arrive on schedule. I was especially vulnerable whenever it snowed, because the city didn't clear the sidewalks, Mr. Smith recalled. City officials told me that since 2014, using federal Department of Transportation funding, Detroit has added 80 buses, hired dozens of drivers and increased ridership by approximately 100, 000 trips a week. Buses are critical to bringing together the areas of newly targeted development. It's one of the cruel (many here say racist) burdens of life in Detroit that automobile insurance rates for city residents are through the roof many can't afford a car. Like the streetlights, buses restore the fabric of the streets and a base line of normalcy. I made one last stop, at Louisiana Creole Gumbo, a restaurant near downtown. Joe Spencer has owned Louisiana Creole since the early 1980s. It catered to neighborhood workers before drug dealers moved in and the lights went out. Now the lights are on, Mr. Spencer said, and diners are returning at night. But more important, he said, the lights demonstrate that City Hall followed through on a promise: Residents stopped trusting government, and without trust people won't want to settle here or start a business. The mayor said he'd turn the lights back on. He did. Among ripple effects, trust may be the most invaluable. As I said, one smart design move."
183371,"HOUSTON The chants rang out loud and long at NRG Stadium in South Texas, not from bars or living rooms across New England, until a wall of sound enveloped a team and a quarterback on a mission. Brady, Brady, the fans screamed, and it is in moments like this the first overtime in Super Bowl history that Tom Brady appears most comfortable, as if lounging on his sofa in his beloved Uggs. In each of his previous four Super Bowl victories, Brady guided drives for the Patriots. However sublime, those efforts against the Rams, the Panthers, the Eagles and the Seahawks all seemed quaint before Sunday night. That is when Brady again summoned the sorcery of his right arm to stun the Atlanta Falcons in what is undoubtedly the greatest late surge in a Super Bowl. When James White sneaked into the end zone from 2 yards away, completing a victory that defied the bounds of credulity and secured the Patriots? fifth title, his teammates stormed onto the field, flung their helmets and hugged anyone who moved. Across the field, the Falcons watched from their sideline as if fossilized in amber, too exhausted and dumbstruck to move. The Patriots trailed by 25 points with 2 minutes 12 seconds remaining in the third quarter and by 19 with 9:48 left in regulation and they won. They won because of Dont'a Hightower's critical and Julian Edelman's Velcro hands and the clock management and coaching of a maestro, Bill Belichick, but mostly because of a truism that has beleaguered the league's other 31 teams for 16 years running: the Patriots have Brady, and no one else does, not even the Falcons, who boasted the N. F. L. s most valuable player in Matt Ryan. Super Bowl LI Box Score Not including their possession at the end of regulation, the Patriots, after mustering only a field goal on their first seven drives, scored on their final five possessions. At halftime, I would say we weren't down at all, Brady said. We were disappointed in the way we played, and we knew that we could go out and do a lot better in the second half. Brady completed 43 of 62 passes for 466 yards, with two touchdowns and an interception, a performance that earned him Super Bowl M. V. P. honors for the fourth time in his career. In none of the other three instances did he handle a season as challenging as this, from the illness plaguing his mother, Galynn, to the suspension served for his role in that protracted saga known as Deflategate, after the underinflated footballs meant to give him a throwing advantage. In accepting the Vince Lombardi Trophy from Commissioner Roger Goodell, who meted out the punishment, the owner Robert K. Kraft did not outright address the scandal. But he did allude it to it in perhaps the strongest possible terms. A lot has transpired in the last two years, and I don't think that needs any explanation, Kraft said."
183372,"Roger Goodell, who meted out the punishment, the owner Robert K. Kraft did not outright address the scandal. But he did allude it to it in perhaps the strongest possible terms. A lot has transpired in the last two years, and I don't think that needs any explanation, Kraft said. Because of that, he said, this title is unequivocally the sweetest. His reputation sullied, Brady embarked on a nationwide tour of vindication that reached its climax in the venue where he won his second Super Bowl, back in February 2004, long before the Patriots achieved modern dynasty status in an era designed to encourage parity. Brady was 26 then, and it is possible that he is now superior in all facets, six months shy of his 40th birthday, at an age when most of his peers have either retired or entered a noticeable decline. By going during his suspension, the Patriots created the farcical perception that they no longer needed him that quarterbacks in New England's ruthless machinery are interchangeable, even Brady. He turbocharged the Patriots? offense with 33 touchdowns to four interceptions heading into Sunday, when he toiled, misfiring wide and long, until late in the third quarter. Powered by three touchdowns in a 9:54 span of the second quarter, Atlanta led by with 10 minutes left before the Patriots unleashed 10 minutes of mayhem. Hightower's catalyzed the comeback, with Brady capitalizing on excellent field position to find Danny Amendola from 6 yards out. Less than 6 minutes remained, and though the Falcons advanced deep into New England territory, a holding penalty knocked them out of range, forcing them to punt. This might be the appropriate point to note the travails of the Falcons franchise. Their woeful inaugural season of 1966, completed weeks before the first Super Bowl, presaged Atlanta's struggles for the next . It took more than a decade for the Falcons to reach the playoffs, more than three to advance to a conference championship and more than four to stack consecutive winning seasons. The Falcons traded Brett Favre and had a coach, Bobby Petrino, notify players that he was quitting by leaving notes at their lockers. The only other time Atlanta reached the Super Bowl, in January 1999, one of its best defensive players, Eugene Robinson, was arrested for soliciting a prostitute the night before. They have lost far more than they won, endured more agony than ecstasy and been lampooned for everything from their attendance to their uniforms, and for all those reasons and more a city that had not claimed a champion since the Braves won the World Series in 1995 was ready to celebrate with abandon once more. But first, Brady. He still had to contend with a defense overseen by the Falcons? coach, Dan Quinn, who nearly foiled him two years ago, when he worked in Seattle. For all of Belichick's experience, Quinn had coached in more Super Bowls recently, three in the last four seasons. The memory of that loss to"
183373,"had to contend with a defense overseen by the Falcons? coach, Dan Quinn, who nearly foiled him two years ago, when he worked in Seattle. For all of Belichick's experience, Quinn had coached in more Super Bowls recently, three in the last four seasons. The memory of that loss to New England still smolders for Quinn, who from that game remembers not the interception by Malcolm Butler, but how the Seahawks went ahead to stay with about two minutes left. Quinn may never again coach a defense as fast and physical words emblazoned on a bracelet he has worn as Seattle's, but for the first three quarters on Sunday, the Falcons harassed Brady, swarmed the ball and created turnovers, converting both of New England's mistakes before halftime into 14 points. Most obvious was the Falcons? speed advantage, and how, as Quinn's Seahawks did against Denver in the 2014 game, they parlayed it into momentum. Robert Alford's interception return for a touchdown, the return in a Super Bowl, had the same effect on the Patriots as Malcolm Smith's for Seattle three years ago. And that, to an extent, was part of the plan Quinn toted along with him to Atlanta, whose ascension under him began with an evolved way of thinking forged by his time in Seattle: He wanted his players to work as hard as they ever have but have a great time doing it. The Super Bowl was enjoyable, until it wasn't. That's a hard one in the locker room, Quinn said. No place to put that one mentally for us. One of the Patriots? underappreciated assets during their dominant stretch has been their resilience, which seems odd given how rarely they tend to lose, or even trail. They fell behind Sunday for the first time since Week 12 against the Jets. But the ethos cultivated by Belichick demands an uncommon fortitude. Those who cannot handle the atmosphere are weeded out like overwhelmed med students. Belichick built this reputation by twice smothering prolific offenses in Super Bowls the 1990 Bills, when he coordinated the Giants? unit, and the 2001 Rams, in the championship that launched New England's dynasty. As potent as that Rams team was, it actually averaged fewer points and fewer yards per play during the season, and committed 33 more turnovers, than these Falcons. Scoring 80 points across two playoff victories emboldened Atlanta running back Devonta Freeman to call the Falcons? offense unstoppable. Except that the Patriots did, in fact, stop Atlanta on all four possessions, empowering Brady with two timeouts and 3:30 left, chasing an deficit. They marched 91 yards on a drive extended by a reception by Edelman as absurd as the comeback itself, one that evoked so many catches of past New England Super Bowls. Only this time, instead of watching opponents do the impossible David Tyree hugging the ball against his helmet or Mario Manningham tiptoeing along the sideline or Jermaine Kearse contorting himself it was the Patriots who amazed.

Only this time, instead of watching opponents do the impossible David Tyree hugging the ball against his helmet or Mario Manningham tiptoeing along the sideline or Jermaine Kearse contorting himself it was the Patriots who amazed. While falling, Edelman caught a tipped pass, then dropped it, then cradled the ball just before it would have touched the ground. It was one of the greatest catches I've ever seen, Brady said. I don't know how the hell he caught it. I mean, I don't think anybody I don't think he does. It only mattered that he did, and after White scored with 57 seconds left and Danny Amendola converted the tying conversion, the Patriots called heads, won the coin toss and never let Atlanta touch the ball again. Only with a cleareyed view of these last five months, after the completion of another N. F. L. season, can it now be said: The anxiety, anger and exasperation that pervaded New England for months, after the scandal that cost the Patriots their sainted quarterback for a spell and dented their reputation none of it mattered. The Patriots reached the final game, just as they thought they would. And they won, just as they thought they would all along, even if they never could have conjured how they did it. Brady and the Patriots were down for much of Sunday night, but they reappeared in the fourth quarter. And now, after Sunday, after winning yet another Super Bowl, he struck a familiar pose: holding the Lombardi Trophy as confetti fell."
183391,"Picking the pain reliever that's best for you can be a confusing task. Pharmacy and supermarket shelves are lined with a dizzying array of boxes, names and labels describing the symptoms the medications are intended to address. While they all share the same goal, making you feel better, their active ingredients vary, and all have potential drawbacks. Dr. Robert A. Duarte, director of the Pain Center at Northwell Health in Great Neck, N. Y. cautioned that consumers should not be lulled into thinking that pain relievers are free from potential harm just because they are available on store shelves. Sales of medications exceeded $30 billion in 2015, with pain relievers ranking near the top, according to industry statistics. Consumers need to be informed about what they are taking, and in what doses. A survey conducted in 2001 for the National Council on Patient Information and Education found that only of those polled could identify the active ingredient in their pain reliever. A similar fraction of consumers said they had taken more than the recommended dose of nonprescription medication because they believed it would increase its effectiveness. Dr. Sadiah Siddiqui, an anesthesiologist specializing in interventional pain medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine in Manhattan, said consumers need to read the labels of the medications for their active ingredients. Those who take any kind of pain reliever around the clock for a week or more should see a specialist or their doctor, she added. Here are the major categories of nonprescription pain relievers and some of what you should know about them: Common brand name: Tylenol Recommended to treat: Headaches, pain and fever Potential side effects:The Food and Drug Administration recommends a maximum of 4, 000 milligrams per day. Exceeding that level can mean the liver has to work harder. Clinicians recommend a daily maximum dose of 3, 000 if it is taken for an extended period. What else you should know: Concerns about potential liver damage from taking acetaminophen have been clouded over time, Dr. Duarte said. The warnings surfaced because patients were taking Tylenol with other medications or prescriptions that also contained acetaminophen. For instance, the prescription painkiller Percocet and cold and flu remedies have Tylenol in them. When patients take those drugs as well as Tylenol, they can unwittingly get higher doses of acetaminophen than they should, he said. You may not think you are taking that much Tylenol, but yes you are, he said. Common brand names: Advil, Motrin Recommended to treat: Arthritic, joint and dental pain and headaches Potential side effects: Stomach bleeding and kidney problems are risks, particularly for patients who are 60 or older, Dr. Duarte said. What else you should know: Ibuprofen is an that combats prostaglandins, the chemicals associated with pain such as menstrual cramps, joint pain and headaches that are released in the body.

It is also found in Excedrin. Recommended to treat: Headaches and pain from inflammation. It is also used to prevent strokes and promote heart health. Potential side effects: Gastric bleeding and kidney dysfunction children up to their years should not take aspirin because it is linked to Reye syndrome, which causes brain and liver damage. What else you should know: When it comes to Excedrin and Excedrin for migraines, opt for the less expensive basic product because they both have the same active ingredients, Dr. Duarte said, adding, Don't be fooled by packaging. In general, he said, regardless of what product you take, don't think that if some is good, more is better. If you have an underlying history of headaches and you are regularly taking pain relievers, you can be at risk of a rebound headache? caused by the drugs wearing off and the onset of another headache. Some natural products, such as magnesium (400 to 600 milligrams a day) or riboflavin (400 milligrams a day) or using aromatherapy with peppermint oil can help with migraines and muscle pain, he said. Patients should discuss all the medications they take with their doctor. A simple in fact, has risks just the way a prescription does, Dr. Duarte said. A lot of the patients don't take these medications seriously."
