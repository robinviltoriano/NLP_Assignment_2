But her voice begins to falter when she talks about her own life how years of exploitation shattered her confidence and turned her life upside down. For many years, I couldn't talk about being an addict, she said. I couldn't talk about being imprisoned. I couldn't talk about getting on my feet, getting my life back, getting my children back. She paused to fight back tears. I could not talk about that part of me where I was victimized. But having realized that airline employees are perfectly positioned to stop human traffickers and their victims in transit, Ms. Hubbard has found her mission: teaching other flight attendants to spot and report cases of human trafficking. The nonprofit organization she joined in 2015, Airline Ambassadors International, trains workers at airlines and airports how to spot, and report, cases of human trafficking. It also delivers humanitarian aid around the world and transports sick children who need medical care. It was founded in 1996 by Nancy Rivard, who was then a flight attendant. We just did it on our own as a public service because we had the personnel, Ms. Rivard said, noting that the organization began focusing on human trafficking in 2009 and has held 52 training sessions in the United States and abroad since 2011. There were 8, 042 reported cases of human trafficking in the United States last year the most ever, according to a report released last week by the nonprofit organization Polaris. Most of those came through calls to the National Human Trafficking Hotline, which was established by the federal government in December 2007 and is operated by Polaris in a partnership. The number of reported cases has been rising every year since the hotline was established. But it is not all bad news, said Bradley Myles, Polaris's chief executive. We don't necessarily want to give the impression that just because we're learning about more cases, the crime is increasing, Mr. Myles said. It's actually possible that the response is getting more sophisticated. Encouragingly, he added, more and more of these reports are coming directly from trafficking victims, which suggests a growing awareness among those who need it most that the hotline exists. Ms. Hubbard sees victim outreach as vital to her work, but she is hesitant to give details about her own ordeal. She entered an arranged marriage at 16, she said, but the worst abuses did not start until her early 20s, when she described being bought and sold, traded and bartered. Usually, the traffickers play on people's ignorance and na'vet?, she said. Traffickers exploit people who are vulnerable. That is part of the lesson she imparts to airline personnel, along with practical advice on how to spot people who may be traveling against their will often young passengers who look disoriented, refuse to make eye contact or act oddly subservient to\n"]}],"source":["print(ans['article'][1])"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":8,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":29236,"status":"ok","timestamp":1711503719093,"user":{"displayName":"Robin Viltoriano","userId":"14074131151689282253"},"user_tz":-630},"id":"m2vn6hq5itNx","outputId":"107bae07-6810-402c-f8ce-cacc1c4f55a2"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["[HumanMessage(content='Who founded Airline Ambassadors International?'),\n"," AIMessage(content=\"I don't know.\"),\n"," HumanMessage(content='Who is Robin Viltoriano from Indonesia?'),\n"," AIMessage(content=\"I don't know.\")]"]},"execution_count":8,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["handle_qa('Who is Robin Viltoriano from Indonesia?')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":24,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":38876,"status":"ok","timestamp":1711506438566,"user":{"displayName":"Robin Viltoriano","userId":"14074131151689282253"},"user_tz":-630},"id":"z_AlbK3BkcPS","outputId":"414d0498-c487-47b3-f15c-5a0142fef5e5"},"outputs":[],"source":["ans = handle_qa(\"What is the title of Vladimir Nabokov's controversial novel published in 1955?\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":10,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>id</th>\n","      <th>article</th>\n","      <th>score</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>181633</td>\n","      <td>the tale of a sordid road trip, Nabokov has Hu...</td>\n","      <td>-1.206638</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>175423</td>\n","      <td>from alone in its willingness to embrace Mr. Y...</td>\n","      <td>-5.651745</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>179581</td>\n","      <td>MOSCOW Russian lawmakers on Wednesday moved to...</td>\n","      <td>-5.792182</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["       id                                            article     score\n","0  181633  the tale of a sordid road trip, Nabokov has Hu... -1.206638\n","1  175423  from alone in its willingness to embrace Mr. Y... -5.651745\n","2  179581  MOSCOW Russian lawmakers on Wednesday moved to... -5.792182"]},"execution_count":10,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["ans = top_k_article(\"What is the title of Vladimir Nabokov's controversial novel published in 1955?\")\n","ans"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":14,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["\"the tale of a sordid road trip, Nabokov has Humbert traveling the country in possession of his illicit love interest. The book is filled with Nabokov's own observations about an America that still felt foreign and exciting to him. Isabel Allende, The House of the Spirits? (1982) Country of origin: ChileReasons for leaving: Allende fled to Venezuela in 1973 after the coup that brought down Salvador Allende, the socialist leader and her father's cousin. She moved to California in the late 1980s. Drawing on the circumstances of her own exile, Allende used her debut novel to tell a multigenerational saga that takes place in an unnamed country very much like Chile. We see the destruction of democracy and the rise of a cruel dictator who tries to eliminate all opposition. I wanted to show that life goes in a circle, events are intertwined, and that history repeats itself, there is no beginning and no end, Allende said about her sprawling, narrative. Czeslaw Milosz, Bells in Winter? (1985) Country of origin: PolandReason for leaving: After surviving World War II in Poland and initially joining the postwar Communist government, Milosz defected in 1951, eventually emigrating to the United States in 1960. The Polish poet and Nobel Prize winner produced a quietly meditative work in 1985 that pointed toward the mysterious quality of existence, the inability to fully understand our own natures. Life was impossible, but was endured, he writes in Recess, capturing the exile's lament, the alienation of deracination, of living an arm's length away from oneself. Joseph Brodsky, Less Than One? (1986) Country of origin: Soviet UnionReason for leaving: Put on trial and into psychiatric institutions for his dissident beliefs, Brodsky was expelled from the Soviet Union in 1972. Brodsky was interested in the poet's role in society, and these essays, which deal with politics, literature and his own personal experience of exile, all get at this question. For him, poetry was the most democratic art, as he says in an essay about the West Indian poet Derek Walcott. It's the poet's embrace of individuality that makes him a necessary counterpoint an important thorn to the state. Nuruddin Farah, Maps? (1986) Country of origin: SomaliaReasons for leaving: Exiled from Somalia in the for writing about life under the harsh rule of the dictator Mohammed Siad Barre. In the first novel of his trilogy, Blood in the Sun, Farrah writes about a young man, an orphan, obsessed with his own origins. Growing up dislocated in the big city of Mogadishu and tormented by the need to avenge his father's death, the boy reflects all the struggles of national identity in a country torn from the traditional past and thrust into a violent future. Ariel Dorfman, Death and the Maiden? (1990) Country of origin: ChileReasons for leaving: A cultural adviser to the deposed socialist leader Salvador Allende, Dorfman was forced to flee the country in 1973. In his revenge fantasy of a play, Dorfman dramatized the confrontation between a woman who was
